Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nHost-less with the most-less?Emmy Awards will go hostless in 2019, echoing Oscars\n\nHonor roll:Emmys 2019: The nominations list\n\nWhich are the top program nominees?\n\n\"Thrones,\" which has won the drama series Emmy the last three times it was nominated (2015, 2016 and 2018), once was considered an overwhelming favorite to win that category again, but the odds may not be so certain in light of a much-criticized final season.\n\nThe comedy-series Emmy will feature a matchup of defending champs: 2018 winner \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" and the 2017 champ, \"Veep,\" which took a season off as Louis-Dreyfus was treated for breast cancer.\n\n'Veep' blessing:'It was a lifesaver': Julia Louis-Dreyfus on how 'Veep' helped her through cancer battle\n\nOther top program nominees include: Amazon's \"Mrs. Maisel,\" 20 nominations; HBO's \"Chernobyl,\" 19; NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" 18; HBO's \"Barry,\" 17; FX's \"Fosse/Verdon,\" 17; Netflix's \"When They See Us,\" 16; Netflix's \"Russian Doll,\" 13; Showtime's \"Escape at Dannemora,\" 12; and Amazon's \"Fleabag,\" 11.\n\nHBO leads the network pack in nominations, with a record 137, finishing ahead of Netflix (118); NBC (58); Amazon (47); CBS (43); FX (32); ABC (26); Hulu (20); Fox (18); and Showtime (18).\n\nWho's up for the big acting awards?\n\nPast winners, including Dreyfus, Viola Davis (ABC's \"How to Get Away with Murder\"), Rachel Broshanan (\"Mrs. Maisel\") and Bill Hader (\"Barry\"), will be back as nominees, joined by first-timers in the drama and comedy lead-acting categories, including Emilia Clarke (\"Thrones\"), Kit Harington (\"Thrones\"), Mandy Moore (NBC's \"This Is Us\"), Phoebe Waller-Bridge (Amazon's \"Fleabag\"); and Billy Porter (FX's \"Pose\").\n\nStill an Emmy favorite? Did 'Game of Thrones' really deserve those record-breaking Emmy nominations?\n\nWho will host the Emmys? No one\n\nThis year's ceremony will follow in the footsteps of the Academy Awards, which had no host this year. Although the Oscars ended up in that predicament after a controversy with comedian Kevin Hart, Fox chose to go without one.\n\nFox Entertainment CEO Charlie Collier said the decision was based on \"tradeoffs,\" with the time spent on a host's monologue and opening number now available to celebrate series that have finished or that are about to enter their final season, including Fox's \"Empire.\"\n\n\"So, we will go hostless this year, and I think it will give us more time to honor those shows,\" he said.\n\nWho's missing? Emmy snubs: George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Emma Stone left out of nominations\n\nAt the same time, Fox also doesn't have the kind of late-night performer that in recent years has become the go-to host for the other broadcast networks, which rotate hosting the Emmys. \"Saturday Night Live\" performers and writers Colin Jost and Michael Che hosted NBC's Emmy turn in 2018, while talk hosts Stephen Colbert of CBS and Jimmy Kimmel of ABC headlined the two previous ceremonies.\n\nKimmel, who's hosted the Oscars twice in addition to the Emmys, told TV writers earlier this month that hosting an awards show is a \"no-win situation\" that comes with guaranteed criticism.\n\n\"It was a very difficult job,\" he said. \"If you don't care what people say, it's a good gig. But I do, so for me, it's an (expletive) nightmare.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/15/emmys-2024-complete-winners-list/72102243007/", "title": "Emmys 2024 complete winners list: 'Beef,' 'Succession' and 'The Bear'", "text": "With six awards each, the Roy clan of \"Succession\" and the found family of “The Bear” were the Emmys' biggest winners. The HBO family dramedy and FX comedy dominated the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, including a best drama win for “Succession” and a best comedy win for “The Bear.”\n\nOr was the biggest winner really Elton John, who joined the ultra exclusive EGOT club with his win for outstanding variety special for \"Elton John: Farewell From Dodger Stadium\"? Either way, TV's biggest night came back in a big way Monday.\n\nAnother series that enjoyed Emmy gold is Netflix’s “Beef,” which earned five awards. The Lee Sung Jin-helmed miniseries, which won best limited/anthology series, earned stars Ali Wong and Steven Yeun awards for lead actress and lead actor in a limited series/TV movie.\n\n“Succession” and “The Last of Us,” HBO’s post-apocalyptic action-drama, were the top contenders this year, entering the show with 27 and 24 nominations, respectively. Neither “The Last of Us” nor fan-favorite \"Ted Lasso,\" which had 21 nods, took home any prizes during Monday's broadcast, though \"Last of Us\" nabbed two guest acting awards in last week's Creative Arts ceremonies.\n\nThis year’s Emmy Awards were postponed from Sept. 18, 2023 due to the dual writers and actors strikes.

(Her total now stands at 32, one more than the late Hungarian conductor Georg Solti.) \"I want to thank God for protecting me\" and she also thanked her mom and dad \"for loving me and pushing me\" as well as \"the queer community for your love and for inventing this genre.\" Mary J. Blige followed up the historic moment with a performance of \"Good Morning Gorgeous.\"\n\nBreak out the pitchforks for Kim Petras and Sam Smith's 'Unholy' show\n\nMadonna, known for being a fan of the \"provocative\" and \"troublemakers\" in general, introduces Sam Smith and Kim Petras' performance of their Grammy-winning hit \"Unholy.\" Smith looks downright devilish in red leather, high-heeled boots and horns singing in the center of a group of robed, grinding demonic folks, while Petras performs in a cage surrounded by women with whips.\n\nLate musicians Loretta Lynn, Christine McVie, Takeoff earn Grammy tributes\n\nKacey Musgraves performs an acoustic version of \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" to honor Lynn in the \"In Memoriam\" portion of the night.

If that wasn't emotional enough, Sheryl Crow, Bonnie Raitt and Mick Fleetwood finish with a tearjerking rendition of \"Songbird\" for Christine McVie.\n\nKendrick Lamar earns major rap honors with 'Mr. Morale'\n\nCardi B presents the award for best rap album to Lamar for \"Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.\" He says it was one of the \"toughest\" albums he's made, thanking his family for \"the courage and the vulnerability to share my truth and these stories (and) the fans for trusting me with these words.\"\n\nHarry Styles embraces the ol' razzle-dazzle with 'As It Was' performance\n\nHot off winning a Grammy, an ultra-glittery Harry Styles – who looks he decorated himself with tons of Christmas tinsel – dances around and sings \"As It Was\" with his band and a bunch of random people walking on a rotating stage.\n\nBad Bunny snags Grammy for best música urbana album\n\n\"I just made this album with love and passion, and when you do everything with love and passion, it's just easier,\" says Bad Bunny, accepting his honor for \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" and dedicating the Grammy win to Puerto Rico.\n\nIt's about damn time Lizzo rules the Grammy stage\n\n\"We're about to have some church up in here!\" Lizzo feels the spirit and comes to the stage to do a bit of her hit \"About Damn Time\" before launching into her empowerment anthem \"Special\" with a gold-drenched dancing gospel choir surrounding her.\n\nSam Smith, Kim Petras walk away with an 'Unholy' win\n\nBest pop duo/group performance goes to Sam Smith and Kim Petras' \"Unholy.\" \"This song has been such an incredible journey for me,\" says Petras, who receives rapturous applause when she announces she's the first transgender woman to win this category. She shouts out influences (\"I don't know if I'd be here without Madonna\") and also Smith: \"Sam, you are a true angel in my life.\"\n\nWillie Nelson wins country Grammy, Stevie Wonder leads a Motown medley\n\nA red-haired Shania Twain presents the Grammy for best country album.

Adele, meet The Rock.\n\nNoah walks through the crowd pointing out trivia: LL Cool J loves breakfast cereals, Cardi B loves presidents and Adele loves tea.

A night without any slaps, misread winners or terrible musical numbers is a good night for all.\n\nOn ABC Sunday, the 76th Primetime Emmy trophies glittered and hosts Eugene and Dan Levy lobbed jokes, while big emotions ruled the wins, some predictable and others truly shocking. The Emmys were fun, but also (as usual) too long and full of awkward bits about TV cops and doctors. But we can't have everything. We'll have to settle for some good winners this year: Victories for FX restaurant-set dramedy \"The Bear,\" Max's showbiz comedy \"Hacks,\" FX's historical epic \"Shogun\" and Netflix's limited-series phenomenon \"Baby Reindeer,\" which scored four major wins.\n\nHighlights from the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards:\n\n'Hacks' stuns with outstanding comedy win\n\nAlthough last year's winners and nearly every Emmy pundit predicted the top comedy award would go to FX's \"The Bear,\" it was \"Hacks,\" Max's comedy about an older comedian played by Jean Smart that triumphed when the final award was announced by Catherine O'Hara (who, with an appearance from Annie Murphy, made it a full \"Schitt's Creek\" reunion).\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n\"Hacks\" producers Paul W. Downs, Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky were just as stunned (but elated) as the rest of us as they accepted the award.\n\n\"We really feel like (comedy) can bridge divide when you laugh with someone, you have something in common with them,\" Aniello said. \"So please support comedy, it speaks truth to power. Support your local comedian!\"\n\n'Shogun' wins the top drama prize, Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai have emotional wins for acting awards\n\nThe momentum didn't start until the night was nearly over, but after many other categories and wins for other series, my pick for best TV show of the year, \"Shogun,\" finally started getting the awards it so deserves (at least in Sunday's ceremony, after it won 14 last weekend at the Creative Arts Emmys, a record for a drama series in a single season). That included the biggest of the night, outstanding drama series, with star and producer Hiroyuki Sanada helping accept the award for the bilingual series in Japanese. But that wasn't all.\n\nSanada also won for best actor in a drama series for his role as a political power player in feudal Japan in the FX adaptation of the James Clavell historical novel. And Anna Sawai won best drama actress for playing noblewoman and translator Toda Mariko.\n\n\"It was an East meets West dream project, with respect,\" Sanada said of the production, which brought together American and Japanese filmmakers to tell the story of the first English contact with Japan in the year 1600. \"And 'Shogun' taught me that when people work together we can make miracle. We can create a better future together.\"\n\nJodie Foster wins for actress in a limited series, gets standing ovation\n\nAs decorated an actress as Jodie Foster is, she's never won an Emmy award before tonight. But she took to the stage to enormous applause to accept the award for outstanding actress in a limited series for her phenomenal performance in HBO's \"True Detective: Night Country,\" filmed mostly in Iceland but set in an Indigenous community in frosty Alaska.\n\nFoster thanked her director Issa López, her co-star Kali Reis and her family, but \"mostly the indigenous people ... of Northern Alaska. Mostly they told us their stories and they allowed us to listen. It was love, love, love...\"\n\nNetflix's 'Baby Reindeer' nearly sweeps with wins for Richard Gadd, Jessica Gunning, limited series\n\nNetflix limited series \"Baby Reindeer\" took over the streaming service earlier this year as one of its most-watched shows of all time, and Sunday it took over the Emmys' limited-series category. The based-on-a-true-story series follows a man who survived sexual abuse and assault and then was later stalked and harassed by a woman he meets in a chance encounter. The deeply intense and dark series had a great night. First Jessica Gunning, who played the stalker, won the award for outstanding supporting actress in a limited series. Next, creator, writer and star Richard Gadd won for writing the series, and gave a raw and heartfelt speech.\n\n\"Look, 10 years ago I was down and out, right? I never ever thought I'd get my life together,\" he said. \"And then here I am, just over a decade later, picking up one of the biggest writing awards in television. I don't mean that to sound arrogant, I mean that as encouragement to anyone who's going through a difficult time right now, to persevere.\"\n\nGadd was back up onstage to accept the award for outstanding actor in a limited series, a win he wasn't prepared for as he fumbled over his quick acceptance speech. But at least he managed to remember to thank his mom and dad this time. And then he showed up at the mic one more time when the \"Reindeer\" won for outstanding limited series.\n\nJohn Leguizamo cheers Emmys diversity, but reminds us Hollywood doesn't change overnight\n\nEmmy winner John Leguizamo introduced the chairman of the Television Academy, Chris Abrego, with a speech about the struggle TV has had representing people of color, particularly Latino people. He mentioned the limited representations of himself he could see on TV as a kid, caricatures like Speedy Gonzales from \"Looney Tunes.\"\n\n\"I used to watch 'Star Trek' and think, 'Wow, in the future there won't be an Latin people,'\" he deadpanned. The actor, who recently took out a full-page ad in the New York Times encouraging the TV Academy to nominate people of color for their extraordinary work, praised the diversity of the nominees this year, and appeared to bring nominee Selena Gomez to tears.\n\n\"But we need more stories from excluded groups: Black, Asian, Jewish, Arab, LGBTQ+ and disabled,\" he went on. \"This show tonight is proof that our industry is making progress.\"\n\n'Fargo' star Lamorne Morris is the night's giddiest winner\n\nIn one of the first surprises of the night, Lamorne Morris, most known for sitcom \"New Girl,\" won out against stiff competition for outstanding supporting actor in a limited series for his performance in FX's \"Fargo.\" The crowd went wild and a visibly elated Morris thanked God, his mother and promised to thank everyone he forgot on a podcast (an Emmy first? Maybe!) And he had plenty of love for his fellow nominees: \"Robert Downey, Jr. I have a poster of you in my house, please sign it!\"\n\nJohn Oliver wins again, dedicates it to all the good dogs\n\nJohn Oliver's HBO series \"Last Week Tonight\" can't stop winning Emmy Awards (it's up to 30 after Sunday night), so the comedian has had plenty of opportunities to make an acceptance speech. After thanking his staff, his wife and his kids (messing up one of their names), he moved on to thanking the most important being out there: his dog. Getting emotional talking about how his late pup helped him through the pandemic and life, the orchestra started to play him off. So the frequently foul-mouthed Oliver spouted some profanities (and was bleeped by the broadcast). Oliver was able to speak again without play-off music, and say a word for all the good boys and girls out there. It was clearly the most emotional the audience got all night. Because dogs are that good.\n\n'Murphy Brown' legend Candice Bergen pokes at Republican VP nominee JD Vance\n\nFive-time Emmy winner and star of shows like \"Murphy Brown\" and movies like \"Miss Congeniality,\" Candice Bergen took the stage to present the award for outstanding actress in a comedy (to Jean Smart, who won for \"Hacks\" for the third time), and used her time at the mic for political humor. She mentioned the time Republican Vice President Dan Quayle spoke out against \"Murphy\" after the unmarried character became pregnant and decided to raise her baby. She then lobbed a loaded joke at current GOP VP nominee JD Vance, without even mentioning his name.\n\n\"Today a Republican candidate for vice president would never attack a woman for having kids. So as they say, my work here is done. Meow.\"\n\nThe double-barreled joke played Vance's past comments noting that only women with families cared about the fate of the nation. He also bemoaned the nation being run by \"a bunch of childless cat ladies.\"\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas makes history with win for 'The Bear,' beats Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett\n\nThe TV Academy is saying \"yes, chef!\" Again. And they probably will keep saying it all night long. FX's \"comedy\" \"The Bear\" walked away with four statues Sunday: Outstanding supporting actor in a comedy for Ebon Moss-Bacharach, outstanding actor in a comedy for Jeremy Allen White, outstanding directing for a comedy for Christopher Storer and an emotional and historic win for Liza Colón-Zayas in outstanding supporting actress in a comedy. The actress is the first Latina woman to win in this category, a milestone she acknowledged in a short but powerful speech that had her category competitors Streep and Burnett cheering. It was hard not to get emotional, too.\n\n“It’s an epic honor. … People can see this and see that it is possible,\" Colón-Zayas said to press backstage after her win.\n\nHosts Eugene and Dan Levy 'applaud bad parenting' and smash their Emmy Awards monologue\n\nFather-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy were the first to admit they aren't stand-up comedians when they took to the stage for the opening monologue to Emmys, but that didn't stop them absolutely killing it with their sweet and dry wit. Nobody was offended, there were many genuine laughs in the room and it was all over in a quick seven minutes. That's all we could ever want or need from an opening monologue.\n\nThe Levys hit the right balance of light-hearted and biting jokes, and the right people (and corporations) were always the butts of the gags: Each other, the TV Academy and FX's \"The Bear\" pretending to be a comedy. Eugene promised that he wouldn't make a joke about tense restaurant-set series being nominated as a comedy because, \"in the true spirit of 'The Bear,' we will not be making any jokes.\"\n\nThey topped it all off by introducing \"stars of 'The Golden Bachelor' Steve Martin and Martin Short,\" and it set the tone for a great night.\n\nLaverne Cox, 'Baby Reindeer' star Nava Mau tear up over making trans history\n\nThe Emmy awards hadn't even officially started when the tears started flowing Sunday night. The normally bubbly E! red carpet show host Laverne Cox was brought to tears as she embraced \"Baby Reindeer\" star Nava Mau, who got similarly emotional. Both actresses have made Emmys history as trans women: Cox, the first trans person to ever earn an acting nomination for Netflix's \"Orange is the New Black\" in 2014; and Mau, the first trans woman to be nominated for best supporting actress in a limited series for \"Baby Reindeer\" this year.\n\n\"I'm so proud of you,” Cox told Mau, wiping away tears. \"Ten years ago, I became the first openly transgender person to be nominated for an acting Emmy, and 10 years later, I'm not the last.\"\n\nThe best dressed stars who walked the Emmys red carpet\n\nBefore entering Los Angeles' Peacock Theater, TV's A-listers served on the red carpet. They strutted, sashayed and swaggered in gorgeous gowns accessorized with megawatt smiles.\n\nUSA TODAY's Erin Jensen has picked the best looks that have sauntered across the red carpet so far, from Selena Gomez to \"3 Body Problem\" star Eiza González.

If you don't, the show is available for streaming on CBS All Access and on live TV packages through services such as YouTube TV and Hulu live TV.\n\nYou can stream all the red carpet arrivals on Grammy.com.\n\nNotable 2020 Grammy nominees\n\nLizzo received the most nominations – eight, including album (\"Cuz I Love You\"), record and song (\"Truth Hurts\") of the year. She's followed by Lil Nas X and Eilish, who are tied with six nods each. Artists with five nominations include Ariana Grande, H.E.R. and Finneas O'Connell.\n\nEilish, 18, joins Lizzo, 31, in the album of the year category with her genre-bending, critically acclaimed debut \"When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?\" The trend-setting teen, whose music has amassed more than 15 billion combined streams across platforms, is also up for record and song of the year for No. 1 hit \"Bad Guy.\" That makes her the youngest nominee in Grammy history to be nominated in all four major categories, according to the Recording Academy.\n\nLil Nas X, 20, whose real name is Montero Hill, is similarly up for best album with his eight-song debut \"7.\" \"Old Town Road,\" his country-rap collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus that topped the charts for a record-breaking 19 consecutive weeks this summer, is nominated for best pop/duo group performance, and his follow-up single \"Panini\" is up for best rap/sung performance.\n\nGrande's five nods include record (\"7 Rings\") and album of the year (\"Thank U, Next\"). The best album category is rounded out by Bon Iver's \"I, I,\" Lana Del Rey's \"Norman F***ing Rockwell,\" H.E.R.'s \"I Used to Know Her\" and Vampire Weekend's \"Father of the Bride.\"\n\n10 best albums of 2019, including Billie Eilish, Lana Del Rey and FKA Twigs\n\nGrammy nominations: Lizzo leads, Billie Eilish makes history, and 'Old Town Road' scores\n\nWho got snubbed?\n\nThough this year's nominations shined a light on new artists, established favorites, such as Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen, were left in the dark.\n\n10-time Grammy winner Swift made history in 2016 by becoming the first female artist to win album of the year twice, for \"1989\" and \"Fearless\" (a feat managed a year later by Adele, with \"25\" and \"21\"). Swift's Grammys streak has slowed: Her divisive \"Reputation\" earned just one nod in 2018 for best pop vocal album, and this year, she garnered only three nominations, including song of the year for \"Lover.\"\n\nHer critically beloved album \"Lover\" failed to land a best album nod but showed up in best pop vocal album. Her pro-LGBTQ anthem \"You Need to Calm Down\" eked out a nomination for best pop solo performance but missed out on record of the year.\n\nSimilarly, 20-time winner Springsteen has been a reliable Grammy presence since 1984 and was honored in 2013 by the Recording Academy's charity arm as MusiCares Person of the Year. The Boss returned this summer with the country-tinged \"Western Stars,\" which marked his first album of solo material since 2012's \"Wrecking Ball.\" Voters didn't welcome him back with open arms, snubbing \"Western Stars\" and Springsteen entirely.\n\nGrammy snubs 2020: Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen miss out on major nominations\n\nWho's hosting the Grammys?\n\nAfter hosting the 2019 Grammys, Alicia Keys is back and ready to take on the gig for the second year in a row. With 15 Grammy wins, Keys is certainly qualified.\n\n\"It’s almost like a marathon: You can’t just run a marathon (once),\" Keys said of her desire to host a second time. \"I feel like now, more than ever, I’m familiar with the space on multiple levels. It’s going to be an exciting, inclusive, beautiful experience, and that’s what I want to create.”\n\n2020 Grammy nominations: See the complete list of artists up for an award\n\nWho's performing?\n\nThis year's Grammys should be a big night for Eilish and Lizzo, not just because of their nominations but also because they'll each make their Grammys stage debuts.\n\nDemi Lovato will also take the stage, marking her first live performance since she was hospitalized after a possible drug overdose in 2018.\n\n\"I told you the next time you’d hear from me I’d be singing,\" Lovato wrote on Instagram Tuesday, along with the announcement.\n\nAlso returning to the show is Grande, who didn't attend last year after a dispute with Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich.\n\nEhrlich will be honored in a tribute performance Sunday featuring artists involved in his 40-year career. Performers will include Camila Cabello, John Legend, Cyndi Lauper and Ben Platt, among others.\n\nPower couple Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani will perform together at the show for the first time. Additionally, Billy Ray Cyrus, Lil Nas X, BTS, Diplo and more will join forces for an \"Old Town Road All-Stars\" performance.\n\nAerosmith, Run-D.M.C, Charlie Wilson, Bonnie Raitt, Camila Cabello, H.E.R., the Jonas Brothers, Rosalía and Tyler, The Creator will all also take the stage.\n\nSunday’s show will also pay tribute to rapper Nipsey Hussle, who was shot to death outside his Marathon clothing store in the South Los Angeles neighborhood where he was from in March 2019. DJ Khaled, John Legend, Roddy Ricch, Kirk Franklin, Meek Mill and YG will honor Hussle's legacy with a performance. The late rapper is nominated for three awards this year including best rap song.\n\nWho's presenting?\n\nFamous faces set to hand out the golden gramophones include Trevor Noah and Jim Gaffigan, who are both nominated for Best Comedy Album, as well as Brandi Carlile and Tanya Tucker, who are also set to perform.\n\nAlso presenting are previous Grammy winners Common, Cynthia Erivo, Dua Lipa, Billy Porter, Smokey Robinson, Shania Twain, Keith Urban and Stevie Wonder, as well as past Grammy nominees Ava DuVernay and Bebe Rexha.\n\nMusic industry titans Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne will also hand out trophies.\n\nHow are the Grammy Awards different this year?\n\nThis year's Grammys will have more women, people of color and young people choosing who wins.\n\nResponding to criticism that the awards show has lacked diversity among nominees and winners, the Recording Academy invited 900 members to join the voting body, emphasizing women, people of color and those under the age of 39, or some combination of the three.\n\nWho will be honored at Grammy Awards events?\n\nGrammys fun kicks off way before the main awards show begins.\n\nOne of the most famous lead-up events is record producer Clive Davis' star-studded pre-Grammys gala, held this year on the Saturday night before the show.\n\nAt this year's gala, three-time Grammy winner Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will be recognized as the 2020 Grammy Salute to Industry Icons honoree for his 25-year career in the music industry.\n\nThe Friday before the Grammys, rock band Aerosmith will be honored as the 2020 Person of the Year for MusiCares, the Recording Academy's charity for musicians in critical financial need.

Martin, best-selling author of the book series on which \"GoT\" is based, and Ryan Condal (\"Colony\").\n\nMartin suggested in May on his blog that readers could get hints about the project by reading his novel \"Fire & Blood.\" The book is described as a Targaryen history and is set 300 years before the events of \"GoT,\" which featured one of the family's most famous descendants, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke).\n\nPotential 'GoT' descendants:A 'Game of Thrones' final season do-over?

The USA TODAY Fact Check team is dedicated to verifying claims and fighting misinformation. Here's a list of recent fact-checks related to the 2020 election:\n\nOn counting votes\n\nFact check: Typo led to false post about Michigan votes showing up 'magically' for Biden\n\nA typo by a local Michigan county accounts for a sudden increase in Biden votes. The error was quickly corrected, and framing the incident as evidence of fraud is a gross mischaracterization.\n\nFact check: Democrat-led states did not stop counting votes for no reason\n\nMail-in ballots take longer to count, so many states counted overnight. Reports of counting delays or stoppages were either explained or false.\n\nFact check: That spike in the Wisconsin vote tally was expected and legitimate, not fraud\n\nThe vote tally in Wisconsin jumped at 3:30 a.m. on Nov. 4 because that's when officials finished counting the city of Milwaukee's absentee ballots, a group of votes expected to lean heavily left. It's false to call the spike in the voting count fraud.\n\nFact check: No, Wisconsin did not take a break from counting election results\n\nSome of the state's election results arrived late due to an influx of mail-in ballots, not because officials took a break. And President-elect Joe Biden never held a large lead there.\n\nFact check: Post-election ballot counting not dependent on state's party\n\nNone of the seven key states left in play on Nov. 4 were fully Democrat-run, some more than others. And, the time it took to count ballots in each state can be explained by circumstances or state law.\n\nFact check: Claim saying ongoing ballot counting is cheating, voter fraud is inaccurate\n\nA claim that ongoing ballot counting in Pennsylvania is cheating or fraudulent is false.\n\nFact check: Votes in Virginia accidentally tallied for Biden, error quickly fixed\n\nThere were 100,000 Central Absentee Precinct ballots that were mistakenly entered for Joe Biden in Fairfax County's unofficial election results spreadsheet, but the error was quickly noticed and fixed. The county's spreadsheet has been amended, and the state Board of Election's total votes counted tally never reflected the error.\n\nFact check: Georgia ballot curing is not election fraud\n\nBallot curing is a legal process that ensures voters who cast their ballots by Election Day have a chance to see their vote counted. It's allowed in many states, and there is no evidence ballot curing was used to commit election fraud in Georgia.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin county did not have a glitch that stole votes from Trump\n\nA data entry error by the Associated Press left presidential totals transposed for several minutes, but election officials were not involved. The votes in Rock County were counted following standard procedure.\n\nFact check: No, Wisconsin votes don’t have to be counted by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3\n\nVoters in line at 8 p.m. on Election Day can legally cast their vote. No judge made this ruling, and an earlier ruling from a federal judge — since upheld by an appeals panel — actually did the opposite, allowing any absentee ballots returned by Nov. 9 to be counted, as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nOn the outcome, past election comparisons\n\nFact check: Trump lost the 2020 presidential election\n\nAnalyses of the 2020 election results explain Trump's loss to Biden.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden has secured enough electors from certified results to be elected president\n\nIn the false map, Gateway Pundit excludes results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. President-elect Joe Biden won all six states, and all six have certified their results.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden legally won presidential election, despite persistent contrary claims\n\nBiden legally won the popular vote and obtained enough electoral votes to claim the win. There's no evidence of voter fraud, despite widespread, unfounded claims.\n\nFact check: Joe Biden outperformed Hillary Clinton in most major metro areas\n\nBiden received more votes than Hillary Clinton in many of the country's major metro areas. The claims that the four swing states listed are led by Democrats and that votes exceeded the number of voters registered in those states are also false.\n\nFact check: Biden won popular, Electoral College votes in several battleground states\n\nThe claim references unproven and falsified allegations to support statements about flipping votes in battleground states from Biden to Trump. There is no evidence to support claims of cheating, outstanding software glitches or illegal voting in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nFact check: Biden won the most total votes – and the fewest total counties – of any president-elect\n\nWith over 81 million votes, Biden received the most votes of any presidential candidate in history. It is also true that he won a record-low number of counties – but counties vary by population size, so those wins don't correlate with the popular vote.\n\nFact check: Meme is missing context, potentially misleads on support for Biden, Trump and Obama\n\nPeople vote, not places, and Biden won the most populous counties in the country, according to a Census Bureau report. It's also disingenuous to suggest Biden's small campaign events indicated a lack of support, given the ongoing viral pandemic.\n\nFact check: Biden got record number of popular votes despite small campaign events\n\nThe Trump campaign disregarded many COVID-19 precautions and hosted large crowds, while Biden made following coronavirus guidelines central to his efforts. Biden's lack of crowds does not translate to a lack of support from voters, but rather a consistent adherence to pandemic safety guidelines.\n\nFact check: After endorsing him, New York Post now pushes Trump to accept Biden's victory\n\nBased on our research, the claim that the New York Post published a cover and staff editorial urging President Trump to accept defeat is true; the items were published in print and online on Dec. 27.\n\nFact check: These 5 election statistics do not discredit Joe Biden's victory\n\nSocial media shared a meme with statistics that they claim discredits Joe Biden's victory. The meme compares information about former President Barack Obama in 2008 and President Donald Trump and Biden in 2020. It lists total number of votes received, includes the number of counties each candidate won; the fraction of bellwether counties each candidate won; whether they won Florida, Ohio and Iowa; and whether each candidate's political party won seats in the House of Representatives.\n\nOn calling states, certifying votes\n\nFact check: 14 of the first 25 states called went to Trump, contrary to viral claims\n\nThe claim that blue states were called immediately, while red states were not is false. Of the first 25 states called by the Associated Press, 14 were for Trump. There's also no evidence vote counting was paused to \"find\" ballots.\n\nFact check: Key Senate races left uncalled due to uncounted ballots, not fraud\n\nThe five states still not called on Nov. 5 still had unreported votes outstanding. None of those states had elected new Republican senators when the post was made, though some races appear as if they may eventually.\n\nFact check: Statistical analysis supporting pro-Trump Supreme Court case is 'ludicrous'\n\nThe votes still uncounted when Trump had his short-lived lead were largely absentee ballots from major cities. Those cities have consistently voted Democratic historically, and mail-in votes within them should be expected to lean even more that direction since Trump had attacked that method of voting leading up to the election while Biden encouraged it.\n\nFact check: CNN never made – or retracted – Arizona call for Joe Biden\n\nA spokesperson for CNN said the news network never called Arizona for Biden, and USA TODAY found no evidence indicating otherwise.\n\nFact check: Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted twice on certifying election results\n\nThe board of canvassers did initially split in a 2-2 vote, officials reversed course a few hours later and certified election results in Wayne County based on the condition that a comprehensive audit be conducted on precincts with out-of-balance tallies.\n\nFact check: Trump lawyer Sidney Powell falsely stated he won election 'by a landslide'\n\nSidney Powell did make the claim that Trump won the election \"by a landslide,\" the assertion is false. Joe Biden is the president-elect after having garnered enough electoral votes as a result of the popular vote across the country earlier this month.\n\nFact check: Nevada's AG did not admit to changing signature verification manually in election\n\nThe statement regarding allegations that votes were changed by a signature verification machine was made by the former attorney general of Nevada, a Republican and co-chairman of the Nevada Trump campaign, and not by current Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat.\n\nFact check: Political news website never called Pennsylvania for Joe Biden\n\nReal Clear Politics never called Pennsylvania or switched it from Biden as many social media posts claim, according to its co-founder and president, Tom Bevan, as well as its Washington bureau chief, Carl M. Cannon.\n\nFact check: Some electoral maps show Trump leading with 232 votes. They're wrong.\n\nEpoch Times, Gateway Pundit, and EveryLegalVote.com show a different electoral vote count for two reasons: They exclude states with pending litigation or recounts, subtracting votes from Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona, and in one case Virginia, from Biden. They also called North Carolina for Trump, though the state was not done counting as of publication time and has not been called by the Associated Press. Their counts are incorrect.\n\nFact check: Election unlikely to be decided in the House, even if Trump refuses to concede\n\nWhile all presidential elections have the potential to be decided in the House of Representatives under the Constitution, the post fails to mention key steps needed in order for the election to go to the House. Even if the election results were contested and Trump doesn't concede, experts have agreed that it is unlikely for Trump to win the election this way.\n\nFact check: Map showing Trump landslide based on false report of seized election servers in Germany\n\nThe false claim that Donald Trump received 410 electoral votes and Joe Biden received 128 is based on false reports that the U.S. Army seized servers with election information on them in a recent raid in Germany.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin bill does not decertify results and give Trump the win\n\nA Wisconsin Legislature bill would prioritize legislation addressing election laws. But it says nothing related to decertification or awarding the state to Trump. And in any case, the state’s electoral votes were already cast for Biden weeks ago. The claim is false.\n\nFact check: False news report indicates Biden plans to step down as president-elect\n\nA claim that President-elect Joe Biden is stepping down because of health concerns is false, the news report that makes the statement is faked.\n\nFact check: Trump pressured officials in Georgia to recalculate state's vote in his favor\n\nOn Jan. 3, the Washington Post broke the news of an hourlong call in which President Donald Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes.\" Since then, Trump has doubled down on his baseless claims of electoral fraud, while Democrats have expressed outrage.\n\nFact check: No, court did not rule 200,000 Wisconsin ballots were illegitimate\n\nA Wisconsin statute allows voters to declare themselves as \"indefinitely confined.\" They can then cast an absentee ballot without providing a photo ID, as would be required for in-person voting or a traditional absentee ballot. Trump and other Republicans have attacked this method of voting as improper. A final ruling from the state Supreme Court released Dec. 14 said it's up to each voter whether they meet the requirements for being \"indefinitely confined\" — not clerks or anyone else.\n\nOn voter registration, turnout\n\nFact check: Wisconsin has more registered voters than ballots cast\n\nThe number for registered Wisconsin voters stated by a Facebook image is incorrect. Over 3.6 million voters were registered in the state as of Nov. 1, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission, which denied there being more ballots than registered voters.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin turnout in line with past elections, didn't jump 22% as claimed\n\nTurnout is measured as a percentage of eligible voters, not registered voters. Donald Trump Jr.’s figures use eligible voters for the 2016 figure but registered voters for 2020. Using the proper denominator for 2020 shows a turnout around 72%, firmly in the range of past presidential elections.\n\nFact check: Milwaukee wards did not have more votes for president than registered voters\n\nThe numbers cited by Milwaukee City Wire do not match data from the Milwaukee County clerk’s office, which show the number of registered voters exceeded ballots cast.\n\nFact check: Claim of Georgia vote spike for Biden after pipe burst at counting site is false\n\nThe pipe leak happened early in the morning of Nov. 3, while ballot counting without monitors took place Nov. 4 and was not related to the pipe incident.\n\nFact check: Over 159 million people voted in the US general election\n\nThe claim cites correct vote totals for Trump (74 million) and Biden (81 million), but it falsely reports the number of registered voters. More than 159 million registered voters cast ballots in the general election, out of 239 million eligible voters.\n\nFact check: False claim that 'fake votes' found during recount in Dane County, Wis.\n\nThe repeated initials referred to in the claim aren’t those of a voter; they’re initials of the clerk who issued the absentee ballots.\n\nFact check: Image from 2017 White House event altered to make claim about votes for Biden\n\nThe original image is from a 2017 event where Trump spoke about deregulation goals and cut a ribbon across stacks of paper that represented current regulations and 1960 regulations.\n\nFact check: States don't have more than 100% voter turnout in an election\n\nUpdated data and individual state reporting show no state had more than 100% voter turnout for the 2020 election. The implication that Democrats doctored election results to show higher turnout than possible is based off outdated data that has since been updated.\n\nFact check: There was strong Navajo support for Biden, but numbers cited in claim have changed\n\nThe statistics in the social media posts are inaccurate – possibly because they came from an article that cited returns before the full vote count was in. However, it is true that among the three Arizona counties that overlap the Navajo Nation, the vote went 58% to Biden and 42% to Trump, with some individual precincts on the Navajo Nation up to 90% for Biden.\n\nFact check: Claim that voting noncitizens affected 2020 election outcome is unverified\n\nVoting in federal elections is reserved for U.S. citizens and few noncitizens knowingly register to vote. The claim that voter turnout from noncitizens affected the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race in battleground states is plausible but unproven.\n\nFact check: Dual language ballots create confusion in Georgia's Gwinnett County data\n\nThe Voting Rights Act ensures language assistance to individuals not proficient in English by providing electoral material and other information in their native language. Gwinnett County meets the thresholds to require electoral material in another language due to its sizable Latino or Hispanic population. Single ballots are thus printed on two sheets, one in English and one in Spanish, which are both counted in the county's election summary results and cannot be omitted under federal law.\n\nFact check: North Carolina vote total for governor didn't exceed ballots cast\n\nOur research of the official vote tally shows the assertion that only 4.5 million votes were cast is wrong, rendering moot any issue about a purported half-million or more \"extra\" votes. The vote totals for two gubernatorial candidates are correct for the time the claim was made, but they are incomplete, missing three candidates. Any suggestions of fraud are baseless\n\nFact check: Kanye West, other third-party candidates, not leading in Kentucky voting\n\nThe screenshot showing a number of third-party presidential candidates leading at the polls in Kentucky depicts fake election results. Kanye West has not received 40,000 votes in Kentucky.\n\nFact check: Michigan townships had more registered voters than votes\n\nThe claim that four townships in Michigan logged 290,000 more votes than there are people is false. Voter turnout data shows no township in Michigan had more than 100% turnout for the 2020 presidential election. There were some cases of errors in voter turnout rates, however, the errors were fixed, and there is no evidence that four townships logged more votes than there are people.\n\nFact check: False claim of fraud in Arizona voter registrations\n\nThere is no proof behind the claim that 2,012 Arizona voters are registered under one address.\n\nElection Day debunks\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania voters exposed to COVID-19 can still vote\n\nPennsylvania officials did not \"attempt to silence voters\" exposed to COVID-19 by telling them via letter they can't vote in person. Letters have been sent to Pennsylvanians exposed to the coronavirus since the beginning of the pandemic, and the letter makes no mention of the election.\n\nFact check: Poll watcher turned away at Philadelphia polling station in misunderstanding\n\nA poll watcher was turned away from a Philadelphia polling station due to a legal misunderstanding, but he was allowed back in after the mistake was recognized. This appears to be an isolated incident.\n\nFact check: 'Nothing wrong' with Kentucky county's voting Nov. 3, clerk says\n\nA Facebook post made on Oct. 13 about a voting holdup in Fayette County, Kentucky, was shared as if it was made on Nov. 3. While there was a brief hold up in voting the day the post was created, the Fayette County clerk said the delay was mischaracterized in the post – and the timing of the post's share is misleading.\n\nFact check: Video misrepresents timing and severity of Scranton ballot-scanning machine outage\n\nVoting machines did go down in several polling districts in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the morning of Election Day, but all machines were up and running in under 2.5 hours. The video, labeled \"BREAKING,\" was shared several hours after the issues were fixed.\n\nFact check: Image does not show massive wall in front of White House\n\nThe image at hand does not show a massive wall in front of the White House; it's fabricated from a 2009 image. The National Park Service confirmed the photo does not resemble the actual fencing at the White House that federal authorities did put up.\n\nFact check: Bricks in Detroit are for construction projects, not to incite violence\n\nThere's no evidence bricks were purposely staged in Detroit to incite violence. Detroit police and the owner of a local construction company confirmed the bricks photographed are for construction projects.\n\nFact check: No one was allowed to vote after Nov. 3\n\nDespite the post's claims, all Americans, including Democrats, must vote on or before Election Day. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked by that day.\n\nOn election technology\n\nFact check: Dominion Voting machines create ballots only for audits, testing\n\nIt is true that Dominion Voting machines create ballots, for testing, audits and after a voter has voted and approves the ballot creation. But assertions that machines can be hacked, votes were dumped and test ballots can be counted are false. The federal government and election experts discovered no election fraud on the part of Dominion Voting Systems or its voting machines.\n\nFact check: Dominion voting machines didn't delete votes from Trump, switch them to Biden\n\nA national election security coalition announced on Thursday that \"there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\" Other experts and Dominion itself also condemned the claims.\n\nFact check: Claims linking Dominion Voting Systems to Democrats are wrong or misleading\n\nIt is true that Nancy's Pelosi's former chief of staff is a lobbyist for Dominion Voting Systems, which supplied the election software in Michigan and other states. But Republicans have lobbying ties to Dominion, as well, making this claim partly false.\n\nFact check: Video claim that Dominion tech manipulated Georgia votes is false\n\nState and local election officials and a spokesperson for Dominion explain such manipulation is not possible. Our research uncovered no evidence to support the claim.\n\nFact check: False claim that electronic voting software companies Dominion and Smartmatic have closed\n\nNeither Dominion nor Smartmatic has closed in the aftermath of the election and their CEOs are not \"on the run.\"\n\nFact check: A 37-vote change in Georgia was the result of human error, not vote-flipping\n\nState and local elections officials have denied the claim and explained that a 37-vote difference was the result of a human tabulation error, not the fault of Dominion.\n\nFact check: Viral photo shows fake logo and slogan for Dominion Voting Systems\n\nArchived and current versions of Dominion Voting System's logo show that the company's actual logo is a red ballot going into a red ballot box, suggesting the image in posts online is a doctored version of the authentic logo.\n\nFact check: School bus in Arizona was full of office equipment, not voting machines\n\nThe Buckeye Police Department confirmed that the bus contained \"office equipment,\" not voting machines.\n\nFact check: No, Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems\n\nThere is no familial relationship between Joe Biden's relatives with the last name Owens and Stephen Owens, the co-founder of a private equity firm that acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.\n\nFact check: Hugo Chávez's family does not own Dominion Voting Systems\n\nHugo Chávez did not found Dominion Voting Systems, nor does his family own a stake of the company. Dominion was founded in Canada in 2003 and its majority owner is Staple Street Capital, which is based in New York.\n\nClaims of discarded, destructed ballots\n\nFact check: Trump ballots were not thrown out as claimed by fake poll worker\n\nInstagram user @omg_seabass, who claimed to be an Erie County poll worker, is not in any way associated with the county, and the claim has been denied by Carl J. Anderson III, the chair of Erie County's Board of Elections. Additionally, poll workers do not have access to marked-up ballots in a way that would allow disposal.\n\nFact check: False claim that viral video shows Trump ballots being burned\n\nCity officials in Virginia Beach, Virginia, have confirmed that a video shows sample ballots. There is no evidence that ballots burning in a viral video were real ballots.\n\nFact check: Partly false claim about discarded ballots in Pennsylvania amplified by Eric Trump\n\nIt is true that nine military ballots were incorrectly discarded in a dumpster — seven of which were cast for President Donald Trump — were incorrectly discarded in a dumpster, but the incident was an error by a contractor, not evidence of cheating. The Pennsylvania secretary of state also stated that the situation was not \"intentional fraud.\"\n\nFact check: Post about stolen – and returned – Arizona ballots lacks context\n\nIt’s true that stolen ballots were found under a rock in Arizona. But the ballots had not yet been opened or filled out, and all 18 of the stolen ballots were returned to the voters three days prior to Election Day.\n\nFact check: Viral video claiming to show 'shredded mail-in ballots' is of printing waste\n\nA company confirmed that the video is of printing waste, not ballots that were not delivered. The applications are blank, not \"for Trump.\"\n\nFact check: False claim that photo of discarded mail shows ballots cast for Trump\n\nSeven discarded ballots for Trump were found in Pennsylvania after an error by a temporary contractor, not the U.S. Postal Service. Based on our research, the claim that a photo shows mail-in ballots cast for President Donald Trump discarded on the side of a road is false, and our research did not reveal discarded Trump ballots in California or Texas.\n\nFact check: 2018 empty mail-in ballot envelopes in California dumpster spur false fraud claims\n\nSonoma County officials confirmed that the photos on social media are of old empty envelopes from the November 2018 election and were recycled after the state's mandated 22-month ballot preservation period.\n\nOn absentee, early voting\n\nFact check: False QAnon claim that Trump secretly watermarked mail-in ballots to prove fraud\n\nA QAnon-adjacent conspiracy theory claims President Donald Trump had mail-in ballots secretly watermarked to prove Democrats committed fraud, but federal officials and ballot printers confirmed to USA TODAY that's impossible. Mail-in ballots are designed by local governments and ordered from private printers.\n\nFact check: Wisconsin clerks followed guidance in place since 2016 about witnesses and absentee ballots\n\nThe claim that the Wisconsin Election Commission may have violated state law by allowing clerks to \"fix\" ballots is missing context, because the policy in question has been in place since 2016, without objection, was brought forth by Republicans and was unanimously passed by a nonpartisan commission.\n\nFact check: Mail-in ballots arriving after Election Day will count in some states\n\nSome states won't count ballots received after Election Day, but many have extensions that allow for ballots to arrive and be counted after Nov. 3.\n\nFact check: Michigan governor encourages voters to drop off ballots, not mail them\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told voters to deliver their ballots in person, but she never explicitly told voters not to mail their ballots. At the time the claim was made, on Oct. 19, experts nationwide concurred that it was too late to rely on the mail to deliver ballots on time.\n\nFact check: Alleged ‘backdated’ ballots wouldn’t have been counted even if USPS claim true\n\nAbsentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. Pease’s claims relate to actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5. Whatever happened to ballots then, no one was going to count and include them, so this claim is missing context.\n\nFact check: Woman in Indiana charged with modifying absentee ballot applications, not mail-in ballots\n\nReed was arrested for modifying 300 absentee ballot applications, not 400 ballots, that signed voters up for the Democratic primary without their consent during the June 2020 primary. Election officials were aware of the matter and were able to send voters new applications. No candidates were pre-marked, as the posts claim.\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania mail-in ballot claim mixes primary, general election data\n\nNumbers from the Pennsylvania Department of State show that over 2.6 million mail in ballots had been counted and over 3 million voters requested mail ballots by the Oct. 27 deadline. The false figure used in the claim originates from the number of mail in ballots requested for the Pennsylvania primary election or the number of registered Democrats that requested a mail ballot.\n\nFact check: Pennsylvania mail-in votes need 2 envelopes to be counted\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that officials can reject ballots that aren't properly enclosed in the required envelopes, and the state's secretary of state further confirmed the information is in an online voter guide. This claim is true.\n\nClick here for more general fact checks on voting by mail.\n\nOn poll workers, challengers and electors\n\nFact check: Viral video shows Pennsylvania poll workers fixing damaged ballots\n\nCounty officials confirmed that workers were fixing damaged ballots and the video has been manipulated to crop out bipartisan observers who witnessed the process. The damaged ballots have been preserved, and Pennsylvania's Election Code states damaged ballots must be duplicated.\n\nFact check: Videos showing crowd locked out of Detroit TCF Center with windows obstructed are missing context\n\nViral videos depict crowds of challengers stuck outside Detroit's TCF Center as election workers count ballots inside behind obstructed windows. Statements from officials and witnesses clarify that Republican challengers were not more frequently denied entry, and the TCF Center's windows were covered because election workers felt intimidated.\n\nFact check: Federal Election Commission chair echoes false claims of fraud\n\nThe quotes from FEC Chair Trey Trainor are real and came from an interview with Newsmax. But he's not the \"top boss of all the election officials,\" and the FEC's jurisdiction isn't related to vote counting or election security — only campaign finances. The post's claims are partly false, true only in that Trainor expressed his opinion about the election.\n\nFact check: State legislatures choose electors, but electors vote how state dictates\n\nIt is true the Constitution grants state legislatures the power to choose electors for the Electoral College. But it is false to suggest that legislatures retain this authority after a popular vote on Election Day. A \"safe harbor\" provision of the Electoral Count Act dictates changing the slate of electors after election day is a violation of federal law.\n\nClaims of dead voters\n\nFact check: False claim that deceased Michigan man voted in 2020\n\nWhile the screenshots posted to social media are real and can be replicated, Michigan’s Secretary of State's office debunked the claim as “misinformation,” and USA TODAY found evidence to support that.\n\nFact check: Lawsuit alleging errors in Detroit voter rolls was in 2019 and was settled\n\nThe report of a lawsuit alleging errors in Detroit voter rolls was accurate, but the posts fail to note that the case was filed in December and settled in June. It was not an issue in the 2020 election.\n\nFact check: No evidence vote was cast in Joe Frazier's name\n\nThere is no evidence to support this, and numerous election and county officials have confirmed that there is no evidence that dead people voted in Philadelphia.\n\nFact check: No evidence that 14,000 dead people cast ballots in Wayne County, Michigan\n\nThe list has been investigated and it was found that some individuals on the list were either still alive, or not living in Michigan. Other examples cited were the result of date of birth errors. Ballots cast by dead people in Michigan are rejected and there is no evidence of fraud.\n\nFact check: Claim that Pennsylvania case is proof of ‘dead people’ voting is under investigation\n\nWhile Pennsylvania’s ballot tracker does show a recorded mail-in ballot for a Denise Ondick, county officials have yet to determine this was an instance of voter fraud. Moreover, experts say voter fraud involving the deceased is rare.\n\nFact check: Thousands of ballots were not sent to dead people or pets in Nevada, Virginia\n\nAbout 500,000 voters in Virginia were sent vote-by-mail applications, not an actual ballot, that included incorrect return addresses. In Nevada, ballots for the primary election were returned due to a change of address. Election officials have not mailed absentee ballots in Nevada.

The remainder of the purges are largely voters who moved out of the county or died.\n\nBut an Arizona Republic analysis of Recorder’s Office data since 2008 shows the voter-purge policy isn't experienced equally across Maricopa County, home to 61 percent of all registered voters in the state. Purges of inactive voters in Maricopa County over the past 10 years have disproportionately affected lower-income communities, where minorities make up a larger share of the population, according to the analysis.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMORE: Voting hasn't been painless in Phoenix area. Will Tuesday be different?\n\nCritics of the county policy say the result is thousands of people who are eligible to vote will run into problems at the polls Tuesday, when they learn they are no longer on the rolls.\n\nThe Republic analysis shows that will happen more often to poor and minority voters, groups that are less likely to own a home and are more likely to change addresses.\n\nCivil-rights groups argue the state could do more — by automatically updating voters' registrations with new addresses when they are changed on their driver’s licenses, for example — to avoid disenfranchising citizens.\n\n\"It shouldn’t be this difficult,\" said Darrell Hill, a staff attorney with the ACLU. \"You shouldn’t have to jump through so many hoops to make sure you can cast a ballot.”\n\nFindings\n\nThe Republic analysis, which incorporated data from the Census Bureau, found:\n\nThe highest purge rates were in ZIP codes with larger minority populations and poverty rates that were at least 2.5 times that of the state.\n\nThe three ZIP codes with the highest purge rates —85281, 85034 and 85007 —were in Tempe and Phoenix. Voters in those areas were purged at more than twice the rate of the county as a whole.\n\nThe lowest voter-purge rates were in ZIP codes in Gilbert, Waddell and Peoria — 85298, 85355 and 85383 — areas that on average have smaller minority populations and have less poverty.\n\nAlthough the voter purges tended to be in areas with larger minority populations and higher poverty rates, it wasn't the case in every area.\n\nTo calculate the purge rate, The Republic divided the average voter purges in the years following elections by the average number of active voter registrations at the end of election years. Five election cycles were included in the analysis. The active registration numbers by year are an estimate based on the voter’s most current registration address or other updates, according to the recorder’s office.\n\nBattles over voting\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona sued the Arizona Secretary of State's Office this year, claiming the state doesn’t update voter-registration information when individuals change their address on their driver’s license.\n\nThe suit was filed on behalf of the League of Women Voters of Arizona, Arizona’s chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens and multiple voter-registration organizations.\n\nACLU sued after requesting in early August that Secretary of State Michele Reagan’s office update the addresses of more than 500,000 people to reflect new addresses they provided when they updated their Arizona driver’s licenses. The intent of the lawsuit was to ensure those individuals could vote in Tuesday's general election.\n\nReagan said she was working with the Arizona Department of Transportation to make those changes next year. But Reagan's bid for re-election ended in the primary, which means it will be left to Arizona’s new secretary of state to implement any potential changes.\n\nREAD MORE: Democrats seeing 'blue wave' in early voting\n\nReagan said the current system has been in place for more than 10 years and any changes must be managed carefully, given that it involves several systems and state agencies, including ADOT and county recorders, so voters’ information is handled securely.\n\n“What they were asking for was not good for voters because it could have led to massive confusion of people’s addresses getting changed right before an election,\" she said. \"These changes or upgrades are planned for 2019, which is a non-election year, and to us that makes the ACLU lawsuit just a moot point.”\n\nHill, the ACLU staff attorney, said a judge refused an emergency request to force Reagan to immediately update the addresses.\n\nThe case continues, he said, but thousands of voters may run into problems at the polls Tuesday.\n\nOpt in, opt out\n\nThe National Voter Registration Act requires that, unless a voter opts out, election officials automatically update addresses on voter rolls when a person moves and updates the address on their driver’s license.\n\nArizona requires voters to opt in to have their registration automatically update, or to affirm the address change.\n\nThat’s a violation of federal law, Hill said.\n\nIt's also one example of the confusing policies that create hurdles for eligible citizens to cast a ballot, Hill said.\n\n“The system is so confusing across Arizona, there’s little uniformity for a voter who’s just trying to vote,” Hill said.\n\nThe ACLU and the Arizona voter-registration organizations it represented won a parallel fight in August. The settlement covered voting-rights violations that disenfranchised Spanish-speaking, minority and low-income voters.\n\nHill said certain Arizona social-services agencies weren't providing voter-registration forms to their clients as required by federal law.\n\nREAD MORE: 43% say U.S. elections aren't fair, open\n\nFederal voting laws, recognizing that low-income and minority voters have been historically disenfranchised, have protections to ensure voter-registration opportunities.\n\nUnder the settlement, the Department of Economic Security and the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, or AHCCCS, agreed to send voter-registration forms in English and Spanish to about 300,000 people who had contact with the agencies between Aug. 1, 2017, and July 31. The letters were to be mailed by the end of August to give voters time to register for Tuesday's general election.\n\nAdditionally, ADOT, under the settlement, agreed to translate driver's license/ID card applications into Spanish. The forms, provided at ADOT offices, include an option to register to vote.\n\nFederal law requires that voter-registration information distributed in the four Arizona counties named in the lawsuit — Maricopa, Pima, Santa Cruz and Yuma — to be available in Spanish as well as English.\n\nPetra Falcon, executive director of immigrant-rights advocacy group Promise Arizona, applauded the agencies.\n\n“While the Arizona Secretary of State makes excuses as to why she can’t send a similar letter to at least 500,000 Arizonans who may have been denied their voting rights, these agencies are taking an active step to protect our fundamental right to vote,” she said in a statement following the settlement. “The right to vote is one of the most powerful tools the Latino community has.”\n\nThe politics of voting\n\nTuesday's elections will determine the balance of power in Congress, and many of those races are expected to be decided by narrow margins.\n\nArizona’s U.S. Senate race, for example, appears to be among the tightest in the nation, with Republican Rep. Martha McSally and Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema each leading in various polls.\n\nIt's typical of recent elections. And against that backdrop, voting policies often become political, said Rick Hasen, a University of California, Irvine, election-law expert.\n\n“Democrats have called for voter access and Republicans have called for (protections against) voter fraud and bloat on the rolls,” he said.\n\nStates have leeway in implementing voting policies. But federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the Help Americans Vote Act supersede state laws.\n\nElection lawsuits, like the ACLU's suits against Arizona officials, often reflect the larger battle between states' powers to control local elections and federal voting mandates.\n\n“The whole point of the NVRA is to balance these two things — the desire to maintain clean voter rolls and on the other hand making sure voters have access and the ability to vote,” Hasen said.\n\nArizona is one of two states that requires documentary proof of citizenship to vote in state elections.\n\nREAD MORE: Helen Purcell: I won't second-guess Adrian Fontes\n\nMaricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said that when he took office, he found about 100,000 state-issued voter-registration forms that employees had stockpiled in boxes. Staffers said the forms, under former Recorder Helen Purcell, a Republican, were not processed for registration because the voter did not show proof of citizenship.\n\nIn an interview with The Republic, Fontes, a Democrat who in 2016 unseated Purcell, a 28-year incumbent, said his staff checked state records and contacted voters in a painstaking attempt to register them.\n\n“That exercise took a great amount of time and resources, but we ended up bringing thousands and thousands of voters onto the voter rolls,\" he said. \"And we found several thousands of voters who were unfortunately kept off, kept out of voting in certain elections, and that could have been avoided.\"\n\nVoter fraud in Arizona since 2010\n\nPresident Donald Trump and conservatives across the U.S. have argued greater election-security measures are needed to limit voter fraud.\n\nTrump has claimed, without proof, that millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, and he created an executive order to ensure election integrity.\n\nOn Oct. 20, Trump tweeted, “All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING. Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!”\n\nREAD MORE: Elections official: Claims of widespread voter fraud are baseless\n\nConcern over voter fraud is a common refrain when conservatives lobby for policies to secure voter rolls and registration or tighten demands on what a voter will need to cast a ballot at the polls.\n\nBut voter-fraud convictions in Arizona remain consistently low.\n\nKatie Conner, a spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General's Office, said the agency tracks voter-fraud cases.\n\nSince 2010, the Arizona Attorney General’s Office has received 34 referrals — a period that's seen 16.1 million votes cast, according to data from the Secretary of State's Office.\n\nTwenty-two of the referrals resulted in convictions. One was overturned on appeal. And another was dismissed without prejudice. Seven cases were turned down and three remain active.\n\nThirteen of the convictions were in Maricopa County.\n\nReagan said nothing is more important than protecting the integrity of an election so that voters know their voice on candidates and election issues matters.\n\n“I think the National Secretary of State Association says it best, and it’s an idea that many of us have adopted whether Democrat or Republican,” she said. “It should be easy to vote and hard to cheat.”\n\n'No guarantee my vote would count'\n\nMateo Rios spotted a voter-registration table on his way to class at the Arizona State University West Campus in Glendale.\n\nThe 19-year-old had been meaning to register to vote since he moved back to Arizona from California in August for school. Realizing it was already mid-September, he decided to stop and sign up. Rios said he's an independent because he’s dissatisfied with both major parties.\n\nRios said he and a friend registered at the ASU voter drive. To make voting easier, he chose to have an early ballot sent to his apartment in Glendale.\n\nHe checked online about a week later to confirm his registration was complete. “It was there, my information was there and I was registered with the county,” he said.\n\nBut when friends began receiving early ballots, Rios' hadn't shown up. He checked his voter registration online.\n\n“It said no one was registered with my name, with my address,” he said. Rios said he called the Recorder’s Office on Tuesday and was told he was not in the system.\n\n“All they said I could do was go to the early-voting place and fill out a provisional ballot,\" he said. \"He gave me no guarantee my vote would count.”\n\nDisillusioned, Rios considered not voting.\n\n“I’ve read about voter suppression happening and people being taken out of registration all the time,” he said. “I was just really upset by it, and they really had no solution for me.”\n\nRios said his conscience convinced him to vote with a provisional ballot on Tuesday.\n\n“I’ve been saying how important it is to vote to people, to my friends and family,” he said. “There’s no way I can expect other people to vote when they’re angry with the government if I don’t do it.”\n\nREAD MORE: Why did so many young people register to vote?\n\nMichael Zubiria's experience with the voter rolls also was puzzling.\n\nWhen contacted by The Republic, the Phoenix Republican was shocked to learn he had been registered to vote in Arizona in 2008 and removed from the rolls in 2017.\n\nZubirias said he wasn't registered to vote in Arizona those years.\n\n\"There's not very many Zubirias in this country,” he said. “We're extremely rare, so I don't know who put me down as registered to vote because I never registered.\"\n\nThis year, he registered just before the cutoff so he can vote Tuesday. He said he's backing Doug Ducey, a Republican, for governor and wants Sinema, a Democrat, as his senator.\n\n“That's going to be the first time that I voted within the state of Arizona,” he said. “The reason I stopped voting years ago is because I was just tired of the bulls - - t.\"\n\nRecorder Fontes backs automatic voter registration\n\nFontes said sometimes voters believe they registered but haven’t, or they are certain they have updated their address or voted in a recent election, which triggers a voter-registration update after a move, but they haven’t.\n\nFontes faced a backlash in the primary election when voters showed up during the primary election to find their polling sites were closed.\n\nFontes said he modernized voting systems and increased the number of voting centers where any registered voter, regardless of where they live, can cast a ballot. Voters who have moved can also provide documents — like a current utility bill — and ID to show their new address and update their registration at the voting centers.\n\n“Maintaining the voter rolls is a partnership between the voters and my office — that partnership exists 2.5 million times in Maricopa County,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: This election will be better, Fontes promises\n\nFontes said some critical improvements that would limit voter purges in Maricopa County are in the state Legislature's hands, not his.\n\n“Let’s be honest, we’ve got no-fly lists … we’ve got all kinds of other ways to tell who people are and where people are born,\" he said, \"and yet when it comes to elections, somehow we want to ignore all that, not use all that technology, to make sure that every single eligible citizen can vote easily.”\n\nIf Fontes had his way, Arizona would adopt automatic voter registration.\n\nAutomatic voter registration is often operated through a state’s motor-vehicles department. When a citizen obtains or renews a license, the agency automatically checks if the person is eligible and registered to vote. If the individual is eligible but unregistered, that information is sent to elections officials who register the person to vote.\n\n“It makes sense not only from a policy and safety consideration, but from an economic perspective,\" he said. \"Let’s not forget I’ve had to employ over 40 temporary employees to work six days a week, 12-hour days to process all the paper that comes through this office.\"\n\nStudy: Arizona ranks among toughest states to vote\n\nArizona is the 15th most difficult state in which to vote, according to a recent Northern Illinois University study.\n\n“In recent years, American state legislatures have been busy changing state laws to either make it more difficult or easier to cast a vote on Election Day,” the study said.\n\nOregon was the easiest state in which to cast a ballot.\n\nStates where it is easiest have automatic voter registration and same-day voter registration, according to the study. Michael Pomante, a lead researcher with the study, said that by 2020, 13 states will have automatic voter registration in place.\n\nThe system has come under fire in California where Department of Motor Vehicles officials have acknowledged more than 100,000 errors, including incorrect changes to party preferences or mail-in ballot options, according to a Calmatters report, which attributes the problems to an outdated computer system. In Oregon, though, registration rates quadrupled after automatic voter policies, according to a 2018 Brennan Center report.\n\nREAD MORE: How to take time off to vote — and still get paid\n\nMississippi was the hardest state to vote in.\n\nPomante said he’s not surprised that the highest rate of voter purges in Maricopa County happened in areas with the highest rate of minorities.\n\n“It’s more difficult on average to vote in the state of Arizona than the rest of the country,” he said.\n\nHis study found a strong correlation between the difficulty in voting and the percentage of non-whites.\n\n“States that have higher rates of minority populations ... are more likely to have polices that make voting more difficult for everyone to vote,” he said.\n\nPomante said many states have adopted policies targeting certain voters.\n\n“We know that Democrats and African-Americans are more likely to take advantage of early-voting days,” he said, “and over the past years, we’ve seen states reduce the amount of early-voting days or specifically the weekend before elections because this is when African-Americans are likely to vote.”\n\nREAD MORE: Volunteers work to protect Native American voting rights\n\nHe pointed to a recent North Dakota law requiring ID with a current address and the difficulties it is creating for Native American voters. Native Americans have argued they are disenfranchised by the law because tribal members on reservations don’t have standard addresses.\n\nWhat would make it easier for Arizonans to vote?\n\nA Brennan Center report on national voter purges called out states with problematic voter removals and outlined steps that states could make to protect citizens' rights to vote.\n\n\"Voter purges are an often-flawed process of cleaning up voter rolls by deleting names from registration lists,\" the report said. \"Done badly, they can prevent eligible people from casting a ballot that counts.\"\n\nThe report warned of negative effects stemming from the U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which ended oversight known as \"preclearance\" requiring Arizona and eight other states with a history of racial discrimination to seek federal approval before enacting new voter laws.\n\nIn a 5-4 split decision, the court ruled that the formula determining which states must receive preclearance was unconstitutional and said the conditions that originally \"justified these measures no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions.\"\n\nThe decision weakened voter protections under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for minority populations, the report said.\n\n\"For the two election cycles between 2012 and 2016, jurisdictions no longer subject to federal preclearance had purge rates significantly higher than jurisdictions that did not have it in 2013,\" the report said.\n\nREAD MORE: What's up with all those billboards telling you to VOTE?\n\nThe report also noted Arizona's policy of using a system called Crosscheck to purge voters within 90 days of an election. Federal law prohibits large-scale purges during that period.\n\nFontes said the County Recorder's Office no longer uses Crosscheck.\n\n\"It’s a terrible program designed to suppress votes, and it was costing the county one full-time employee from January to October every year because the list was so inaccurate,\" Fontes said.\n\nThe voter-purge report makes the following recommendations:\n\nEnforce the NVRA protections, which federally mandates how states can manage purges, and seek legal recourse to ensure compliance with the law.\n\nMandate greater protections for voters and set purging standards greater than those required by NVRA, which sets minimum guidelines. For example, states should protect against disenfranchisement by providing public and individual notice before purging people from the rolls.\n\nEstablish automatic voter registration.\n\nEven if the general election runs smoothly Tuesday, policies that prevent citizens from voting will continue in Arizona.\n\n\"There are people who make it harder for eligible citizens to vote,” Fontes said.\n\nREAD MORE: Get free, unlimited access to azcentral on Election Day\n\nRios said he couldn't help but think of his last name and the color of his skin when his voter registration disappeared.\n\n“I really want to have the hope that it could happen to anyone,” he said. “But I do think it partly has to do with my ethnicity.\n\n\"I feel like as we’ve seen many times, history has repeated itself right now. Minorities are being targeted when it comes to voting because right now people in power don’t want them voting. It's that minorities tend to vote Democrat instead of Republican.”\n\nZIP codes with the 5 highest purge rates\n\n85281, Tempe: 11.5 purges per 100 active voters, 53% white, 39% poverty rate\n\n85034, Phoenix: 10.5 purges per 100 active voters, 14% white, 48% poverty rate\n\n85007, Phoenix: 9.7 purges per 100 active voters, 27% white, 40% poverty rate\n\n85008, Phoenix: 8.3 purges per 100 active voters, 25% white, 32% poverty rate\n\n85139, southwestern Maricopa County: 7.4 purges per 100 active voters, 48% white, 15% poverty rate\n\nZIP codes with the 5 lowest purge rates\n\n85298, Gilbert: 1.4 purges per 100 active voters, 77% white, 6% poverty rate\n\n85355, Waddell: 1.8 purges per 100 active voters, 69% white, 6% poverty rate\n\n85383, Peoria: 1.8 purges per 100 active voters, 79% white, 3% poverty rate\n\n85263, northeast of Valley: 2 purges per 100 active voters, 96% white, 1% poverty rate\n\n85387, Sun City: 2.2 purges per 100 active voters, 79% white, 2% poverty rate\n\nVOTING PROBLEMS?\n\nWe’re part of ProPublica's Electionland project, a collaboration of newsrooms across the country tracking voting problems on Election Day.

That election marked the first time a Democratic presidential campaign had carried the Copper State since 1948.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n“That’s a turnaround,” Biden said in remarks early Wednesday of Arizona.\n\nIn Arizona's Senate race, Capt. Mark Kelly, husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeated Sen. Martha McSally to pick up another seat for Democrats.\n\nThe result was a momentum boost for Biden: It represents the first state he flipped from 2016 and the projection came at a time when he has been running behind Trump in several battleground states in early returns – especially in states that have not yet tallied outstanding mail ballots that are ultimately expected to benefit Democrats.\n\nTaking Arizona widens Biden’s path to the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to capture the presidency.\n\nThe win for Kelly was critical for Democrats to gain control of the Senate. But Kelly was one of only two pick-ups for Democrats on a night when they hoped for many more.\n\nDemocratic losses in Senate races in North Carolina, Iowa and Montana might have ruined their chances to take control from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcSally, a firebrand conservative aligned with Trump, lost narrowly to Democrat Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in 2018. She was later appointed to fill the seat left after the death of Sen. John McCain. The race between McSally and Kelly is a special election to complete that term.\n\nThe key swing county of Arizona, Maricopa – which includes Phoenix and its suburbs – narrowly went for Trump in 2016. The rest of the state followed, along with its 11 Electoral College votes. This time around, early returns showed Biden with a wide margin in absentee votes.\n\nThere have been signs for years that Arizona, home to the late Sen. John McCain, a Republican, was losing its status as a GOP stronghold and becoming a battleground. Like other Sunbelt states, Arizona has become a destination for people from other parts of the country. It also has a growing, Democrat-leaning Latino population.\n\nBiden’s win in Arizona may speak to a national trend about the Democrat’s appeal to Hispanic voters. There were signs Biden underperformed with Hispanics in Florida – particularly in and around Miami – and the results in Arizona may represent a counter to that narrative.\n\nThe initial projection from Fox News drew criticism from Trump campaign aide Jason Miller, who said he believed a large share of outstanding Election Day votes would go for Trump. “Way too soon,” Miller tweeted.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nBiden wins Maine, a possibly divided state\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden won Maine, holding at least three of the state’s four electoral college votes, as President Donald Trump sought to win its northern congressional district.\n\nMaine is one of two states, along with Nebraska, that divides its electoral college votes. Nebraska’s second congressional district supported Biden, while the rest of the state supported Trump.\n\nTrump campaigned in Bangor and invited a lobsterman to the Republican National Convention. Trump promoted his reopening a stretch of the Atlantic Ocean off New England to lobster fishing, after the area had been closed under the Obama administration while Biden was vice president.\n\nBut Maine has supported Democratic presidential candidates since 1992. Biden enjoyed support for his proposals to strengthen requirements for the federal government to buy products manufactured in America.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump says he's won election though votes are still being counted\n\nPresident Donald Trump touted his wins in Florida and Texas during early morning remarks at the White House on Wednesday and claimed without evidence that a “very sad group of people” was trying to disenfranchise his supporters.\n\nWhile neither candidate has reached the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, and votes were still being counted in several key battleground states. But Trump nevertheless suggested – falsely – that he had already won.\n\n“Frankly, we did this win election,” Trump said told supporters in the East Room of the White House. “As far as I’m concerned, we have already have won.”\n\nIn fact, millions of mail ballots were still being counted in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia.\n\nTrump pointed to his early lead in Pennsylvania and suggested it would be “almost impossible” for Democrats to catch up there and several other states. In fact, hundreds of thousands of votes have not yet been counted in the state and the counting of ballots continues there and other states.\n\nThe White House hosted a watch party throughout the evening that was still well underway Wednesday morning. Guests mingled in the East Room, munching on hamburgers while following the returns on large-screen televisions. Two large TVs had been set up in the corners of the historic room -- between them an array of American flags.\n\nTrump’s remarks came hours after Biden thanked supporters and said he was confident of victory against Trump based on his early lead in Arizona and the so-called “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where ballots were still being counted.\n\n“Keep the faith, guys,” Biden told a cheering crowd in Delaware. “We’re going to win this.”\n\nHe told the crowd their patience was commendable. But he noted it was well known before voting began Tuesday it would take time to count the huge number of early mail ballots.\n\n“We’re going to have to be patient,” Biden said. “It ain’t over until every vote is counted.”\n\n-- David Jackson, John Fritze and Bart Jansen\n\n— David Jackson, John Fritze and Bart Jansen\n\nGOP gets another big Senate win\n\nRepublican Sen. Steve Daines fended off a tough Democratic challenge from outgoing Gov. Steve Bullock, another stinging defeat for Democrats seeking to gain a majority in the Senate.\n\nThe loss further worsens Democratic chances of taking control of the Senate majority after Republicans fended off challenges in a number of key battleground states.\n\nMontana was viewed as an uphill battle for Democrats as Trump won the state by more than 20 percentage points in 2016 and Daines had frequently polled ahead throughout the campaign.\n\nBut Bullock was a star recruit for Democrats, a two-term governor known for being a centrist after he bowed out of the 2020 Democratic primary.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\n2020 election sees massive turnout\n\nAbout two-thirds of all counties in the United States have reported more votes counted so far in 2020 than were cast in 2016, as of 1 a.m. eastern time on election night.\n\nThe number of people voting has now exceeded 2016’s total in more than 2,000 of the nation’s counties in 48 states, which ran the gamut from rural to suburban and urban.\n\nThe most dramatic increases came both in places that voted heavily for Trump in 2016 and those with the country’s whitest populations, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data compiled by the Associated Press.\n\nTo be sure, the trend only reflects partial vote counts and could shift as more ballots are tabulated in Hillary Clinton strongholds and majority-nonwhite counties. But if it holds, the data suggest the big surge in participation may cut in Trump’s favor.\n\nIn Union County, Tenn., just outside Knoxville – where only 3.5% of the population identifies as something other than white – 6,247 votes were cast four years ago. This year, voters cast more than 8,000 votes, up 29%.\n\nThat enthusiasm did not carry through to heavily nonwhite counties. About 50% of the nation’s counties with the highest proportion of people of color exceeded their 2016 vote total as of late Tuesday night, compared with 75% of counties with the whitest populations.\n\nThe same gap appeared in the counties that most strongly supported Clinton’s 2016 presidential run.\n\nMore than 83% of the strongest Trump-supporting counties have counted more votes so far than votes cast in 2016, while so far only 42% of Clinton’s best-performing counties have exceeded their vote total from the last presidential election.\n\n— Matt Wynn\n\nGOP Congressman tells Trump to ‘stop’ and have ‘patience’ as votes are counted\n\nRepublican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Air Force veteran who frequently calls out the president’s conduct, told Trump to stop tweeting false claims about the election and to have patience.\n\nThe president took to Twitter to complain about votes that were still being counted in a number of states, claiming without evidence that “they are trying to STEAL the Election.” Many races across the country aren’t expected to be called tonight due to the surge in absentee and mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. But there is no evidence to back up the president’s assertions and Twitter labeled the post as possibly misleading and having information that is disputed.\n\n“Stop. Full stop.The votes will be counted and you will either win or lose,” Kinzinger responded on Twitter. “And America will accept that. Patience is a virtue.”\n\nKinzinger has bashed Trump on a host of issues, including saying a threat from the president that his impeachment could lead to a civil war was “beyond repugnant.”\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nBiden wins Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District\n\nBiden flipped Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District, a pickup of a single electoral college vote in a state that is otherwise reliably Republican. The win gives Biden 224 electoral college votes to Trump's 213.\n\nBarack Obama carried the district in 2008 but not in 2012. Trump won it in 2016.\n\nThe mostly-urban district includes Omaha, prompting some Democrats to call it “Obamaha” after 2008. The new nickname might be “Joemaha?”\n\nWhatever it’s called, the district is now officially a swing seat for presidential races.\n\nNebraska and Maine are the only two states that don’t award all their electoral college votes to the statewide winner. Nebraska split the votes in 1991 in hopes of increasing the state’s relevance politically.\n\nIt worked. Both campaigns paid attention to the district, amid speculation from handicappers that the race could come down to the single congressional districts in Nebraska and Maine to avert a 269-269 tie.\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump wins Texas to gain ground on Biden\n\nTrump held on to Texas, despite recent Democratic gains that appeared to have put the GOP’s biggest electoral prize in jeopardy.\n\nOnly reliably-blue California has more electoral college votes than Texas. That gives Biden 223 electoral college votes and Trump 212 after 1 a.m. EDT. Either candidate will need 270 electoral college votes to win the election.\n\nTexans have voted for the GOP nominee for president for the past 40 years. But the state has been trending away from Republicans and Democrats made advancements in 2018, particularly in the major city suburbs.\n\nCompeting in Texas is costly, one reason why Biden didn’t make more of a push. It was also clear that if Trump lost Texas, he’d be losing many other, more competitive, places.\n\nThe campaign did send Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Friday in an 11-hour push.\n\nEarly voting had been off the charts, with the number of ballots cast exceeding the total vote of 2016 days before the polls closed.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump, Biden confident as election zeros in on battleground states\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden thanked his supporters at an early Wednesday rally saying he was confident of victory against President Donald Trump based on support in Arizona and the so-called “blue wall” of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.\n\n“Keep the faith, guys,” Biden told a cheering crowd honking car horns outside Chase Center on the Riverfront. “We’re going to win this.”\n\nHe told the crowd their patience was commendable. But he said it was well known before voting ended Tuesday that it would take a while to count record early voting by mail.\n\n“We’re going to have to be patient,” Biden said. “It ain’t over until every vote is counted, ballot is counted.”\n\nHe cited promising results in Arizona, which Trump won in 2016, and holding Minnesota, a traditionally Democratic state where Trump campaigned heavily.\n\n“We’re still in the game in Georgia, although that’s not what we expected,” Biden said. “We’re feeling real good about Wisconsin and Michigan. And by the way, it’s going to take time to count votes, but we’re going to win Pennsylvania.”\n\nTrump said early Wednesday he will make a statement later in the morning about a \"big win\" in the presidential election, but he hasn't won anything yet: Too many states are still counting votes.\n\n\"We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election,\" Trump tweeted. \" We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Poles are closed!\"\n\nNo state is trying to steal anything; states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia still counting votes.\n\nTrump's claim came after Democratic challenger Joe Biden said he feels he's \"on track\" to win the election because of support from mail-in votes, and he urged supporters to exercise patience while states count ballots.\n\n\"We feel good about where we are,\" Biden said. \"We really do.\"\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump protested the very idea of counting ballots after Election Day, and suggested possible legal action.\n\nOfficials in still-contested states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin said the need time to count the many absentee and mail-in votes produced this election because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– David Jackson, Bart Jansen\n\nTrump wins Florida, a vital battleground state\n\nPresident Donald Trump safely held Florida, a key battleground which was nearly a requirement for him to beat Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nFlorida was the most populous of six major contested states in the campaign, with 29 electoral college votes toward the 270 needed to win the presidency. Political experts said if Biden seized it from Republicans, Trump would have little chance of staying in the White House.\n\nFlorida has see-sawed between Republicans and Democrats while supporting whoever won the White House for the last 24 years. The Tampa, Orlando and Miami television markets were tops for both candidates.\n\nBoth candidates campaigned in Florida repeatedly. Biden and his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, focused on older voters, veterans and Hispanics. But polling suggested Biden wasn’t receiving as much support from Hispanics, a crucial voting bloc, as Democrat Hillary Clinton had in 2016.\n\nTrump, who changed his residency to Florida from New York during the presidency, campaigned on reducing taxes and supporting the military.\n\n“Two days from now, we’re going to win my home state of Florida and we’re going to win four more years in the White House,” Trump told a rally in Opa-locka on Sunday. “With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase: ‘Made in the USA.’”\n\nBiden had told reporters Tuesday that if he won Florida, the race was over. But if not, he would look to the so-called “blue wall” of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which combined could determine who wins the White House.\n\n“If Florida came in by 1, it’s over. Done,” Biden said. “If Florida doesn’t come in and what happens is the early vote occurs in some other states, I think we’re going to do well in them and we’re going to reestablish that ‘blue wall.’ I feel good about that.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden wins Minnesota\n\nMinnesota will stay blue.\n\nThe AP has called the state for Joe Biden, despite Donald Trump’s attempts to put the state’s 10 electoral votes in the red column.\n\nDemocrats have carried the state since 1972. But the 2016 election changed the calculus for both Republicans and Democrats. Trump lost Minnesota by just 44,593 votes, or a margin of less than 2% of the vote, and vowed to try to flip the state in this election.\n\nBoth Biden and Trump campaigned in the North Star State in the closing weeks of the campaign.\n\n— Michael Collins\n\nTrump takes must-win Ohio\n\nTrump won Ohio (and its 18 electoral votes), according to projections from Fox News and NBC News, in what many saw as a must-win for the president.\n\nBiden had hoped to do better than Clinton four years ago, who lost the Buckeye State by about 8 percentage points. Polls had shown Biden up for weeks in the fall, but that lead had evaporated as the election drew near.\n\nThe former vice president made an unplanned visit to the Buckeye State Monday, sensing the state was winnable heading into Election Day.\n\nBut with 94% of the vote counted, Trump had gotten nearly 3 million votes compared to the 2.5 million for Biden – or a difference of about 8 points.\n\nTrump has made a personal pitch to the state, stressing his support for manufacturing jobs and trade deals he believes will benefit a state that has picked every winner since Lyndon Johnson in 1964.\n\nHe had visited the state three times since late September, including the first debate with Biden in Cleveland.\n\nTrump won the Buckeye State despite picking a fight with one of its most prominent employers. In August, the president called on his supporters to not \"buy Goodyear Tires\" after reports that the company's zero-tolerance policy doesn't allow employees to wear MAGA hats and other politically affiliated slogans or material.\n\nIn addition, former GOP Gov. John Kasich endorsed Biden over Trump.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden expected to speak\n\nJoe Biden, who has been watching election returns from his Delaware home, was expected to comment on the returns around 12:30 a.m.\n\nBiden had said Tuesday afternoon that he wouldn’t necessarily make remarks.\n\n\"If there's something to talk about tonight I'll talk about it,” he told reporters. “If not, I'll wait until the votes have been counted the next day.\"\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump wins Texas as race tightens\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden secured one electoral vote from Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. The state’s other four electoral votes have been called for President Donald Trump. Nebraska and Maine are the only two states that don’t award all their electoral college votes to the statewide winner.\n\nTrump had already secured Texas, Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Louisiana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas.\n\nBiden earlier won Minnesota, Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, New Hampshire, Colorado, the District of Columbia, New Mexico, New York, Virginia, Vermont, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, Delaware and Connecticut.\n\nThat gives Biden 224 electoral college votes and Trump 213 after 1:30 a.m. EDT. Either candidate will need 270 electoral college votes to win the election.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann, Jeanine Santucci\n\nBattleground states up for grabs\n\nA number of battleground states are still on the table as of 12:30 a.m. EDT, but a few crucial ones have been called for both candidates.\n\nOhio went to the president, a crucial state for his path to reelection, as well as Iowa.\n\nBiden was able to keep the state of Minnesota in the blue column.\n\nFlorida has been the state very closely watched since the beginning, as it has been too close to call with Biden slightly trailing Trump, largely due to a poor turnout in the Miami-Dade county for Democrats.\n\nIn Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina, typically red states that the Biden campaign hoped to swing to the blue column this year, the former Vice President has been almost neck-in-neck with Trump, but slightly behind, with all of them too close to call.\n\nHowever, in Georgia, a few blue counties have stopped counting ballots for the night. One of those, Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, a pipe bursting earlier today at State Farm Arena will delay the counting of absentee ballots.\n\nBiden is slightly leading in Arizona, another typically Republican state that Democrats have hoped to flip this year.\n\nResults in three of the most crucial battleground states, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, are unlikely to be known tonight. They are reporting election day votes earliest, and absentee votes latest.\n\n— Savannah Behrmann\n\nCollins concedes to Loeffler in Georgia\n\nRepublican Rep. Doug Collins has conceded to Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia's special election.\n\nResults are still coming in for the race. A candidate must reach a 50% threshold or the race goes to a runoff in January.\n\n\"I just called @kloeffler and congratulated her on making the runoff,\" Collins wrote on Twitter. \"She has my support and endorsement. I look forward to all Republicans coming together. Raphael Warnock would be a disaster for Georgia and America.\"\n\nCollins and Loeffler were just two of six candidates running in the race.\n\nDemocrat Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, during remarks Tuesday called on voters to continue to support him in a runoff.\n\n\"Thank you for pushing me one step closer to the Senate,\" he said. \"Because when I get there, you will go with me. Your concerns will go with me. Your issues will go with me.\n\n\"But I need you to keep it up for about 62 more days can we hang in there for about 62 more days,\" he continued. \"So let's stick together.\"\n\nNew Hampshire goes for Biden\n\nJoe Biden was projected to win New Hampshire, capturing a state that some had considered competitive earlier in the year and where President Donald Trump campaigned in as recently as last month.\n\nNBC and CBS called the state for Biden.\n\nNew Hampshire, with four electoral votes, was considered a potential battleground earlier this year – and it was a place where some Republicans hoped to expand the map for Trump. But polling throughout the fall consistently put Biden ahead in the Granite State by double digits.\n\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton narrowly won the state in 2016, drawing votes from Manchester, Concord and Dover while Trump ran up the score in central and northern counties.\n\nThe president campaigned in Manchester, N.H., on Oct. 25, drawing a large crowd to the city’s airport for an outdoor rally.\n\nTrump has held a special relationship with New Hampshire since he won the state in the 2016 GOP primary after losing Iowa to Ted Cruz days earlier.\n\n—John Fritze\n\nVoter turnout in Florida exceeds 2016 levels\n\nVoter turnout surpassed 2016 levels in the battleground state of Florida, where President Donald Trump has been leading former Vice President Joe Biden in the early vote tallies.\n\nAll eyes are on Florida tonight with its 29 electoral votes that could make or break the election for either candidate. The race so far has not been called, but Trump is favored to win.\n\nAt least 61.9% of Florida’s voting-age population has voted in this year’s presidential election, compared to 56.9% that cast ballots four years ago, according to a USA TODAY data analysis.\n\nNinety-one percent of votes were counted as of 9:45 p.m. Eastern. That’s 10.9 million ballots out of a voting-age population of 17.5 million. In 2016, the state tallied 9.4 million ballots out of a voting-age population of 16.6 million.\n\nUSA TODAY’s analysis looks at Associated Press data on votes counted and an estimate of the voting-age population from the U.S. Elections Project.\n\nBesides Florida, only three other states so far have surpassed its 2016 voter turnout – Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nWith 93% percent of its ballots counted, 57.4% of residents who are of voting age turned out in the Bluegrass State this year compared to 56.1% in 2016. In North Carolina, 60.5% of voters cast ballots compared to 60.2% four years ago. And in Kentucky it was 48.8% compared to 48.6% in the last election. Both states have counted more than 84% of its votes.\n\nTrump was called the winner in Kentucky and Tennessee and is expected to win North Carolina.\n\n— Erin Mansfield, Dian Zhang\n\nGOP gets Senate win in Alabama\n\nSenate Republicans scored an expected victory in ruby-red Alabama, where GOP contender Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach, defeated Democrat Doug Jones.\n\nJones won this seat in a 2017 special election against Republican Roy Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Moore was dogged by allegations that he pursued sexual relationships with four teenage girls when he was in his early 30s.\n\nThe Alabama contest was long seen as a bright spot for Republicans as they seek to keep control of the Senate.\n\nGraham, Cornyn keep GOP Senate seats\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham defeated Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison in the South Carolina U.S. Senate race, surviving the political fight of his life and securing a fourth term.\n\nThe Associated Press projected Graham beat Harrison, a former chairman of the state's Democratic Party who raised record-setting money from Democrats nationally.\n\nAlthough South Carolina is reliably red, Harrison made the contest competitive, capitalizing on the left’s deep desire coast-to-coast to unseat Graham. The incumbent senator became one of Trump's most loyal soldiers in the Senate despite regularly criticizing Trump during the 2016 presidential primary.\n\nBut the seat was always seen as an uphill fight for Democrats and not a key pick up or Democrats to gain control of the Senate.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. John Cornyn fended off a tough challenge to keep his Senate seat from Democrat MJ Hegar, according to ABC and NBC, diminishing Democratic hopes for a blue wave in Texas.\n\nCornyn’s seat was rated as leaning Republican and Democrats acknowledged the uphill battle in winning in Texas, a monster state with 38 electoral votes. The state hasn't been blue since 1976 with Jimmy Carter at the presidential level and Democrats haven't held a Senate seat since 1993 with Sen. Bob Krueger, who was appointed to the seat.\n\nThe win shrinks the routes for Democrats in taking the Senate majority and shifts the focus to a number of other battleground states, including Arizona, Maine, Iowa and North Carolina, in order to keep aspirations alive for liberals eager to take the chamber.\n\nColorado gives Democrats first Senate pick up of the night\n\nThe first Democratic pick up of the night came in Colorado, where John Hickenlooper, the state’s former governor, defeated Republican incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner, according to NBC and Fox.\n\nColorado has shifted in Democrats favor since Gardner was first elected in 2014. He only won that race by a 1.9% margin, and he was seen as one of the most vulnerable Senate Republicans in this election cycle. Trump’s unpopularity in the state served as an anchor on Gardner as he fought for a second term; he consistently lagged Hickenlooper in the polls and in fundraising.\n\nArizona, other western states wrap up voting\n\nAnother slew of states finished voting at 9 p.m. ET, including the pivotal battleground of Arizona, as ballot counting continued in a handful of other states that will ultimately decide the presidential election.\n\nArizona, Colorado and parts of Michigan that had not already closed ballot boxes shut down their voting locations and began tallying results.\n\nDemocrat Joe Biden held early leads in several of the most closely watched battlegrounds, including North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Trump got off to a narrow, early lead in Florida. But given the huge share of Americans who voted early due to the coronavirus pandemic, experts cautioned against reading much of anything into the earliest results.\n\nObservers in both campaigns were closely watching the key Arizona swing county of Maricopa – which includes Phoenix and its suburbs. That county narrowly went for Trump in 2016, and so did the state – with its 11 electoral votes.\n\nTrump and Biden each picked up early and predictable state calls, with Trump projected to win Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama –among others -- and Biden quickly locking down a slew of reliably blue states in the Northeast, including his home state of Delaware, but also Massachusetts and New Jersey.\n\nBut the country was still hours away – at best – from even beginning to assess the outcome in states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona that will decide the contest.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nA look at the voting surge\n\nVoter turnout surged nationwide this year, with the number of ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election surpassing the 2016 tally in at least 196 counties across eight states as of 8:40 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nIn Florida, a battleground state where the race has not yet been called, 50 of 64 counties reporting have seen higher turnout this year than in the previous presidential election four years ago, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from The Associated Press.\n\nIn Kentucky, where Trump is the projected winner, 54 of 85 counties reporting had higher voter turnout. In red-leaning Indiana, 33 of 63 reporting counties have surpassed 2016 levels. Twenty-three of 126 counties reporting in Virginia, where Biden is expected to prevail, surpassed their 2016 totals.\n\nHere is the situation with high turnout in four other states:\n\n19 of 97 reporting counties in Georgia\n\n15 of 35 reporting counties in Texas\n\n1 of 42 reporting counties in Tennessee\n\n1 of 2 reporting counties in New Jersey\n\nThe numbers reflect the turnout for each county. They do not include other states that are reporting high turnout, such as Texas, where, even before Election Day, early votes in 2020 surpassed all votes cast in 2016. Rhode Island is also reporting higher voter turnout than its previous records set in 2008.\n\nJoshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky, said turnout is high nationwide because President Donald Trump has inspired people to vote for him and against him.\n\n“The second reason is that in most places we made it easier to vote, and what we know is that if we enact pro-voter reforms that make it easier to vote, voters show up,” Douglas said.\n\nOnly five states — Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas — did not allow voters to use the coronavirus pandemic as a reason to vote by mail. Some states, such as Vermont, mailed absentee ballots to every active voter without requiring an application.\n\n— Erin Mansfield and Matt Wynn\n\nPresident Donald Trump tries to hold onto Trump States in the South\n\nDonald Trump's people still felt good about things as of 8 p.m., but acknowledge they are struggling to hold early reporting states essential to their victory strategy: Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina.\n\nThose are all states Trump carried four years ago, and losing any one of them would likely make it impossible for Trump to prevail given his challenges in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, officials said.\n\nCampaign officials said they are focusing now on Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. Secure those states first, they said, and then they'll worry about places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Texas, and Arizona.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nMcConnell gets re-elected\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cinched to re-election in Kentucky, despite facing a fierce and well-funded challenge from Democrat Amy McGrath, a fighter pilot who Democrats hoped would unseat the longtime GOP leader.\n\nTrump takes South Carolina\n\nThe Republican nominee on Tuesday was awarded its nine electoral votes.\n\nTrump handily won the state in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton. South Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976.\n\nJoe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina primary in February started a wave of wins that helped cement his status as Democrats’ presidential nominee. South Carolina Republicans didn’t hold a primary, an early sign of their support for Trump’s reelection.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nVirginias split between Trump, Biden\n\nWest Virginia, a reliably Republican state that has not backed a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996, has been placed in President Donald Trump's column, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe state, where nearly 68% of voters backed Trump in 2016, has five electoral votes. Trump last traveled to the state in 2019 for a fundraiser. He held a rally there ahead of the midterm elections in 2018.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden has won the state of Virginia, which has shifted more liberal in recent years. He adds 13 electoral votes to his tally.\n\n— John Fritze, Jeanine Santucci\n\nSurvey: 1 in 3 voters ‘not confident’ ballots will be counted fairly\n\nOnly about two-thirds of voters are confident that ballots will be counted fairly, while nearly one-third are “not too confident” or “not at all confident,” according to a major survey by The Associated Press.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has railed repeatedly against the illegitimacy of mail-in voting, despite voting absentee himself in Florida. But officials from both parties encouraged absentee voting for anyone concerned about lines or health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nElection experts say there is little evidence of fraud in voting because of security measures governing how absentee ballots are submitted and reviewed. But concerns linger among voters after Trump repeatedly highlighted the potential for fraud.\n\nAbout one in four voters are “very confident” their ballot will be counted fairly and 44% are “somewhat confident,” according to the AP VoteCast survey of voters for this election.\n\nBut about one in four voters are “not too confident their ballot will be counted fairly and 7% are “not at all confident,” according to the survey.\n\nWhen the terms were changed slightly, about one in four voters described themselves as “very confident” that their votes will be counted accurately, while about three in four are “less confident,” according to the survey.\n\nAbout three in four voters said racism is a “very” or “somewhat serious” problem in U.S. society, compared to more than one in five that say it is “not too serious” or “not at all,” according to the survey.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nKentucky, Vermont, Indiana among first calls\n\nThere is always drama on election night. But not all states can deliver it.\n\nKentucky, Vermont and Indiana were among the first states called for President Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden, just minutes after their polls closed.\n\nVermont, among the most liberal states in the nation, predictably went to Biden, according to the Associated Press. By contrast, deeply red Kentucky was called almost immediately for Trump, according to the AP.\n\nTwo networks -- CNN and NBC -- called Indiana for Trump.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nAP survey: Voters seek ‘major changes’ in criminal justice\n\nAfter racial justice protests roiled the country this year, two-thirds of voters think the criminal justice system needs a “complete overhaul” or “major changes,” according to a major survey of voters by The Associated Press.\n\nThe death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 sparked protests nationwide, which spread after other confrontations with police from coast to coast.\n\nPresident Donald Trump campaigned as the law-and-order president, supporting police as protests occasionally turned violent with arson, burglaries and shootings. Federal authorities cleared a path June 1 with batons and tear gas for Trump to walk from the White House to a nearby church to hold a Bible aloft.\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden supported peaceful protests while denouncing violence. He urged greater training for police to calm tense confrontations, while dismissing proposals from more progressive supporters to defund police.\n\nThe AP VoteCast survey of voters in the election that ended Tuesday found about one in four think there should be a “complete overhaul” of the criminal justice system and nearly half think there should be “major changes.” Another one in four think there should be “minor changes.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nCOVID, economy and racial injustice top issues for voters, exit polls show\n\nEarly exit polls both nationally and in key battleground states show voters casting their ballots today have rated the COVID-19 pandemic, economy and racial injustice are among the issues most important to them, according to exit polls from NBC, CNN and the Morning Consult.\n\nThe exit polls, while a helpful examination of voter mindset, are a little different this year as millions of voters cast their ballots via absentee and by mail and news outlets cautioned these polls could not be as indicative of the electorate as previous years.\n\nNBC's early exit polls show that 34% of voters nationwide rated the economy as the issue that mattered most to their vote, followed by racial inequality with 21%, the coronavirus pandemic at 18% and tied for fourth at 11%, health care and crime and safety.\n\nExit polls conducted by the Morning Consult asked Biden and Trump voters what were the leading issues that motivated them, finding 93% of Biden supporters rated controlling COVID-19 spread as very important, compared to 59% of Trump voters.\n\nThe issue was the top for Biden supporters, followed by unifying the country and a host of healthcare issues, reducing racial inequality then climate change.\n\nThe top issue for Trump voters, the exit poll found, was protecting the U.S. from terrorism with 83% of voters rating it very important, followed by economic recovery, lowering the unemployment rate, lowering taxes and lowering healthcare costs.\n\nCNN's early exit polls similarly showed that the economy and coronavirus pandemic were top of mind.\n\nAbout one-third of voters rated the economy as the most crucial issue that loomed over their vote, followed racial inequality (1 in 5 voters) then the coronavirus pandemic (1 in 6 voters).\n\nWhile the emphasis on the economy could be good news for Trump, who has boasted about the need for states to reopen and diminished the severity of the pandemic, CNN noted that even while the economy was top of mind for voters, a majority of voters said the priority should be containing the COVID-19 pandemic over rebuilding the nation's economy.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nPandemic tops voters’ concerns\n\nThe pandemic was foremost on voters' minds, according to a survey of the electorate conducted by the Associated Press.\n\nForty-two percent said it's the most important issue facing the country, by far the highest response to the question. Twenty-seven percent picked the economy, which is related.\n\nNearly all – 95% – said the federal government's response to the pandemic was a factor in deciding how to vote. The same share said the economic downturn was also factor. That's a slightly higher share than said the same of protests over police violence (92%) or Supreme Court nominations (90%).\n\nAnd more voters disapprove of President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic than approve: 58% to 42%.\n\nBy contrast, 74% approve of how Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has addressed the pandemic. And 61% think their governor has done a good job.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nRepublican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker leaves ballot blank for presidential race\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a moderate Republican critical of President Donald Trump, passed on the presidential race altogether when he cast his ballot.\n\n“I blanked it,” Baker told reporters in Boston, according to multiple media outlets, choosing neither Trump, Democratic nominee Joe Biden nor a third-party candidate.\n\nBaker, a second-term governor, this past year slammed Trump over his response to the coronavirus pandemic and after the president called governors \"weak\" when protests over race erupted this summer.\n\nBaker refrained from voting for president in 2016, as well. But outside of his resistance to Trump, Baker has remained loyal to the Republican Party, endorsing U.S. Sen.

Arkansas closes its polls at 8:30 p.m. EST, with more closures at the top of every hour until voters in Alaska get their last chance to cast their ballots at 1 a.m. EST.\n\nAs the polls close the results will begin to roll in but the winner in many states likely won't be known on election night due to the massive increase in mailed-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, results may be known late Tuesday in two critical states: Florida and North Carolina, which both began processing mailed-in ballots before Election Day.\n\n— William Cummings\n\nPence goes on a radio and TV tour as Harris campaigns in Detroit on Election Day\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris campaigned in Detroit Tuesday afternoon as Vice President Mike Pence took to the airwaves on the last day of campaigning\n\n“The path to determining who will be the next president of the United States, without question, runs through Michigan,” Harris said in Detroit.\n\n“I'm just here to remind people in Detroit that, that they are seen and heard by Joe and me, and also that they may actually decide the outcome of this race,” she told reporters.\n\nBiden and Harris today:Biden goes to church, Scranton home on Election Day; Harris hits Detroit - live updates\n\nMichigan, which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly lost in 2016, is a top battleground in this year’s election.\n\nPence, on the other hand, did several radio and TV interviews with stations in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Florida, including local conservative talk radio and Spanish media in Florida.\n\nHitting familiar campaign themes, Pence told WISN, a Milwaukee talk radio station, “the choice is clear” and accused Biden of being “overtaken by the radical left.”\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\n'We’ve got a long day': Handful of candidates make final push for Georgia Senate seats\n\nGeorgia is hosting two hotly contested Senate races this election, making for an extra intense final push to get voters to the polls in that state.\n\nIncumbent Republican Sen. David Purdue held an election eve rally in an airport hanger outside of Atlanta, with his giant red-and-blue campaign bus serving as part of the backdrop. His Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff made two Election Day stops at polling places in Atlanta to greet voters and thank them for turning out.\n\n“VOTE. VOTE. VOTE,” Ossoff tweeted. He also urged any Georgians experiencing problems at the polls to call the state’s voter protection hotline.\n\nBut most voters reported relatively short wait times and no hiccups, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nThe second Senate race is a special election with multiple candidates. Incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, faces a challenger from her own party in Rep. Doug Collins, as well as a bevy of other contenders, including the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat and pastor.\n\nA Georgia surprise?:Will Georgia voters deliver Biden an election surprise? What we know about the tight race\n\nGeorgia Senate races:Georgia has two contested Senate races in a rare twist. Both could be headed to a runoff.\n\nWarnock held two final get-out-the-vote events on Tuesday, including one with Stacy Abrams, a rising Democratic star who narrowly lost a bid for Georgia governor in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Loeffler made her closing argument on Monday during two rallies with Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and Trump’s first Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nCollins made a similar last-minute push for votes, albeit without Haley’s star power. “We’ve got a long day,” Collins said in a video message posted on campaign's Twitter account Tuesday. “If you’ve already voted, thank you so much. If you’ve already voted for us and you took somebody with you, thank you even more.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nTrump, Biden will be home on Election Night\n\nAs the election returns pour (or dribble) in Tuesday night, President Donald Trump and former vice president Joe Biden will be where most Americans are: at home.\n\nIn Biden’s case, that means Wilmington, Delaware, the place from which he commuted to Washington, D.C., during his 36 years in the Senate.\n\nIn Trump’s case, it means the White House and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building next door – places that government ethics watchdogs say should not house political events.\n\nTrump campaign officials had planned a party at his Trump International Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House, but that would have violated District of Columbia COVID-19 limits on crowd sizes. So the event will be held at the White House with Trump’s family, staff and supporters in attendance.\n\n“We will be together,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News.\n\nThe Trump campaign’s election night “war room” will be in the adjacent government office building, two aides said, speaking on condition they not be named discussing internal planning. There, vote totals will be monitored to determine if the campaign is hitting its get-out-the-vote targets.\n\nQAnon:QAnon-linked candidates in Georgia, Colorado could make national inroads in Tuesday's election\n\nEthics groups such as Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) say Trump once again will be using government property illegally for political purposes, just as he did in August during the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe president said on \"Fox & Friends\" early Tuesday morning that he would not declare victory prematurely because “there’s no reason to play games.”\n\nBiden, in Scranton, took note of earlier reports that Trump might do just that. Because he won the tiny town of Dixville Notch, New Hampshire, early Tuesday morning, the Democratic nominee quipped, “Based on Trump’s notion, I’m going to declare victory tonight.”\n\nDeclaration or not, Biden is expected to address supporters in Wilmington. He will be accompanied vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris of California and their spouses, Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nMaine Sen. Collins: It could take a week to know state's results\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins, considered one of the most vulnerable incumbents in the Senate, said it could take a week to know the results of the election in Maine, where she is in a tight race with Democratic challenger Sara Gideon.\n\n“I hope that when people look at my record … that I’ve never missed a roll call vote. It’s over 7,400 now,” Collins said Tuesday in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.\n\nA poll released last week by Colby College in Waterville, Maine, showed Collins trailing by 4%, at 43% vs. Gideon’s 47%. A combined 7% of voters are supporting Independent candidates Lisa Savage and Max Linn.\n\nMaine Senate race:Maine's tight race between Susan Collins and Sara Gideon could tip Senate to the Democrats\n\nMaine election:How a congressional race in Maine could play a key role in the presidential election\n\nDemocrats hope to flip Collins’ seat as they seek to gain control of the Senate, where Collins has built a career as a middle-of-the-road politician and a key swing vote. Collins voted to confirm Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in 2017 but voted against confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett, earning her criticisms from both sides of the aisle.\n\n“I make a point of working across the aisle. I take the approach that I’m there representing the people of Maine, working for them and for our country … that’s what I like to do,” Collins said. “I think I’ve been very successful at that.”\n\nIf Collins wins, she’ll be next in line to be chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, one of the most consequential and powerful committee posts in the Senate.\n\nIf neither Collins nor Gideon gets 50% of the vote, a ranked-choice voting method, in which voters will rank candidates based on preference, will determine the winner.\n\n– Kristine Phillips\n\nEarly voting surpasses 100 million\n\nA record 100.2 million people voted early in the presidential election between President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden as voters head to the polls on Election Day.\n\nFigures are according to the U.S. Elections Project, which tracks early voting and mail-in ballots returns in states. The tally crossed the century-mark Tuesday morning.\n\nIt includes 35.7 million in-person early votes and 64.6 million ballots cast by mail. The number will continue to grow as more votes cast before Tuesday are publicized by states.\n\nVoter turnout 2020:Early voting tops 100 million ballots cast\n\nThe massive early voting turnout puts the U.S. on track to likely surpass 150 million voters overall for the election, which would mark the highest turnout of eligible voters by percentage in a presidential election since 1908. That year Republican William Howard Taft defeated Democrat William Jennings Bryan with 65.7% of the voting-eligible population participating.\n\nIn 2016, 47 million people – the previous early voting record – voted before Election Day in the presidential election between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Overall, 138.8 million people, 60.1% of the voter-eligible population, voted in 2016.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nElection Day for the candidates: Biden went to church. Trump went on 'Fox & Friends'\n\nHow the two presidential candidates chose to spend Election Day only served to illustrate their vast differences.\n\nJoe Biden, the Democratic nominee and former vice president, began the day at his Roman Catholic church with his wife, Jill, and two granddaughters. The visit underscored the fact that if elected, he would be just the second practicing Catholic in the White House, after John F. Kennedy.\n\nAfter holding 14 rallies in three days that wrapped up in the wee hours Tuesday, President Donald Trump phoned in to his favorite morning TV show from the White House and said he is “feeling very good” about his reelection chances.\n\nBut even while predicting victory, Trump spent part of the interview disparaging Biden, former President Barack Obama, and congressional Democrats who he said have been “mean” to him during his term in office.\n\nBiden and Harris today::Biden goes to church, Scranton home on Election Day: Biden, Harris live updates\n\nTrump and Pence today:Trump begins Election Day with 'Fox & Friends' interview: Live updates on Trump, Pence\n\nAt midday, the president was en route to his national campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, where he planned to spend about an hour speaking with staff and volunteers. That was to be his only live event of the day.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, flew to his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he stopped by his childhood home and signed the living room wall.\n\n“From this house to the White House with the grace of God,” he wrote.\n\nFor the remainder of the day, Biden planned to make a second stop in Pennsylvania, perhaps the most important state on the map, by visiting Philadelphia before heading home to Wilmington, Delaware, where he will watch the election results Tuesday night.\n\nTrump planned to conduct more media interviews by telephone in the afternoon before watching the returns come in at the White House. He told Fox & Friends that he would not declare victory prematurely because “there’s no reason to play games” as states take time counting votes, including mail-in ballots.\n\nBut the president did have a prediction: that he would win more than the 306 electoral votes he won in 2016.\n\n– Richard Wolf\n\nElection Day voting hiccups in Pennsylvania\n\nSeveral voter and polling problems were reported Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a critical swing state President Donald Trump won by just 44,000 votes in 2016 and where polls show Joe Biden has been leading.\n\nIn Philadelphia, voters in a predominantly Black precinct reported showing up at their designated polling place, only to be told they were at the wrong one. One voter, Gilbert Fuller, a 63-year-old Black man, told the York Daily Record that he showed up at his designated polling place, a recreation center, three hours before polls opened Tuesday morning. A sign at the center instructed him to vote at a nearby elementary school. He went, only to learn he was supposed to vote at the center.\n\nIn Erie County, Democratic Party Chairman Jim Wertz reported several issues at polling places, according to the York Daily Record. For example, poll workers at a polling site in Erie were unsure how to start a new voting equipment, leading to a delay in opening, while impatient voters shouted obscenities. Similar situations were reported at other polling places in the city, Wertz said.\n\nThe final week in polls:Trump eats into Biden's leads in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania\n\nBoth Trump and Biden have spent significant amounts of time in the Keystone State, which election experts and pollsters have said is critical in both candidates’ chances of winning the presidency. Biden leads in Pennsylvania by almost 4%, according to USA TODAY’s average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight.\n\nDuring a campaign stop Monday in Luzerne County, Trump, who has claimed without evidence that massive voter fraud is under way, delivered an ominous warning to the state’s Democratic governor.\n\n“We’re all watching you, governor,” Trump said of Gov. Tom Wolf. “We have a lot of friends with eyes on you.”\n\nWolf later tweeted that Pennsylvania voters “will not be intimidated.”\n\n“You can watch us count every vote and have a fair election,” Wolf said.\n\n–York Daily Record and Kristine Phillips\n\nHouse Democrats say they're set to gain seats, warn of 'Election Week\n\nHouse Democratic leaders appeared confident they would expand their majority but warned of delays in election results across the country.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Rep. Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., the chairwoman of House Democrats' campaign arm, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi declined to put a number on how many seats they might gain tonight but said they would defend the gains Democrats made in 2018 and could flip districts previously thought to be in safe Republican territory. Bustos pointed to close races in Montana, the Austin, Texas, suburbs, and in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\n\"I think we are going to see some wins in these deep red districts that over time you're going to see going from ruby red to purple to even blue,\" said Bustos, who herself represents a district won by President Donald Trump in 2016.\n\nDemocrats were ready for any \"skullduggery the president may try to introduce into this,\" Pelosi said, though Bustos warned, \"this is an Election Day that may end up looking like an Election Week.\"\n\nIndependent forecasters give Democrats the edge in the race for the House. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report predicted Democrats would gain about 10-15 seats.\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nGOP pollster: Election will come down to Florida, N.C., Ohio\n\nLongtime conservative pollster Frank Luntz said the presidency could come down to three swing states: Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. And President Donald Trump needs to win all three.\n\n“If Trump wins all three, he’s in this. If Biden wins even one of those three, it’s Biden’s presidency,” Luntz said in an interview with CNBC Tuesday.\n\nPennsylvania, where both candidates have spent a significant amount of time campaigning, could also be consequential and the results of the election could very well come down to the Keystone state, Luntz said. But because Pennsylvania doesn’t allow election officials to begin pre-processing ballots until the morning of Election Day – while other swing states have changed their rules in response to a record number of mail-in voters – results in Pennsylvania will take days to be finalized.\n\nPolls show that Biden’s lead has tightened since October, both nationally and in battleground states.\n\nAccording to USA TODAY’s average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, Biden leads by razor-thin margins in Florida, North Carolina and Ohio.\n\nLuntz has focused his polling on swing voters. These are voters who voted for Trump in 2016, but have switched to Biden in 2020 because of the president’s failure to contain the coronavirus pandemic and his combative relationship with his administration’s own medical experts. Luntz also polled swing voters who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, but have switched to Trump in 2020 because they believe the economy is improving under the president’s watch.\n\n– Kristine Phillips\n\nDemocrats up by 115k votes in Florida heading into Election Day\n\nThe Tuesday morning update from the Florida Division of Elections shows that nearly 9.1 million people voted by mail through Monday evening, or at early voting locations.\n\nThat's a voter turnout of 63% before the polls opened Tuesday. Florida's 29 electoral votes are key to a victory for both sides. Polls heading into Election Day showed Democrat Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump in the Sunshine State.\n\nDemocrats led by 115,416 ballots when the polls opened, but Republicans are expected to have a stronger Election Day turnout. How strong the GOP push is, and how independents break, will be crucial factors in the race.\n\nFlorida's voter turnout hit 75% in 2016. The record is 83% in 1992.\n\n– Zac Anderson\n\nThe final week in polls:Trump eats into Biden's leads in Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania\n\nDHS officials: Election is secure, no indication of foreign influence on early voting\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials said Tuesday there was no indication that foreign interference had compromised early voting and reaffirmed that the American election system was secure.\n\nBut acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf also called for the public's \"patience,\" indicating that mail-in ballots and other early voting tabulation could extend beyond Tuesday.\n\n\"Voters should be patient while waiting for the outcome,\" Wolf said, speaking from DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency headquarters. \"This process may require time.\"\n\nElection results:It's Election Day. Take a breath. Here's when you'll start seeing results and what to expect\n\nWhile President Donald Trump has suggested that he might declare victory before the vote is counted, Wolf said election system authority rests with the states.\n\n\"Elections are run by the states,\" Wolf said. \"We'll rely on... local election officials.\"\n\nChristopher Krebs, chief of DHS' cyber unit that monitors for possible system intrusions, said the vote is \"secure\" though he cautioned that \"we are not out of the woods yet.\"\n\nHe referred to earlier actions by Russia and Iran to obtain voter registration information in an attempt to undermine voter confidence.\n\nIran had used the information to send threatening emails to potential voters. The emails falsely represented the senders to be affiliated with the Proud Boys, a far-right group with a history of violence who were pushing for Trump's reelection.\n\nKrebs cited the incident as an example of how federal authorities have improved their capacity to detect and quickly identify foreign actors attempting to disrupt the election.\n\n– Kevin Johnson\n\nBattleground states:These are the 12 states that will determine the 2020 election\n\nFrom India, with love\n\nVice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris' supporters in her family's ancestral village in India gathered at a temple to hold special prayers aimed at boosting the Joe Biden-Harris ticket, according to a Reuters video crew who visited the area this week.\n\nHarris is the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants and she is the first Black American to be selected as a vice presidential candidate of a major party, as well as the first Indian American woman in this role.\n\nThe battle for the House:Will Democrats expand their control in the House? Here are the races and surprises to watch\n\nAccording to Reuters, a local politician in Thulasendrapuram, in India's South East, conducted an “abhishekam” in the presence of about 20 villagers. The practice involves pouring milk over a Hindu idol while religious verses are recited.\n\nA separate Hindu fringe group hundreds of miles north in Delhi, joined a priest wearing saffron robes to conduct fire rituals and chant verses aimed at helping to secure President Donald Trump’s victory, according to Reuters. Members of Hindu Sena (Hindu Army) held up pictures of Trump with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with whom he has a close political relationship.\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nThe fight for the Senate:Can Republicans hold on to the Senate majority? Here's how Democrats could win control from the GOP.\n\nThe results are in for 2 New Hampshire towns that historically vote after stroke of midnight\n\nTwo tiny New Hampshire communities that vote for president just after the stroke of midnight on Election Day have cast their ballots, with one of them marking 60 years since the tradition began.\n\nThe results in Dixville Notch, near the Canadian border, were a sweep for former Vice President Joe Biden who won the town's five votes. In Millsfield, 12 miles to the south, President Donald Trump won 16 votes to Biden's five.\n\nNormally, there would be a big food spread and a lot of media crammed into a small space to watch the voting, Tom Tillotson, town moderator in Dixville Notch, said last week. But that's no longer possible because of the coronavirus pandemic. It's also hard to observe the 60th anniversary of the tradition, which started in November 1960.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNew Hampshire:Joe Biden wins small New Hampshire town that historically votes after stroke of midnight\n\nVoting officially begins on Election Day\n\nPolls have officially opened for Election Day voting, with several East Coast states beginning voting before dawn Tuesday. Nearly 100 million votes were cast before Election Day, leading many experts to wonder how high turnout will be.\n\nThe hours of operation for polling sites vary by state and time zone. Anyone who is in line to vote by the time polls close on Tuesday has the right to vote, but it is important to make sure that your local polling place does not close earlier than the official time listed for each state.\n\nAlmost two dozen states also allow same-day voter registration, meaning that it is still possible to cast a ballot on Election Day even if you have not previously registered to vote.\n\n– Matthew Brown\n\nElection Day voting:Here's when the voting polls open and close in every state\n\nCandidates return home after final blitz of campaign rallies\n\nPresident Donald Trump president returned to Washington around 2:30 a.m. EST on Election Day following a final blitz of campaign rallies in four states on Monday.\n\nTrump declared he would win Michigan \"so easily\" as he wrapped up a midnight gathering in Grand Rapids. Vice President Mike Pence also attended the rally.\n\nTrump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden spent his last final night of campaigning in western Pennsylvania. Speaking at a drive-in rally in Pittsburgh, Biden said: “I have a feeling we’re coming together for a big win tomorrow!”\n\nHis running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, signed off for the night just after midnight EST on Twitter, urging voters to get a good night’s sleep.\n\n“Take a breath,” she said. “We got this.”\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nFor Iran, Election Day means mock the vote\n\nIran’s supreme leader became the first major international voice Tuesday to weigh in on Election Day. In a televised address, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei mocked the presidential vote and repeated baseless claims pushed by President Donald Trump about voter fraud.\n\n“If you look at their own situation, it’s lovely to watch. The incumbent president, who is supposed to hold the elections, says this is the most-rigged U.S. election throughout history,” Khamenei said, failing to note that individual states run the vote.\n\nKhamenei criticized the vote as Tehran marked an anniversary of the 1979 U.S. Embassy hostage crisis that saw 52 American diplomats and citizens held hostage for 444 days.\n\nHis claim that Iran is indifferent as to who wins the U.S. vote comes after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crushed Iran's economy, prevented it from openly selling its crude oil abroad and led to shortages of consumer goods and essential medicines.\n\n'Clear but unspoken preference':As America votes, the world watches with bated breath\n\nFormer Vice President Biden has said he would consider re-joining the 2015 nuclear deal that was negotiated by the administration he served in under former President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile Khamenei insisted the U.S. vote \"was none of our business\" he also appeared to revel in the anxiety the election has caused amid concerns the outcome could spark social discord, especially if either side attempts to declare victory before results are fully tabulated.\n\n“Such an empire will not last long. It’s obvious that when a regime reaches this point, it will not live for much longer and will be destroyed,” Khamenei said, referring to the U.S. “Of course, some of them if they take office will destroy America sooner, and some others if elected will cause America to be destroyed a bit later.”\n\n– Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nIt's Election Day in America.\n\nMore than 97 million Americans have voted nationwide before voters even began to head to the polls today, according to numbers compiled by @electproject. This represents more than 45% of registered voters nationwide.\n\nTwenty-two states, plus the District of Columbia, offer same-day voter registration. Some of those include swing states of Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nVoters who are in line by the time the polls close on Tuesday are entitled to vote, however. Local polling places may close earlier than what is listed below for respective states.\n\nMore:Here's when the voting polls open and close in every state\n\nPresident Donald Trump's and Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaigns held some of their last events last night, pitching themselves to voters with just hours left in the 2020 election.\n\nBoth campaigns found themselves focusing their efforts on key swing states – Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania among them – in the final day of the campaign. The contests could determine the outcome of the presidential election.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama stumped for Biden in Miami, Florida, to rally Latino voters in the critical battleground state after some data suggests Democrats lacking with the demographic there.\n\nElection 2020: All eyes will be on these 6 states on Election Day. Here's what we know.\n\nVoting updates:\n\nWe may not know who won the presidential election tonight. That does not necessarily mean anything is broken, fraudulent, corrupted or wrong. The AP explains.\n\nA federal judge said Monday that he will not invalidate almost 127,000 votes cast in drive-thru lanes in Texas' Harris County, the county that includes Houston and is the largest in Texas by population.\n\nBiden's lead in USA TODAY's average of averages, which is based on data from RealClearPolitics and FiveThirtyEight, reached double-digits on Oct. 12, but has since fallen back to a 7.5-percentage point lead.\n\nThe presidential election isn't the only critical race happening today. Here are the races to watch as Democrats and Republicans battle across the country over control of the Senate.\n\nWhere are the candidates today?\n\nBiden will travel to Scranton and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Tuesday.

The same article was shared to Facebook on Dec. 3 by Trump.\n\nThe article's headline reads, \"Nevada 'fraud': 1,500 ‘dead’ voters, 42,248 voted ‘multiple times,’ RV camps as 'homes.'\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user for further comment.\n\nAll the figures in the claim stem from allegations made in December by a Trump campaign lawyer who unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the certification of Nevada's 2020 election. We'll assess each claim in detail.\n\nFact check: Myanmar's November election had hand vote count; Dominion does no work there\n\nClaim: 42,000 Nevadans voted more than once\n\nThe claim that 42,000 people voted more than once in Nevada is false. The allegation originates from testimony before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee presented by Trump campaign attorney Jesse Binnall.\n\nThe evidence for Binnall's claims was not shown publicly and was partially obtained through Department of Motor Vehicle records, according to 8 News now.\n\nDerek T. Muller, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Law, analyzed the origins of Binnall's 42,000 figure and found that the claim stemmed from a report by the Republican National Committee's chief data officer, Jesse Kamzol. The report lacked overall methodology and underlying data.\n\nCarson City District Judge James Russell ruled against the Trump campaign's request to block the certification of Nevada's presidential election results in early December.\n\nThe court concluded that the Kamzol's data was not credible, and Russell wrote that his methodology \"had little to no information about or supervision over the origins of his data, the manner in which it had been matched, and what the rate of false positives would be. Additionally, there was little or no verification of his numbers.\"\n\nIn the 35-page order, Russell also wrote that \"the record does not support a finding that any Nevada voter voted twice.\"\n\nFact check: Meme of 9 questions makes false inauguration claims\n\nClaim: 19,000 voters didn't live in Nevada\n\nSimilar to the social media post, Binnall also claimed in his testimony that 19,000 people voted even though they did not live in Nevada, not including military voters or students. He wrote that the voters were identified by comparing lists of voters with the U.S. Postal Service's National Change of Address database.\n\nIn regards to the allegation that out-of-state residents voted in Nevada, Russell wrote there is no evidence to \"support a finding that election officials counted mail ballots from voters who also voted in other states.\"\n\nA case used to support this claim included a person seeing voters arriving to vote with out-of-state license plates. However, Russell wrote that this was not evidence proving that those voters were not eligible to vote in Nevada, or that the voter had also cast a ballot in a different state.\n\nFact check: Nancy Pelosi will not resign if Donald Trump is acquitted in impeachment trial\n\nClaim: 15,000 votes cast from commercial addresses; 8,000 from nonexistent addresses\n\nClaims that Nevada voters were registered at commercial addresses and nonexistent addresses are false and again originate from Binnall's testimony in the Trump campaign's case.\n\nBinnall claimed that experts purportedly found 15,000 votes cast from commercial or vacant addresses by analyzing U.S. Postal Service records that flag nonresidential addresses and addresses vacant for more than 90 days. The 8,000 voters with nonexistent addresses were allegedly found by cross referencing voters with the Coding Accuracy Support System.\n\nHowever, the court found no evidence to support claims that \"election officials counted ballots from voters who did not meet Nevada residency requirements.\"\n\nIn his ruling, Russell further wrote that the Postal Service did not deliver mail-in ballots to \"addresses where the addressee of the ballot was known to be deceased, known to have moved from that address, or had no affiliation with that address at all.\"\n\nFact check: Meme of fake email perpetuates conspiracy theory\n\nClaim: 4,000 noncitizens voted\n\nBinnall's claim that almost 4,000 noncitizens voted was purportedly found by comparing official DMV records of noncitizens to 2020 voter rolls.\n\nDMV spokesman Kevin Malone told the Nevada Independent that it provided the Trump campaign with a list of the names and addresses of people who obtained a driver's license or driver authorization card using immigration paperwork within the last five years.\n\nHowever, Malone said the list provided was not definitive proof of citizenship or noncitizenship because individuals could obtain citizenship and legally vote after obtaining a driver authorization card.\n\nMichael Kagan, director of the UNLV Immigration Clinic, also noted to the Nevada Independent that \"someone might have been a noncitizen three years ago when they got their driver's license, and they then got citizenship, voted legally, and haven't renewed their license with a new document yet.”\n\nThe Nevada Secretary of State’s Office \"Facts vs. Myths\" page addresses this claim as well and states that it is a felony for noncitizens to register to vote or cast a ballot in Nevada and as of Dec. 18 the office has \"not been presented with evidence of noncitizens voting in the 2020 election.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has also previously debunked claims that voter turnout from noncitizens affected the popular vote in the 2020 presidential race in battleground states.\n\nFact check: Chatham County, Georgia, stopped counting votes when staff ran out of ballots\n\nClaim: 1,500 dead people voted\n\nBinnall's claim that dead people voted in Nevada's presidential election has been repeatedly debunked by election officials.\n\nThe district court said this claim was unfounded based on Nevada Deputy Secretary of State for Elections Wayne Thorley’s testimony on the process to “maintain voter rolls, including removing confirmed deceased voters.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked a similar claim that thousands of ballots were sent to dead people and pets in Nevada. Multiple experts and studies have also confirmed that mailing ballots to dead people is possible but extremely rare. Claims that these cases lead to voter fraud are unproven.\n\nFact check:Claim that Pennsylvania case is proof of ‘dead people’ voting is under investigation\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe claim that Nevada's 2020 presidential election included cases of duplicate voting, dead voters, fake addresses and noncitizens voting is FALSE, based on our research. The claims in the post are based on a failed lawsuit where a district court found that no illegal votes were cast and counted or that any legal votes were not counted. Biden won Nevada's six electoral votes and those results were finalized by Congress.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Trump spoke at a border security-themed event in Cochise County on Thursday.\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. endorsed Trump on Friday afternoon in downtown Phoenix. Late Thursday, Kennedy filed to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot.\n\nKennedy appeared with Trump at the rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale on Friday.\n\nFoo Fighters didn’t lend anthem to Trump campaign, band says\n\nFoo Fighters didn’t give Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump permission to use 1997 song “My Hero” at Friday’s rally in Glendale, the American Rock band said.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWhen asked by a user on X if the band let Trump use the song to introduce former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the band simply replied, “No.”\n\nKennedy dropped out of the race earlier in the day, giving his endorsement to Trump after a 16-month campaign.\n\nThe band performed the same song at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in honor of former President Barack Obama after he accepted his party’s nomination to run for a second term. Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl has publicly spoken against Trump in the past, with the topic coming up in his music.\n\n— Helen Rummel\n\nRepublicans still workshopping a Trumpian nickname for Harris\n\nRepublicans haven’t settled on a derisive nickname for Kamala Harris, trying out a number of options during Donald Trump’s Arizona campaign swing. Trump referred to Harris as “Comrade Kamala” on Thursday during a trip to the southern border, trying to cast her as a “radical leftist” during a news conference. Earlier in the month, his campaign used the term “Kamabla” to describe her on social media.\n\nTrump allies tried out a few more nicknames Friday. Goya Foods CEO Bob Unanue referred to the vice president as “Que Mala” when he warmed up the crowd at Trump’s rally in Glendale. Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point Action used Harris’s first name to make a play on communism, calling it “Kamala-unism.”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK Jr. siblings call his Trump endorsement ‘sad ending to a sad story’\n\nA group of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s siblings called their brother’s endorsement on Friday of Republican former President Donald Trump “a betrayal” of their father’s and family’s values. They are the children of former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, D-N.Y., who was assassinated while running for president in 1968.\n\n“We want an America filled with hope and bound together by a shared vision of a brighter future, a future defined by individual freedom, economic promise and national pride,” sister Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, sister Courtney Kennedy, sister Kerry Kennedy, brother Chris Kennedy and sister Rory Kennedy said in a joint written statement posted to the social media platform X.\n\n“We believe in (the Democratic ticket of Kamala) Harris and (Tim) Walz. Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear. It is a sad ending to a sad story.”\n\nIn an appearance at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel, RFK Jr. announced that he was suspending his independent presidential campaign and backing Trump. He said he was working to withdraw his name from the ballot in about 10 “battleground states” where he could potentially be a spoiler who would help the Democrats.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nFact check: Data shows illegal border crossings into Arizona much lower than Trump claims\n\nDonald Trump claimed during his rally in Glendale that 3 million people have come through the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona.\n\nTrump made the claim while praising former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was seated in a front row.\n\n“Do you remember when Sheriff Joe was at the border. You didn’t have people coming in. I think for the one year he had one person come in but they got him,” Trump said. “Now we have 3 million people coming in through your border, your border.”\n\nMaricopa County, however, does not share a border with Mexico, although Arpaio did conduct crime suppression sweeps in predominantly Latino neighborhoods that were aimed at identifying and deporting people in the country illegally. A federal judge later ruled Arpaio’s immigration actions were unlawful.\n\nTrump’s claim that 3 million people have come through the Arizona border with Mexico is also not accurate, based on a review of U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\nOver the past four fiscal years, Border Patrol agents and CBP officers have encountered a total of nearly 2 million people unauthorized to legally enter the U.S. in the Tucson and Yuma sectors.\n\nThe number includes unauthorized migrants encountered at official ports of entry and between ports of entry. The Yuma sector straddles both the Arizona and California borders, so not all of the encounters took place in Arizona.\n\nWhat’s more, the number includes encounters that occurred from Oct. 1, 2020, through July of this year. That period covers the Biden administration as well as the last three months of the Trump administration.\n\nThe 2 million number also only includes unauthorized migrants encountered by CBP officers and Border Patrol agents during that period, not the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the U.S. and remain while asylum claims are pending. Many were deported to Mexico or other countries, either immediately or later. The 2 million encounters also do not represent 2 million individual people since many migrants attempt to cross again after being sent back to Mexico and each apprehension is counted as a separate encounter.\n\nIn his 3 million number, Trump may have been including the number of so-called “gotaways” — unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. after evading Border Patrol agents in addition to unauthorized migrant encounters. However, data for the estimated number of “gotaways” by the Border Patrol is not published by CBP.\n\n— Daniel Gonzalez\n\nTrump wraps up remarks after nearly 90 minutes\n\nFormer President Donald Trump put a clear focus on immigration during his remarks, which lasted more than an hour.\n\nHe bashed Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, as a “border tsar” and called her a “flip-flopper” who changes her stance on issues. Trump attacked Harris for supporting so-called sanctuary cities when she was the San Francisco district attorney. He also hammered her for praising the “defund the police” movement in 2020, bringing the president of the Arizona Police Association on stage to make his point.\n\nThe Republican former president also relished in making personal attacks, saying that he doesn’t listen to his advisers who tell him to talk about policy, not personality.\n\n“I have to get personal,” Trump said, saying that speakers at the Democratic National Convention such as former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama were “nasty.”\n\nTrump polled the rally crowd on whether he should refer to Harris as “comrade Kamala” and at one point did an imitation of her “choking.” He also attacked Rep. Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat running for Senate against Trump-endorsed Republican Kari Lake, as a “fricken loser”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nHarris launches new economy-focused ad, billboard blitz\n\nKamala Harris is airing a new economy-focused TV ad in Arizona and other battleground states, her campaign said Friday. The 30-second spot features a direct-to-camera appeal from Harris, along with press coverage of her campaign’s new economic plan.\n\n“Middle class families, like the one I grew up in, they want common sense solutions,” Harris says in the ad. “We must create an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to get a car loan, buy a home, start a business.”\n\nThe commercial is part of an eight-figure ad buy across eight battleground states. The campaign did not say how much it is spending to promote the spot in Arizona.\n\nHarris is also using digital billboards around Arizona for an advertising blitz to counter Trump’s visit to the state. The billboards feature the slogan “A NEW WAY FORWARD” and a photo of Harris on a blue background. The Harris campaign billboard ads cover 35% of billboard inventory within a 12-mile radius of Phoenix, Tucson and Mesa, her campaign said.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nArizona Police Association president joins rally\n\nJustin Harris, the president of the Arizona Police Association, joined Donald Trump on stage in Glendale to voice his support for the Republican presidential nominee.\n\n“He always had our backs,” Harris said of Trump’s relationship with law enforcement.\n\nHarris criticized Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, referencing her comments about \"reimagining\" public safety made in 2020.\n\nJustin Harris said Trump will provide the funding and support he’s looking for, pointing to fears surrounding border issues and drug trafficking which have been common talking points throughout Trump's campaign.\n\nHarris was most recently in public view for denouncing the U.S. Department of Justice's investigation into the Phoenix Police Department, which was released earlier this year.\n\n— Helen Rummel\n\nTrump allies eager to compare his crowd to Harris\n\nDonald Trump’s Glendale rally is the perfect opportunity for a crowd size comparison — Kamala Harris drew 15,000 people to the same venue earlier this month. His allies were happy to compare the crowds on Friday.\n\n“We have more people than Kamala had — outside,” Tyler Bowyer of Turning Point Action said, referencing the long line outside the arena. The arena seats 19,300 people, according to its management company.\n\nThere were approximately 12,000-13,000 people inside Desert Diamond Arena as of 3:30 p.m. on Friday, according to a police officer monitoring the crowd. That number will go up, he said, because a long line of Trump supporters were still waiting to get into the building.\n\n“Someone who wants to be president had an event here and she had to partition all this off,\" Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk said. \"We draw a bigger crowd than Kamala Harris, don’t we?”\n\nState Rep. Justin Heap, who is running for Maricopa County recorder, echoed Trump claims that Harris is using artificial intelligence to inflate her crowd sizes.\n\n“You don’t need to use AI to make it look like the seats are full,” Heap said.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK takes the stage; Trump pitches assassination attempts commission\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. received a warm welcome at Donald Trump’s rally, coming on stage to pyrotechnics and the Foo Fighters song “My Hero.”\n\nKennedy suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed Trump in Phoenix on Friday morning, saying that he would take his name off the ballot in battleground states to avoid being a spoiler in the race.\n\nKennedy told the Glendale rally crowd that he and Trump don’t agree on everything, but they found common ground on “having safe food and ending the chronic disease epidemic” and each want to “end the grip of the neocons on U.S. foreign policy.”\n\n\"Don't you want a president who is going to get us out of the wars?\" Kennedy asked.\n\nTrump praised Kennedy as a “phenomenal person” as the crowd chanted, “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.” The former GOP president told supporters that Kennedy called him after his attempted assassination in Pennsylvania last month.\n\n“Upon my election, I will establish a new independent presidential commission on assassination attempts,” Trump said, noting that he will release all remaining classified information on President John F. Kennedy’s assassination.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump takes the stage in Arizona\n\nDonald Trump took the stage Friday in Glendale at around 4:30 p.m.\n\n“A very big hello, Arizona. Hello, Phoenix,” Trump said.\n\n“We are going to win Arizona. We’re going to defeat comrade Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\nTrump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew a rally crowd of more than 13,000 people to Desert Diamond Arena, the same venue where Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, rallied a crowd of 15,000 earlier in August.\n\nTrump and Harris are locked in a tight battle in battleground Arizona, with statewide polls showing the Democratic nominee slightly ahead. Both campaigns expect Arizona could come down to a small number of ballots — President Joe Biden beat Trump by fewer than 11,000 votes four years ago.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMaricopa County recorder candidate makes pitch to independents, Democrats\n\nRepublican Justin Heap used his time on stage to make his first appeal to voters outside his base since winning his primary for Maricopa County recorder last month.\n\nHe will face Democrat Tim Stringham for the seat in November. Swing voters are expected to play a key role in the pivotal race, which will determine who controls voter registration and early voting in Arizona’s most populous county. Heap’s remarks came a little more than 30 minutes before former President Donald Trump was expected to take the stage, a prime time slot for a local race.\n\n“To the independents and Democrats in the room today … join me,” Heap said. “Free and fair and honest elections is not a Republican issue, it is an everyone issue.”\n\nHeap said he was running to “secure our elections” and called for full election results on election night. That isn't possible under current state law and wouldn't be attainable without significant changes to when voters are permitted to return early ballots.\n\n— Sasha Hupka\n\nOfficials treat dozens of rally attendees Friday afternoon\n\nThe Glendale Fire Department treated more than 100 Trump rally attendees for things such as heat-related illnesses, Assistant Chief Tim Pirtle told The Republic.\n\nPirtle said the sheer volume of patients delayed Glendale firefighters' ability to treat and transport people to the hospital.\n\nBy about 3:20 p.m., nearly all attendees had made their way into air conditioning, according to Pirtle.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, the temperature in Glendale was about 104 degrees with partly cloudy skies, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Rey Covarrubias Jr.\n\nVoter turnout a big focus at Trump rally\n\nAhead of Donald Trump’s appearance in Glendale, speakers at his rally called on attendees to drive GOP turnout in Arizona. Trump lost Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes in 2020 — the smallest margin of any state in his battle against President Joe Biden four years ago.\n\n“We need every vote. We can win Arizona,” said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz. “Will you help us get every Republican voter to the ballot?”\n\nThe rally is co-hosted by Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action, the Arizona-based conservative group that is helping turn out voters for Trump.\n\n“This is our election to lose,” said Rep. Eli Crane, R-Ariz., encouraging the crowd to help Turning Point “chase ballots” this fall. “We can’t count on Donald Trump to carry this entire load on his back.” Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., put it plainly: \"Please ask your neighbors to vote — unless they’re Democrats.”\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMaricopa superintendent candidate: ‘Students need to be taught the importance of our constitution’\n\nMaricopa County School superintendent candidate Shelli Boggs declared schools a battleground while taking the podium in Glendale. She said teachers aren’t being supported and parents have been “disrespected” and “ignored” as their tax dollars fund the destruction of education.\n\nDuring her campaign, Boggs has portrayed herself as a fierce advocate for depoliticizing American classrooms. At the same time, she has said she does not want schools to teach about racism, transgender students should not use facilities that align with their gender identity and schools should discourage talk of pronouns.\n\n“Students need to be taught the importance of our constitution and what it means to be an American. Now more than ever, we must protect and strengthen our schools,” Boggs said.\n\n— Nicholas Sullivan\n\nHeat, long lines discourage some Trump fans\n\nThousands of people stood in line outside Desert Diamond Arena on Friday afternoon in the 104-degree heat, hoping to get a seat inside for Trump’s rally. Terrence Feller, 62, came from Casa Grande to see the former president with his daughter. They saw the long line and decided to turn around, especially after speaking with one attendee who arrived at 9 a.m. and was just entering the arena after 1 p.m.\n\n“It has to be a mile,” he said. “After seeing how long the line is, we decided to turn around and go back to Casa Grande.”\n\nFeller said he’s voting for Trump because he’ll boost the economy and “get us back on the right energy path, where we’re selling instead of buying.”\n\nAs someone who works at a migrant detention center, Feller named the border as another top issue and said immigration is a much larger issue than is presented in the media.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nCrowd begins to fill stands at Desert Diamond Arena\n\nMore than two hours before former President Donald Trump was scheduled to take the stage in Glendale, thousands of supporters filled in much of Desert Diamond Arena’s lower bowl.\n\nThe upper section of the arena was not yet occupied as state Sen. Jake Hoffman, R-Queen Creek, fired up the crowd. The venue has a capacity of close to 19,000, according to its website.\n\n— Ray Stern\n\nHarris campaign reaches out to RFK Jr. supporters\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, Democrat Kamala Harris’ campaign chair, reacted to independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s decision to suspend his campaign by reaching out to his supporters.\n\n“For any American out there who is tired of Donald Trump and looking for a new way forward, ours is a campaign for you,” O’Malley Dillon said Friday in a written statement. “In order to deliver for working people and those who feel left behind, we need a leader who will fight for you, not just for themselves, and bring us together, not tear us apart. Vice President Harris wants to earn your support.”\n\n“Even if we do not agree on every issue, Kamala Harris knows there is more that unites us than divides us: respect for our rights, public safety, protecting our freedoms, and opportunity for all.”\n\nSpeaking Friday in downtown Phoenix, Kennedy announced that he is suspending his campaign and backing Donald Trump. He said he is working to remove his name from the ballot in about 10 “battleground states” where polling suggests he might play spoiler to the benefit of the Democrats.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nWho else will be speaking at the Trump rally in Glendale?\n\nA number of Republicans running for office were scheduled to speak at the rally, according to Turning Point Action, including Kari Lake, candidate for U.S. Senate; Abe Hamadeh, candidate for Arizona’s 8th Congressional District; Jerry Sheridan, candidate for Maricopa County sheriff; Justin Heap, candidate for Maricopa County recorder; and Shelli Boggs, candidate for Maricopa County school superintendent.\n\nTurning Point Action asked people to register for the rally via the Trump campaign website, which allowed people to sign up for two tickets per mobile phone number. Attendance will be first come, first serve, according to the Turning Point Action.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nRFK Jr. suspends his campaign, endorses Trump\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent presidential candidate, announced Friday in downtown Phoenix that he is suspending his presidential campaign and backing Republican former President Donald Trump.\n\n“I want everyone to know that I'm not terminating my campaign. I am simply suspending it and not ending it,” a hoarse-sounding Kennedy said from a ballroom inside the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel. \"My name will remain on the ballot in most states.\"\n\nIn \"about 10 battleground states,\" where he could play spoiler in favor of the Democrats, Kennedy said he is withdrawing his name from the ballots. The Arizona Secretary of State's Office confirmed Thursday to The Arizona Republic that he filed to take his name of the ballot here.\n\nTrump is set headline a rally later Friday at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale. Since Thursday, the Trump campaign has been touting the appearance of an unnamed “special guest” at the event. Trump said Thursday he would consider an RFK Jr. endorsement\n\nKennedy, a former Democrat, is the son of slain 1968 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of assassinated President John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy said Friday that he left the party because the Democrats have abandoned “the core values I grew up with.” He said he believed he would have won the election \"in an honest system.\"\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\nWhat time is Donald Trump's rally in Glendale?\n\nFormer president and 2024 Republican nominee Donald Trump has a rally scheduled in Glendale on Friday afternoon, the day after the close of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and Vice President Kamala Harris' speech accepting the Democratic nomination.\n\nTrump will appear at Desert Diamond Arena, the same venue where Harris held a rally earlier this month. The event will be co-hosted by conservative groups Turning Point PAC and Turning Point Action.\n\nTrump's rally in Glendale was scheduled to begin at 4 p.m., according to the former president's campaign. Doors open for attendees at 11 a.m., and \"pre-programming\" was expected to start at 2 p.m., according to Turning Point Action.\n\nArizona is an \"emerging problem\" for Trump, one longtime political observer said recently, and Trump’s own allies have said he should be in the state more often.\n\nTrump visited Arizona's southern border on Thursday. The former president painted a grisly, violent picture of illegal immigration during a tour of the U.S.-Mexico border, using Cochise County as the backdrop for his counterprogramming on the day the vice president accepted her party’s presidential nomination.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nWhere has Donald Trump been campaigning this week?\n\nDonald Trump hit the campaign trail in several battleground states this week.\n\nOn Monday, the former president spoke to a crowd of supporters on a factory floor in the working-class city of York, Pennsylvania, and vowed to end rules created by the Environmental Protection Agency that would limit air and water pollution from power plants.\n\n\"It's a disaster for our country,\" Trump said. \"Instead of shutting down power plants, we will open dozens and dozens more, and they'll happen fast.\"\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, are appearing at series of campaign events in Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada and Georgia in addition to Trump’s stop in Arizona.\n\n— Melissa Cruz, USA TODAY\n\nWhere is Donald Trump on Friday morning? In Las Vegas\n\nBefore his rally in Glendale on Friday afternoon, Donald Trump will speak at a restaurant in Las Vegas about noon to discuss his campaign promise to not tax tips. Trump flew to Las Vegas after his Arizona border visit on Thursday afternoon.\n\nRFK Jr. files to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot\n\nIndependent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. late Thursday filed to withdraw his name from Arizona's Nov. 5 ballot, the Arizona Secretary of State's Office confirmed to The Arizona Republic.\n\nKennedy filed to withdraw around 5:30 p.m., according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Adrian Fontes.\n\nSpeculation has swirled about Kennedy considering ending his campaign and endorsing former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nKennedy is scheduled to speak Friday in Phoenix about his \"path forward.\" Later in the day, Trump is holding a rally with an unnamed \"special guest\" at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nMan suspected of threatening Trump has been arrested\n\nThe Cochise County Sheriff's Office said Thursday it arrested a man who authorities say made threats on social media against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"The Cochise County Sheriff's Office was made aware of threatening statements made via social media by the subject Ronald Syvrud towards candidate Trump,\" Carol Capas, a department spokesperson, told The Arizona Republic. \"As a result, additional information was developed confirming outstanding warrants for this subject, and a subsequent public release was issued.\"\n\nTrump made a stop Thursday at the U.S.-Mexico border in Cochise County. He told the media there that he was unaware of the then-ongoing manhunt for Syvrud.\n\n“But no, I haven’t heard that but I’m not that surprised,\" Trump said. \"And the reason is I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys. I have heard that it's very unsafe to make this trip. There were some people who really didn't want me to make it.\"\n\nSyvrud, 66, of Benson, had \"outstanding warrants from the state of Wisconsin for DUI/Failure to Appear for DUI and from Graham County Arizona for Hit/Run and Felony Failure to Register as a Sex Offender,\" the Cochise County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook.\n\n— Perry Vandell\n\nArizona Democrats blast Trump 'border stunt'\n\nArizona Democrats dismissed former President Donald Trump’s appearance Thursday in Cochise County as a “border stunt.”\n\nThe state Democratic Party in a written statement said Trump went to the U.S.-Mexico border “to take attention away from Democrats hosting one of the largest political rallies in our state's history and a Democratic Convention where Arizona Democrats solidified our status as the future of the party.”\n\nThe Democrats also highlighted what they called Trump’s “long record of demonizing immigrants, promising mass deportations, and killing bipartisan solutions that would help border states like Arizona.”\n\nTrump’s role in torpedoing a bipartisan Senate border compromise has been a constant line of attack from Democrats. Trump urged Republicans to reject the deal so as not to give President Joe Biden an election-year legislative victory.\n\nThe state party also recalled Trump’s odd decision to kiss former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio on stage at an event earlier this year at Dream City Church in Phoenix.\n\n\"I don't kiss men. But I kissed him,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nAs president, Trump pardoned Arpaio, an anti-immigration hardliner who in 2017 had been convicted of criminal contempt of court as part of a long-running case involving racial profiling by his agency.\n\n— Dan Nowicki\n\n'Special guest' touted to appear Friday at Trump's Glendale rally\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign on Thursday announced that an unnamed \"special guest\" would join Trump on Friday at his afternoon rally at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale.\n\nThe announcement comes amid speculation that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. intends to bow out of the race and endorse Trump.\n\nKennedy, the son of slain 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, is expected to make his own late morning appearance Friday in Phoenix where he will discuss his \"path forward.\"\n\nAsked at an Arizona border stop about the Kennedy speculation, Trump said there were no plans for Kennedy to appear with him in Glendale.\n\nTrump called Kennedy “smart” and “a little bit different but that’s OK.\"\n\nLater, the Trump campaign said in a written statement: \"President Trump will be joined by a special guest as he delivers remarks about his America First policies and his vision to lower inflation and the cost of living, secure the border, and make our cities safe again.\"\n\nAnnounced guest speakers at the Trump rally include Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk; Senate candidate Kari Lake; U.S. Reps. Andy Biggs, Eli Crane and Paul Gosar; congressional candidate Abe Hamadeh; and Maricopa County sheriff candidate Jerry Sheridan.\n\n— Dan Nowicki and Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump unaware of police search for man suspected of threatening him\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, speaking at the Arizona-Mexico border, addressed a Cochise County manhunt for a person suspected of making threats against him.\n\nResponding to a question from the media, Trump said he was unaware of the situation.\n\n\"I've heard it's dangerous, but I also have a job to do. I heard it's very dangerous. I haven't heard about that,\" Trump said. \"They probably want to keep it from me. Thank you for telling me.\"\n\nTrump added that he has \"great respect\" for the Secret Service, which came under bipartisan fire last month after Trump was wounded in a July 13 assassination attempt.\n\n\"Mistakes were made, and they're going to learn from the mistakes,\" he said.\n\nThe Cochise County Sheriff's Office confirmed to The Arizona Republic Thursday that they were searching for Ronald Syvrud, a 66-year-old Benson resident, after it \"was made aware of threatening statements made via social media.\"\n\n“But no, I haven’t heard that but I’m not that surprised,\" Trump said. \"And the reason is I want to do things that are very bad for the bad guys. I have heard that it's very unsafe to make this trip. There were some people who really didn't want me to make it.\"\n\n— Dan Nowicki, Stephanie Murray and Perry Vandell\n\nAn RFK Jr. endorsement would be a great honor, Trump says\n\nTrump said he hasn’t spoken recently with independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. but acknowledged speculation that Kennedy may drop out of the race Friday. That would be a great honor, Trump said.\n\nTrump noted the pair will both be in Arizona tomorrow but said there are no plans for Kennedy to appear at his rally in Glendale.\n\nTrump called Kennedy “smart” and “a little bit different but that’s O.K.\"\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump calls Harris 'a Marxist' who wants open borders\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his remarks at the border by knocking President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The former president addressed reporters with law enforcement officials and families of victims of crimes committed by people who crossed the border illegally.\n\nTrump referred to Harris as a “Marxist” and claimed she wants “open borders.” He gave his speech at an unfinished portion of the border wall in Cochise County, and often gestured to pieces of the wall piled nearby.\n\n“It could have been put up in a matter of weeks,” Trump said, calling the barrier the “Rolls-Royce” of walls.\n\nHe was joined by the family of Rachel Morin, who was raped and murdered in 2023 in Maryland. An immigrant from El Salvador was arrested and charged in connection with the crimes.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump arrives at the Arizona-Mexico border\n\nDonald Trump arrived at the southern border shortly after noon Thursday. He was joined by campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, along with Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nThe former president exited his motorcade and met with Cochise County officials at the border wall.\n\nHe was wearing a blue suit and red tie.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nTrump changes tune on the Obamas\n\nTrump, a harsh critic of Obama and his time in office, actually offered some rare praise for his predecessor while speaking to reporters Tuesday. That praise? Trump referred to the 44th president as a “nice gentleman” whom he happens to “like and respect,” in an interview with CNN.\n\n“I thought he was a terrible president. He didn’t do the job. He let people take advantage of us on trade,” Trump said while on the campaign trail in Michigan. “Especially trade — he was very weak on trade. But I happen to like him. I respect him and his wife.”\n\nTrump was not too thrilled with Barack and Michelle Obama's comments at the national convention.\n\n\"Did you see Barack Hussein Obama last night take shots? He was taking shots at your president,\" Trump said at a rally in Asheboro, North Carolina, on Wednesday, the day after the Obamas spoke at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe use of Obama's full name harkens back to Trump's promotion of the “birther” conspiracy, a false claim about Obama’s birthplace that Trump eventually walked back in 2016.\n\n\"He was very nasty last night. I try to be nice to people you know, but it gets a little tough when they get personal,\" Trump continued.\n\nTrump mentioned that his campaign advisers tried to keep him from getting \"personal\" and to stick with policy talk. He asked the crowd if he should follow that advice or get personal. The crowd responded wanting him to get personal.\n\n— Joyce Orlando, USA TODAY\n\nHeavy security at Trump border stop\n\nAwaiting Donald Trump’s visit to Arizona, Secret Service agents, Cochise County sheriff officers and other law enforcement lined a dirt road leading to the U.S.-Mexico border. The former president was set to arrive at Sierra Vista Municipal Airport on Thursday morning, tour a portion of the border near Coronado National Monument and speak with the press.— Stephanie Murray and Sarah Lapidus\n\nDonald Trump to rally at same Glendale arena as Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump will hit the campaign trail in Glendale on Friday, holding a rally at the same venue where Kamala Harris drew a crowd of 15,000 people earlier this month.\n\nIt’s the perfect opportunity for a crowd size comparison.\n\nThe Republican former president is under pressure to upstage Harris by packing Desert Diamond Arena with a huge crowd. It’s a comparison of his own making: Trump has been disputing the size of Harris’ fired-up campaign crowds lately, even falsely claiming she used artificial intelligence because her sea of supporters was so large at a recent event.\n\nThe event marks Trump’s first large-scale campaign event in battleground Arizona since Harris became the Democratic nominee. Trump had a comfortable lead over President Joe Biden in the state, but the race has tightened now that Harris is his opponent.\n\n“Until Kamala Harris took the top of the ticket, Trump was known for throwing the better party,” said Stacey Pearson, a Phoenix Democratic political consultant.\n\nThe size of a rally is not an indicator of who will win an election, but a campaign crowd can provide a peek into how enthusiastic voters are about a particular candidate. That’s notable in Arizona, where Biden had struggled to get voters excited to turn out before he left the race.\n\n— Stephanie Murray\n\nDonald Trump has visited Arizona often. Here's the list\n\nFor years, Arizona has been one of former President Donald Trump's favorite spots to campaign.\n\nHe was a frequent visitor in 2015 and 2016 on his way to the Republican nomination. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Arizona in 2016 to capture the state's 11 electoral votes.\n\nIn 2020, despite multiple visits, Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes. He returned for additional rallies after his presidency, often lamenting a \"stolen\" and \"rigged\" election.\n\nIn 2024, Trump again has ramped up his time in Arizona as he makes another run for the presidency, this time taking on Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n— Ronald J. Hansen\n\nWho is leading in the polls in Arizona?\n\nIt’s hard to say which presidential candidate, Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris, is ahead in Arizona, generally regarded as one of the nation's seven swing states in the 2024 election.\n\nRecent public polling has run from Harris ahead by 5 percentage points to Trump leading by 4.\n\nBy comparison, Trump led every public poll involving him and Biden in Arizona tracked by the nonpartisan website FiveThirtyEight in June and July, sometimes by double digits.\n\nThe reality is the shake-up of the Democratic ticket, followed by the party’s national convention, has likely boosted Harris’ standing in the polls. The convention ends Thursday, and public opinion could be more stable after that, at least until the rivals' Sept. 10 debate in Philadelphia.\n\nPollsters won’t have a clean look at public opinion for at least another week, leaving the state’s uncertain status unchanged for at least a few more days.\n\nThe major political ratings organizations all list Arizona as a toss-up at the moment.\n\n— Ronald J.

Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n“What this project does, is show what we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save lives,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. “We think this is going to be a really important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make that case clearly.”\n\nThe findings of the study have come into sharp focus following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials told CNN that the gunman legally purchased two assault rifles for his 18th birthday.\n\nTexas has steadily loosened restrictions on gun ownership over the past several years. Last September, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. Texas is ranked 34 out of 50 states in Everytown’s gun law strength ranking.\n\nTo compile its list, the group used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50 policies that they say are scientifically proven to be effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.\n\nThe research team then weighed the list of gun safety policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its implementation of those policies and compared that score with the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.\n\nThe CDC’s data includes homicides, accidental killings and suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 people in the United States were killed with a firearm in 2020 – more than half died by suicide.\n\nThe analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the top of the list for gun law strength – a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, with a low rate of 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 residents, and below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with firearms in 9% of households, the data shows.\n\nFew gun control laws passed as 2022 sessions wrap\n\nAs state legislatures wrap up their2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across various states.\n\n“I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and effective,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Gun laws work, and we need them across the board to ensure that felons, domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can’t simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws meant to keep guns out of their hands.”\n\nCNN reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) to comment on the research before it was first published in January, but it declined to do so before seeing the data.\n\nMississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out of 100 and has a rate of 28.6 gun deaths per 100,000 residents – the highest of all states, the research shows.\n\nMassachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the second-lowest rate of gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.\n\n“Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can’t pretend to be ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at this report,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six educators.\n\nMother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is “tearing our community apart.”\n\nNearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre “Dre” Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic paralysis.\n\n“As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that was taken away,” Dycus said. “My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.”\n\n“But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it pertains to what it looks like to survive,” she said. “Dre has embodied that.”\n\nMembers of Moms Demand Action protest in Texas on Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Austin, Texas, after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill allowing Texans age 21 or older to carry handguns without a permit. Ana Ramirez/AP/FILE\n\nSecure storage laws deemed essential to gun safety\n\nEverytown designated a list of five foundational laws that have proven to be the most effective in lowering gun violence rates. These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that temporarily remove a person’s access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states – including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming – passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan. Four students were killed on November 30, when student Ethan Crumbley allegedly opened fire. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial “constitutional carry” legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an “artificial barrier” to residents’ right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to “the protection of themselves or their families” in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n“As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we’ve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials’ homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,” Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a “textbook example” of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year’s legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown’s research shows that 21 of the country’s states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded. There is no federal database of gun sales, but other independent surveys have found that gun sales have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Priya Krishnakumar", "Emma Tucker", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/04/fact-check-typo-led-false-post-michigan-votes-biden/6164385002/", "title": "Fact check: Typo led to false post about Michigan votes for Biden", "text": "Corrections & clarifications: This story has been updated to reflect the source of the voting data error, a clerical error in Shiawassee County, Michigan, that caused an incorrect vote tally to be reported in government data.\n\nThe claim: 100K votes in Michigan were 'magically' added to Biden's vote tally during the night.\n\nAfter weeks of warnings of potential voting fraud, the sudden purported overnight surge of more than 100,000 votes in Michigan — all for Vice President Joe Biden — sent social media into overdrive.\n\nThe allegation was picked up by conservative social media posters, widely shared and eventually retweeted by President Donald Trump.\n\nThe social media claims were accompanied with screenshots of vote tallies showing an addition of 138,339 votes for Biden, but none for anyone else.

He says he saw the error on the media site DecisionDeskHQ, which had received the information from Shiawassee County. The county had erroneously plugged in the number 153,710 for Biden instead of the accurate 15,371. As a result, Biden's total quickly ballooned not only in the county tally, but also in the statewide tally.\n\n\"I noticed the errors myself in trying to follow the vote count on multiple sites and resolve disparities,\" he tells USA TODAY.\n\nDecisionDeskHQ later tweeted: \"This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data.

For instance, a candidate running for the Hawaii House of Representatives could secure up to $50,000 by gathering support from 200 contributors, each donating $5 to their campaign.\n\nThe funding amounts would vary depending on the position sought, with gubernatorial and lieutenant governor candidates potentially receiving up to $2.5 million. However, candidates seeking public funding must adhere to spending limits and be prohibited from raising private donations.\n\nIf these bills are passed, the system will be implemented for the 2028 elections. The program’s funding, $30 million from the state's coffers, would involve transferring money from the Hawaii Election Campaign Fund to the Campaign Spending Commission.\n\nHawaii has struggled with voter turnout for decades:\n\nHawaii hasn’t’ always struggled to get voters to the polls. After achieving statehood in 1959, voter participation in the general election soared to over 93%.\n\nWhy the voting numbers have plummeted over the decades remains fodder for political scientists and state officials. Based on registered voting lists, more than 100,000 people were considered “inactive voters” - moved, died, or went to prison - but by federal law, they can’t be purged for several inactive cycles, according to the state Office of Elections.\n\nThe 2020 presidential election between incumbent President Donald Trump and Democratic contender Joe Biden saw a decent voter turnout of 69.6%, but in 2022, a non-presidential year, just 48.4% of voters cast ballots in the state’s general election, an all-time low.\n\nColin Moore, a professor at the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization, argues that publicly funded elections would encourage electoral competition, more direct engagement with voters and boost voter turnout.\n\n“You have a system like this, (politicians will) spend more time engaging with the community and less time engaging with donors,” Moore told USA Today. “The other hope is that you’re engaging a different group of donors. I mean, the people who can provide $5 are very different from the people who can provide $1,000. And so there’s a hope that this will boost turnout as well.”\n\nMore:Hawaii looks to combat AI-generated deepfakes and disinformation ahead of 2024 elections\n\nMoore says the key to the reform is ensuring that candidates who use public funds can receive enough money to compete with private funds. Since 1994, the average election spending for incumbents in the Hawaii House has been $57,883, whereas challengers, in inflation-adjusted dollars, have spent only $16,500 on average.\n\n“I mean, politicians are rational actors. If they think that it’s’ not going to be enough money to win, then they’re going to opt out, and they’re going to raise private money. If it is enough money, then this is, in many cases, easier for them,” Moore said. “But $50,000 is enough money (for a local race)\n\nResidents testify in support of the bill:\n\nOver 500 pages of testimony have already been submitted by residents, activists, and lawmakers. Most supporters believe the legislation bolsters democracy by improving voter access and providing greater transparency regarding candidate donations.\n\n“(This measure) is squarely aimed at defending democracy. We all recognize the threats it faces,” said Dawn Morais Webster, a local advocate and resident. “We’re all aware of the harm caused by Citizens United. However, local government possesses the capability to fight back, and this clean elections bill does just that.”\n\nJoshua DK Lum, a Maui resident, argued that the bill would create a more level playing field for those affected by last year’s Lahaina wildfires that killed 100 people and caused thousands to be displaced from their homes.\n\n“As a concerned citizen deeply affected by the recent wildfires on Maui, I believe this bill is crucial for fostering a more equitable political landscape,” Lum said. “We have seen the negative impacts of pay-to-play politics and the need for accountability, especially in light of the environmental mismanagement contributing to the devastating fires.”\n\nMore:When will the House's remaining 3 open seats be filled? What to know\n\nHawaii State Rep. Jeanne Kapela (D), the first woman and Native Hawaiian to represent her district, envisions the bill injecting excitement into elections by amplifying the influence of women, Native Hawaiians, and working-class individuals.\n\n“This is about ensuring that a wide array of people, who often find their voices unheard in the Legislature, will finally be heard,” Kapela said. “When legislators cater to corporate and donor interests, they neglect the public’s interest.”\n\nIs anyone opposed to the bill?\n\nEarlier this month, Honolulu Civil Beat revealed that Hawaii House Majority Leader Nadine Nakamura opposes the bill, citing concerns about providing an unfair advantage to Republican candidates through taxpayer-funded support.\n\n“Unless you’re a strong candidate, you won’t be able to utilize it. You won’t have the means to gather the $5 contributions from voters.” Rhoads said, “Donald Trump, the most popular Republican in the state, only garnered 30% of the vote (in 2020).

He grew up on the Navajo Nation in the 1940s and later become the chairman and first president of the Navajo Nation following years at civil rights organizations.\n\n“These rights weren’t always there in the form that they’re in now,” he said. “Many people had to do the hard work to fight for these rights and people need to know about that history.”\n\nThe racist history of Arizona blocking or diminishing Latino, Black and Native people’s ability to participate in the political process is long, dating back to the state’s territorial period, and features tactics reminiscent of the Deep South.\n\nThe state employed a strict literary test for voter registration for more than 60 years and as recently as 2013 was one of only 11 states singled out by a section of the Voting Rights Act due to a long record of suppressing minority voters.\n\nAnd some say the state and nation are now in the midst of a “second generation” of discriminatory voting practices — one defined by strict voter ID laws and polling location closures, among other measures, that have taken the place of literacy tests or voter intimidation.\n\nEarlier this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned two Arizona laws that made it more difficult to cast a ballot, noting the laws’ “discriminatory intent” and citing the state’s “long history of race-based voting discrimination.”\n\nThose laws were passed after the U.S. Supreme overturned parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. They remain in place for now, though, as the state appealed the ruling.\n\nRaul Macias, a voting rights counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said some states, including Arizona, used the Supreme Court’s action as an opportunity to impose new restrictions that have disparate impacts on minority voters.\n\nAs a swing state in the 2020 election, Arizona could be a deciding factor in the future of national politics. And experts say minority voters likely will tip the scales.\n\nTerritorial Legislature implements literacy test for voter registration\n\nEfforts to erode the political power of minorities began long before Arizona achieved statehood in 1912.\n\n“Early territorial politicians acted on the belief that it was the ‘manifest destiny’ of the Anglos to triumph in Arizona over the earlier Native American and Hispanic civilizations,” wrote David Berman, a political science professor at Arizona State University, in an expert report prepared for the case the 9th Circuit ruled on earlier this year.\n\nThe land that now makes up most of modern-day Arizona was ceded to the United States from Mexico in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which marked the end of the Mexican-American War. Pursuant to the treaty, the United States conferred citizenship to the roughly 100,000 Hispanics who remained in the territory.\n\nNative Americans at the time were considered members of their sovereign tribal nation, not U.S. citizens. So when citizenship and voting rights were extended to emancipated slaves after the Civil War, Indigenous people remained disenfranchised.\n\nThe early Arizona Territorial Legislature, comprised largely of white settlers, passed an array of discriminatory laws.\n\nThough, perhaps most notably, they imposed a statute in 1909 that required an English literacy test as a prerequisite to voter registration, following in the footsteps of multiple Southern states that implemented literacy tests in the late 19th century.\n\nThe intentions for the law were explicit, Berman said: they were seeking to block the “ignorant Mexican vote,” quoting a letter between Arizona politicians at the time.\n\nA year later, when the federal government authorized Arizona to draft a state Constitution, Congress specifically said the newly adopted literacy test could not be used to block minorities from voting on the proposed state Constitution. The literacy test requirement was subsequently overturned – but not for long.\n\nArizona formed a constitutional convention in 1910 to begin drafting a state Constitution that, once voted on and approved by the federal government and Arizona voters, would officially qualify Arizona as a state.\n\nAll except for one of the delegates was white, according to Berman. By comparison, Hispanics made up one-third of the delegates in New Mexico, which held a constitutional convention to gain statehood the same year.\n\nNew Mexico’s Constitution as written protected citizens’ ability to participate in the political process free from discrimination on account of “race, language or color, or inability to speak, read or write the English or Spanish languages.”\n\nArizona’s Constitution offers a stark contrast: it includes a requirement that an individual “read, write, speak, and understand the English language sufficiently well” to hold a position in public office. That provision remains in the Arizona Constitution today.\n\nNative Americans faced multiple barriers to vote\n\nFollowing approval of the Constitution, Arizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912.\n\nDemocratic state politicians promptly reinstated the literacy test as a prerequisite to voter registration.\n\nCounty registrars did not enforce the requirement equally, Berman said, often administering white citizens easier tests or excusing them from the requirement altogether while expecting Hispanic citizens to pass without error.\n\nAs a result, some counties were left without enough voters to justify holding primaries due to large declines in voter registration.\n\nThe literacy test disenfranchised Latino, Black and — when they finally gained the right to vote — Native voters until it was repealed 60 years later, in 1972.\n\nOn top of the literacy test, Native Americans faced another barrier. More than a decade into Arizona’s statehood, most weren’t conferred as United States citizens.\n\nNative people made up a significant proportion of the state’s population at the time, according to Patty Ferguson-Bohnee, a Native voting rights expert and director of the Indian Legal Clinic at ASU. They comprised 14.3% of the state’s population, according to the 1910 census.\n\n“In some places, that would’ve made a huge difference in who could be elected, if they were able to participate in the political process,” she said.\n\nThe federal government blocked Native American suffrage by employing several arguments — including their residency on reservations and exemption from paying taxes — to discredit arguments for Native citizenship and voting rights, she said.\n\nCongress eventually passed the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924, which should have given Native Americans the right to vote in both state and federal elections. But Arizona politicians, concerned about the potential shift in power, started looking for ways to continue to suppress the Native vote.\n\nA 1928 letter from a legal advisor to then Arizona Gov. George W.P. Hunt shows he was advised to “adopt a systematic course of challenging Indians at the time of election.”\n\nAhead of elections, county officials challenged individual voter registrations, claiming Native Americans were “wards of the nation” and thus ineligible to vote in accordance with the state Constitution. Two Pima County Native residents challenged their rejected voter registrations, but the Arizona Supreme Court sided with the county.\n\nTwenty years later, at the end of World War II, Native men who had played an instrumental role in the war as code-talkers returned to find that they were still denied the right to vote back home.\n\nFrank Harrison and Harry Austin, two men from the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation, sued the state and in 1948, the Arizona Supreme Court ruled in their favor, overturning the prior decision and officially granting Indigenous Arizonans the right to vote.\n\nBut along with other minority groups, that didn’t fully happen in practice until the literacy tests were banished nearly a quarter of a century later.\n\nDespite victories, tactics continue\n\nBecause of continued suppression, the demographics of Arizona’s registered voters didn’t change much for the next two decades despite the legal victories. Arizona systematically denied voting rights and access to minority voting-age citizens through both official and unofficial suppression tactics.\n\nThe English literacy test requirement remained the most effective obstacle to voting rights for Arizona’s Latino, Black and Native American citizens for several decades, experts say.\n\nAfter the 1948 ruling in favor of Native Americans, about 80% to 90% remained disenfranchised because they could not read or speak English, according to Arizona Republic archives. In the 1960s, about half of the voting-age population of the Navajo Nation were unable to vote for the same reason, Ferguson-Bohnee said.\n\nThose who did manage to pass the test and register to vote faced voter intimidation through the '50s and '60s, according to Berman.\n\n“Intimidation of minority-group members — Hispanics, African Americans as well as Native Americans — who wished to vote was … a fact of life in Arizona,” Berman wrote in the report.\n\nWhite voters would ask them to read and explain “literacy” cards with excerpts from the U.S. Constitution or spread false information, such as that voting would lead to increased taxation of native populations, hoping to “frighten or embarrass minorities and discourage them from standing in line to vote,” he said.\n\nTo make a bad situation worse, the now Republican-dominated Legislature decided to cleanse voting rolls, requiring all voting-age citizens to reregister.\n\nThe change wasn’t clearly communicated to Hispanic voters, Berman said, and it “erased years of registration drives in barrios across the state.”\n\nVoting Rights Act provides relief\n\nBy 1965, the fight against minority disenfranchisement was long underway. But it wasn’t until peaceful protesters in Selma, Alabama were attacked by state troopers, that the federal government started taking steps toward enacting legislation designed to dismantle discriminatory voting practices and ensure the enforcement of the 14th and 15th Amendments.\n\nThe resulting piece of legislation, the Voting Rights Act, was signed into law in 1965 — 55 years ago last month.\n\nThe law recognized that race-based voter suppression was more prominent in some areas of the country, so it created a formula to identify those areas and impose stricter remedies.\n\nAny state or locality that maintained a “test or device,” such as a literacy test, that restricted voting registration or voting and had a voter registration of less than 50% was subject to those remedies.\n\nThose jurisdictions were required suspend the use of their test and were subject to “preclearance,” meaning all changes to voting practices needed pre-approval from the federal government.\n\nFrom the start, Arizona was on that list. Three Arizona counties — Apache, Coconino and Navajo — fit the description, making Arizona one of only 11 states fully or partially covered under the 1965 formula.\n\nThe federal government amended and extended the special provisions for states with a history of discriminatory voting practices multiple times.\n\nAn amendment in 1970 also effectively created a nationwide ban on literacy tests, which Arizona promptly challenged. The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld the ban, pointing toward the “serious problem of deficient voter registration” among Latino, Black and Native American citizens in the state. Though, the state’s literacy ban wasn’t officially repealed until two years later.\n\nIn 1975, the entire state became covered after the federal government broadened the coverage formula to include discrimination against “language minority groups.” Only two other states — Texas and Alaska — also were covered in their entirety.\n\nSean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice, said preclearance through the VRA was arguably the most effective remedy against civil rights violations in the nation’s history.\n\n“It was amazingly effective at not only stopping bad and discriminatory practices from going into effect but actually stopped many jurisdictions from enacting these bad policies in the first place,” he said.\n\nIn the '80s and '90s, the U.S. Department of Justice blocked 17 proposed changes to voting practices in Arizona that they found to have a discriminatory effect or purpose on minority voters, with three related to statewide redistricting plans.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Bohnee-Ferguson said Native voters were turning out in record numbers. In 2000, three Native American representatives and one senator were elected to the state Legislature. Former Gov. Janet Napolitano credited her win in 2002 to the high turnout rates of Native Arizonans.\n\nNew wave of voter suppression\n\nDespite that progress, James Tucker, a pro bono voting rights counsel for the Native American Rights Fund and Voting Rights Act expert, said there’s an ongoing national movement to make it more difficult for minority voters to register and cast a ballot. And Arizona is no exception, he said.\n\n“People who are in power try to do everything to cling onto that, even when they aren’t the majority anymore,” Tucker said, alluding to the changing demographics in Arizona.\n\nOne of the most notorious issues for Latino and Native voters in Arizona in the past several decades was Proposition 200, the “Arizona Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act,” passed in 2004.\n\nEnacted as an effort to discourage illegal immigration, Tucker said Proposition 200 created a significant barrier for voting-age Latinos and Native Americans to participate in elections.\n\nThe measure required all in-person voters to produce a form of identification at the polling location and proof of citizenship. The result, Tucker said, was the disenfranchisement of Native and Latino voters, who by tradition or circumstance are less likely to have the forms of identification required to vote.\n\nOpponents challenged the requirements, citing their discriminatory effect, sparked years of legal battle. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the proof of citizenship requirement for voting in federal elections in 2013.\n\nThat same year, the U.S. Supreme Court decision retracted the section of the Voting Rights Act that created federal oversight for states, like Arizona, with a history of race-based voting discrimination. That created space for jurisdictions to pass laws that the Department of Justice may have objected to under preclearance.\n\nToday, language continues as a barrier for minority voters in the state.\n\nTranslations of voting material have repeatedly misrepresented or mistranslated key information, researchers say.\n\nThe 2012 official Spanish-language voter pamphlet in Maricopa County provided Spanish-speaking voters with the wrong election date. The same mistake was not made in the English-language version.\n\nFor Native communities, where many languages are historically unwritten, oral assistance is required to provide voters with the same election information. Though, there are many recorded instances of translations misrepresenting what is on the ballot or not enough poll workers to make the oral translations.\n\nTucker said counties that don’t provide adequate oral assistance to voters do so due to a “lack of resolve” as opposed to a lack of resources.\n\n“I think you’ll find in Arizona that there are some county recorders who do a really good job of working with the local tribes to make sure that they get those translations and have available poll workers who speak that language,” Tucker said. “But there are other counties in Arizona where that is simply not true.”\n\nReductions in polling locations in recent elections have also disproportionately affected minority voters.\n\nMaricopa County reduced its number of polling sites by 70% from 2012 to 2016, requiring Latino, Black and Native voters to travel greater distances to vote, according to the 9th Circuit decision from earlier this year.\n\nAnd strict voter ID laws, failure to provide translations of voter material and polling location closures are just a fraction of the ongoing barriers impacting minority voters, experts say.\n\nIn January, the 9th Circuit overturned two other laws — a 2016 ban on so-called “ballot harvesting” and the state’s policy of discarding provisional ballots of out-of-precinct voters — finding that they were enacted with discriminatory intent and disproportionately affect Latino, Black and Indigenous voters.\n\nArizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich challenged the ruling and the appeals court granted a stay, so the practices remain in place for now.\n\nEyes on the 2020 election\n\nGiven Arizona’s long history of race-based voter discrimination, voting rights advocates are on high alert for any discriminatory voting practices or policies, said Murphy Bannerman, deputy director of Election Protection Arizona, an organization dedicated to protecting voting rights and access in Arizona.\n\nFor the November election, she said they’re watching to ensure proper language assistance is provided, poll workers are educated on voter ID laws and all voters have access to both in-person and voting via mail.\n\nAnd as there are nationwide concerns about the infrastructure to accommodate mail-in voting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Native voting rights experts say tribal communities need to have access to in-person early and Election Day voting because many people voting on tribal land don’t have at-home mail delivery or pickup.\n\n“Lawmakers who are making these decisions need to be cognizant that not everyone has the same access to mail or the internet or traditional forms of identification,” Ferguson-Bohnee said.\n\nPeterson Zah says despite the ongoing fight to protect minority voting rights in the state, he’s hopeful knowing that the current generation of young people want to make their voices heard.\n\n“They’re not going to be deterred by some of those blocks that continue to be set up in front of them,” said Zah, who lives in Window Rock with his family. “They are going to do everything they can do to make sure that their rights are protected.”\n\nContact Grace Oldham on Twitter at @grace_c_oldham.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2021/04/30/arizona-election-audit-experts-call-federal-monitors/4897058001/", "title": "Arizona election audit: Experts call for federal monitors", "text": "Election security specialists with high-powered policy groups are calling for federal monitors to oversee the Arizona Senate's hand recount of 2.1 million ballots cast in Maricopa County.\n\nCiting violations of voting and election laws, representatives of the Brennan Center for Justice, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and Protect Democracy urged the Department of Justice to protect ballots and prevent voter intimidation.\n\n\"Ballots that are protected under federal law are in imminent danger of being stolen, defaced, or irretrievably damaged, and Arizona citizens are in imminent danger of being subject to unlawful voter intimidation,\" the four security specialists wrote in the April 29 letter.\n\nThe Senate and private contractors hired to conduct the recount failed to ensure the physical security of ballots by keeping doors unlocked and allowing unauthorized persons to access the ballot storage facility at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the specialists wrote.\n\n\"We believe that the Senate and its agents ... are violating their duty under federal law to retain and preserve ballots cast in a federal election,\" the specialists wrote. \"They also risk compromising the integrity of the ballots themselves, using materials and technologies that will cause the ballot paper and marks to deteriorate.\"\n\nArizona GOP Chair Kelli Ward lashed out at the request Friday on YouTube, saying it was a Democratic Party-led effort to derail the audit and wrest control of the election from state officials.\n\n\"Arizona is off limits to the federal government trampling on our constitutional rights and our sovereignty,\" Ward said. \"When it comes to managing our own election, we believe in the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nWard, who has promoted baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against former president Donald Trump, has championed the audit as a way to ensure election integrity in Arizona.\n\n\"We also do not want or need partisan attack dogs like the Brennan Center or Protect Democracy coming in to observe or interfere or undermine our elections and the Arizona State Senate Audit,\" Ward said. \"But they are coming with their lawyers, with their money and with their agenda to attempt to derail this full forensic audit that is being done by qualified experts.\"\n\nShe called the groups \"aggressive and dirty players\" who are \"working with BLM (Black Lives Matter) and Marxist groups to literally destroy our nation.\"\n\nThe letter to the DOJ was signed by Wendy Weiser and Hannah Klain at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law; Wade Henderson, CEO at The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; and Genevieve Nadeau, counsel at Protect Democracy.\n\nThe letter is addressed to Chris Herren, chief of the voting section of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division.\n\nThe election specialists warned that Cyber Ninjas, the Florida firm hired to lead the $150,000 audit, planned to knock on the doors of Maricopa County voters and collect information related to voter history.\n\n\"We are concerned ... the Senate and its agents are preparing to engage in conduct that will constitute unlawful voter intimidation in violation of the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws,\" the election specialists wrote.\n\nCyber Ninjas founder Doug Logan is a Trump supporter who has pushed unfounded election fraud claims as part of the \"Stop the Steal\" movement.

The audit is scheduled to end May 14, but Senate liaison Ken Bennett indicated it could be extended.

More than 22,000 people were surveyed in 2013 on issues such as whether the aging population poses a problem for their country and who is responsible for elderly care.\n\nMany countries are expected to face an increase in public pension and medical expenditure costs as their people age, and governments worry that a growing population dependent on a shrinking workforce will cause an economic slowdown, the report concludes.\n\nIn the USA, health care costs are set to double to almost 15% of the gross domestic product, partly because of aging and inflation, according to the report.\n\nConcern was highest in regions such as East Asia and parts of Europe, where the percentage of older people will be greater than other countries by 2050. Almost 90% of Japanese surveyed worried about the aging population, and half of those in Germany and Spain are worried, the survey found. On the opposite end, only 26% think the aging population is a major problem for the USA.\n\nPopulation growth between now and 2050 and a country's economic outlook dictated how anxious residents were about the effects of an aging population, said Rakesh Kochhar, the lead researcher on the study at the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"The growing number of older people in a country's population is believed to be less favorable to economic growth,\" Kochhar said. \"Less workers, … less output.\"\n\nAccording to a U.N. analysis of 60 years of Census data, the global population of those 65 and older is expected to triple to 1.5 billion by 2050. Paired with long-term declines in birth rates, more countries will have more adults 65 and older than children under 15.\n\n\"While the U.S. is aging, it's not at the same rate as the rest of the world,\" Kochhar said. \"Americans are more optimistic and least likely to say the growing number of older people is an issue.\"\n\nKochhar said immigration also plays a part. An influx of people coming to America could lessen the dependency of older people on younger workers.\n\nThe U.S. population is set to increase 89 million to almost 401 million people by 2050, while countries such as Japan, China, Germany and Spain will see declining populations, according to the report.\n\nIn 13 of the 21 countries surveyed, respondents said the government had a key responsibility in caring for the elderly. The U.S. is one of only four countries — joining South Korea, Germany and Britain — where more than one-third of those surveyed believed the elderly should be financially responsible for themselves. In the U.S. 46% said the elderly have responsibility for their own care.\n\nThat burden increasingly is falling on family members, according to Katie Sloan, executive director of the International Association of Home and Services for the Aging.\n\n\"Americans are pretty unprepared for their later years and particularly for the potential need for long-term services and support,\" Sloan said. \"As people live longer and Baby Boomers grow older, health care will increase enormously, and what is not well understood by the American public is the majority of those costs are largely borne by family members.\"\n\nKochhar said Americans are still a little burned from the recession.\n\n\"While the study reflects Americans optimism about the future, it's really a diminished finding compared to pre-recession surveys,\" Kochhar said. \"Confidence is high but not as high.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/26/asia/south-korea-worlds-lowest-fertility-rate-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "South Korea records world's lowest fertility rate – again | CNN", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nSouth Korea has broken its own record for the world’s lowest fertility rate, according to official figures released Wednesday, as the country struggles to reverse its years-long trend of declining births.\n\nThe country’s fertility rate, which indicates the average number of children a woman will have in her lifetime,sunk to 0.81 in 2021 – 0.03% lower than the previous year, according to government-run Statistics Korea.\n\nTo put that into perspective, the 2021 fertility rate was 1.6 in the United States and 1.3 in Japan, which also saw its lowest rate on record last year. In some African countries, where fertility rates are the highest in the world, the figure is 5 or 6.\n\nTo maintain a stable population, countries need a fertility rate of 2.1 – anything above that indicates population growth.\n\nSouth Korea’s birth rate has been dropping since 2015, and in 2020 the country recorded more deaths than births for the first time – meaning the number of inhabitants shrank, in what’s called a “population death cross.”\n\nAnd as fertility rates drop, South Korean women are also having babies later in life. The average age of women that gave birth in 2021 was 33.4 – 0.2 years older than the previous year, according to the statistics agency.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea’s population is also getting older, indicating a demographic decline that experts fear will leave the country with too few people of working age to support its burgeoning elderly population – both by paying taxes and filling jobs in fields such as health care and home assistance.\n\nAs of last November, 16.8% of South Koreans were over 65 years old, while just 11.8% were age 14 or under.\n\nThat proportion of elderly Koreans is rising rapidly – it increased by more than 5% between 2020 and 2021, according to census data. Meanwhile, the working age population – people between ages 15 and 64 – declined by 0.9% between 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn South Korea and Japan, there are similar reasons behind the decline in births – including demanding work cultures, stagnating wages, rising costs of living and skyrocketing housing prices.\n\nMany South Korean women say they just don’t have the time, money, or emotional capacity to go on dates as they put their career first in a highly competitive job market in which they often face a patriarchal culture and gender inequality.\n\nThe South Korean government has introduced several measures in recent years to tackle the falling fertility rate, including allowing both parents to take parental leave at the same time and extending paid paternal leave.\n\nSocial campaigns have encouraged men to take on a more active role in childcare and housework, and in some parts of the country, authorities are handing out “new baby vouchers” to encourage parents to have more children.", "authors": ["Gawon Bae Jessie Yeung", "Gawon Bae", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/health/elon-musk-population-collapse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk thinks the population will collapse. Demographers say it's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk tweeted, not for the first time, that “population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” Climate change is a serious problem facing the planet and experts say it’s difficult to compare problems.\n\nWhat is clear, demographers say, is that the global population is growing, despite declines in some parts of the world, and it shouldn’t be collapsing any time soon – even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past.\n\n“He’s better off making cars and engineering than at predicting the trajectory of the population,” said Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer and a former director of the United Nations Population Division, who has written several books about population issues.\n\n“Yes, some countries, their population is declining, but for the world, that’s just not the case.”\n\nPopulation projections by the numbers\n\nThe world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of this year, according to the United Nations. The UN predicts the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in just 8 years.\n\nBy 2080, the world’s population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion. Then there’s a 50% chance that the population will plateau or begin to decrease by 2100. More conservative models like the one published in 2020 in the Lancet anticipate the global population would be about 8.8 billion people by 2100.\n\nIt’s true that what’s driving current population growth is not a higher birth rate. What drives global population growth is that fewer people are dying young. Global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of nine years since 1990. That is expected to increase to 77.2 years by 2050.\n\nGlobally, the fertility rate has not “collapsed,” nor should it, according to the UN, but it has dropped significantly.\n\nIn 1950, women typically had five births each; globally, last year, it was 2.3 births. By 2050, the UN projects a further global decline to 2.1 births per woman.\n\nIn some countries, it is lower. In the US the 1950s, it was 3.6 births per woman, it slipped to 1.6 in 2020, according to the World Bank. In Italy, it was 1.2; in Japan, it was 1.3; in China, 1.2. In January 2022, the country announced the birth rate fell for the fifth year in a row, even with the repeal of the one child policy, allowing couples to have up to three children as of 2021.\n\n“Virtually every developed country is below two, and it’s been that way for 20 or 30 years,” Chamie said. Most countries have gone through what’s called a demographic transition.\n\nThe only continent that hasn’t finished this transition, he said, is parts of Africa, where there are 15 to 20 countries where the average number of children couples have is five. But in those countries, children still face high death rates. The infant mortality rate for kids under 5 is 8 to 10 times higher than in developed regions, and maternal mortality is more than double, Chamie said.\n\nIf women in these African regions had more access to contraception, education, and health care, these problems could be addressed and the global population could decline further – but people would be better off in terms of individual health.\n\nThe ‘gold medal’ century\n\nIn terms of population growth, the 20th century was an anomaly.\n\n“That century was the most impressive demographic century ever. It had more gold medals than all the other centuries,” Charmie said.\n\nThe human population nearly quadrupled, something that had never happened before in recorded history. That’s largely because of improvements in public health.\n\nThe world has antibiotics, vaccines, public health programs and improved sanitation to thank for people living longer and more mothers and children surviving birth.\n\nWith contraception, especially in 1964, when the oral pill was widely introduced in the US, couples were now better able to determine when and how many children they had.\n\n“Contraception, the oral pill had a much more significant effect on the world than the car,” Charmie said.\n\nAs more women got an education, worked outside the home and got a later start on children in many countries with access to contraception, couples had fewer children and the population started to decline.\n\nIn 2020, the global population growth rate fell under 1% for the first time since 1950.\n\nThe picture in the US\n\nIn the US, the fertility rate is down in part due to what Ken Johnson, a senior demographer at the Casey School of Public Poilcy and a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, characterized as a “significant” decline in teen births.\n\n“Most demographers would see that as a good thing,” he said.\n\nHe said the other driver was a decline in the number of births to women in their 20s. That trend has been around since 2008. People put off or decided not to have babies in part because of the recession, he said. Covid then exacerbated this trend.\n\nBetween July of 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of the US population was the lowest it’s been in probably 100 years he said.\n\n“Is it a collapse of the number of births? No, I wouldn’t say that,” Johnson said.\n\nHe said there are a few factors at play in the low US growth rate: fewer births, fewer immigrants due to Trump-era policies, and more deaths as the US population is ages. Covid-19 contributed to higher deaths, too.\n\n“It’s almost like a perfect storm if you will,” Johnson said. “Births are way down, Covid pushes deaths way up, and then immigration is quite slow, too, so it is no wonder that the population growth rate is so low when you bring all those factors together at the same time.”\n\nPreventing population problems down the road\n\nAs the population ages and birth rates decline in some areas of the globe, that could put strain on social systems.\n\nThe share of the population over age 65 will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. That’s twice the number of kids under age 5.\n\nGlobally, the trick to make such a population age imbalance work, is that governments will need to be proactive, the UN says. Countries with aging populations need to adapt public programs that will support this growing population of older people. That means shoring up programs like social security, pensions and establishing universal access to health care and long-term care.\n\nIn the US, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with Brookings Metro, said he doesn’t see the need for more couples to have more babies to address the age imbalance in the United States. Policies that would support couples that want children – affordable daycare and family leave policies, for example – could help, but that that hasn’t made a big difference in terms of fertility rates.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFertility is below the replacement rate in the US, meaning couples are having fewer than two children each, but the rate is not as low as it is in most of Europe, he said.\n\n“I don’t think in the US it’s an issue of collapse, because we can certainly open the faucet for more immigrants anytime we want to,” Frey said. “We’ll have no paucity of people who want to come through the door to immigrate here in the future. Immigrants and their children are younger than the population as a whole and so that will help to keep the population from aging as well.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/25/health/seniors-major-surgery-khn-partner/index.html", "title": "Research helps seniors make informed decisions about risks ...", "text": "Nearly 1 in 7 older adults die within a year of undergoing major surgery, according to an important new study that sheds much-needed light on the risks seniors face when having invasive procedures.\n\nEspecially vulnerable are older patients with probable dementia (33% die within a year) and frailty (28%), as well as those having emergency surgeries (22%). Advanced age also amplifies risk: Patients who were 90 or older were six times as likely to die than those ages 65 to 69.\n\nThe study in JAMA Surgery, published by researchers at Yale School of Medicine, addresses a notable gap in research: Though patients 65 and older undergo nearly 40% of all surgeries in the U.S., detailed national data about the outcomes of these procedures has been largely missing.\n\n“As a field, we’ve been really remiss in not understanding long-term surgical outcomes for older adults,” said Dr. Zara Cooper, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and the director of the Center for Geriatric Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nOf particular importance is information about how many seniors die, develop disabilities, can no longer live independently, or have a significantly worsened quality of life after major surgery.\n\n“What older patients want to know is, ‘What’s my life going to look like?’” Cooper said. “But we haven’t been able to answer with data of this quality before.”\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Thomas Gill and Yale colleagues examined claims data from traditional Medicare and survey data from the National Health and Aging Trends study spanning 2011 to 2017. (Data from private Medicare Advantage plans was not available at that time but will be included in future studies.)\n\nInvasive procedures that take place in operating rooms with patients under general anesthesia were counted as major surgeries. Examples include procedures to replace broken hips, improve blood flow in the heart, excise cancer from the colon, remove gallbladders, fix leaky heart valves, and repair hernias, among many more.\n\nOlder adults tend to experience more problems after surgery if they have chronic conditions such as heart or kidney disease; if they are already weak or have difficulty moving around; if their ability to care for themselves is compromised; and if they have cognitive problems, noted Gill, a professor of medicine, epidemiology, and investigative medicine at Yale.\n\nTwo years ago, Gill’s team conducted research that showed 1 in 3 older adults had not returned to their baseline level of functioning six months after major surgery. Most likely to recover were seniors who had elective surgeries for which they could prepare in advance.\n\nIn another study, published last year in the Annals of Surgery, his team found that about 1 million major surgeries occur in individuals 65 and older each year, including a significant number near the end of life. Remarkably, data documenting the extent of surgery in the older population has been lacking until now.\n\n“This opens up all kinds of questions: Were these surgeries done for a good reason? How is appropriate surgery defined? Were the decisions to perform surgery made after eliciting the patient’s priorities and determining whether surgery would achieve them?” said Dr. Clifford Ko, a professor of surgery at UCLA School of Medicine and director of the Division of Research and Optimal Patient Care at the American College of Surgeons.\n\nAs an example of this kind of decision-making, Ko described a patient who, at 93, learned he had early-stage colon cancer on top of preexisting liver, heart, and lung disease. After an in-depth discussion and being told that the risk of poor results was high, the patient decided against invasive treatment.\n\n“He decided he would rather take the risk of a slow-growing cancer than deal with a major operation and the risk of complications,” Ko said.\n\nStill, most patients choose surgery. Dr. Marcia Russell, a staff surgeon at the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, described a 90-year-old patient who recently learned he had colon cancer during a prolonged hospital stay for pneumonia. “We talked with him about surgery, and his goals are to live as long as possible,” said Russell. To help prepare the patient, now recovering at home, for future surgery, she recommended he undertake physical therapy and eat more high-protein foods, measures that should help him get stronger.\n\n“He may need six to eight weeks to get ready for surgery, but he’s motivated to improve,” Russell said.\n\nThe choices older Americans make about undergoing major surgery will have broad societal implications. As the 65-plus population expands, “covering surgery is going to be fiscally challenging for Medicare,” noted Dr. Robert Becher, an assistant professor of surgery at Yale and a research collaborator with Gill. Just over half of Medicare spending is devoted to inpatient and outpatient surgical care, according to a 2020 analysis.\n\nWhat’s more, “nearly every surgical subspecialty is going to experience workforce shortages in the coming years,” Becher said, noting that in 2033, there will be nearly 30,000 fewer surgeons than needed to meet expected demand.\n\nThese trends make efforts to improve surgical outcomes for older adults even more critical. Yet progress has been slow. The American College of Surgeons launched a major quality improvement program in July 2019, eight months before the covid-19 pandemic hit. It requires hospitals to meet 30 standards to achieve recognized expertise in geriatric surgery. So far, fewer than 100 of the thousands of hospitals eligible are participating.\n\nOne of the most advanced systems in the country, the Center for Geriatric Surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, illustrates what’s possible. There, older adults who are candidates for surgery are screened for frailty. Those judged to be frail consult with a geriatrician, undergo a thorough geriatric assessment, and meet with a nurse who will help coordinate care after discharge.\n\nAlso initiated are “geriatric-friendly” orders for post-surgery hospital care. This includes assessing older patients three times a day for delirium (an acute change in mental status that often afflicts older hospital patients), getting patients moving as soon as possible, and using non-narcotic pain relievers. “The goal is to minimize the harms of hospitalization,” said Cooper, who directs the effort.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nShe told me about a recent patient, whom she described as a “social woman in her early 80s who was still wearing skinny jeans and going to cocktail parties.” This woman came to the emergency room with acute diverticulitis and delirium; a geriatrician was called in before surgery to help manage her medications and sleep-wake cycle, and recommend non-pharmaceutical interventions.\n\nWith the help of family members who visited this patient in the hospital and have remained involved in her care, “she’s doing great,” Cooper said. “It’s the kind of outcome we work very hard to achieve.”", "authors": ["Judith Graham"], "publish_date": "2022/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/03/01/birth-rate-in-japan-record-low/72779326007/", "title": "Fewer marriages, babies push Japan birth rate to lowest since 1899", "text": "Japan's birth rate is the lowest it has ever been since the country first collected the statistic in 1899.

Respondents said the burden of childbirth and parenting were a reason they had no interest in having kids, along with economic concerns.\n\nA high cost of living that's outpacing pay increases is one reason why young Japanese adults are not interested in becoming parents, the survey found. Bleak job prospects and intense corporate cultures are also discouraging to young adults who are in their child-bearing years.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida previously called the low births “the biggest crisis Japan faces,” and put forward a package of measures that have included more support and subsidies mostly for childbirth, children and their families.\n\nHow will a declining birth rate impact Japan?\n\nJapan’s population is expected to decrease about 30% to 87 million by 2070, with four out of every 10 people aged 65 or older, the AP reported.\n\nAn aging and declining population is a cause for concern over national security issues and can cause economic challenges for the country.\n\nWhat other countries have a declining birth rate?\n\nChina and South Korea also face a declining birth rate: The average number of expected babies for a birthing person in South Korea fell to a record low of 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, according to data from Statistics Korea.\n\nThe U.S. faced a declining birth rate as well: Between 2007 and 2022, the birth rate fell from 14.3 births per 1,000 people to 11.1, or nearly 23%, according to the CDC.

It was the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.\n\nMore than 300,000 people living near the nuclear plant were forced to temporarily evacuate and thousands more did so voluntarily. Once-bustling communities were turned into ghost towns.\n\nIn the years since, large-scale cleanup and decontamination operations have allowed some residents who once lived in the former exclusion zone to return.\n\nOn Sunday, Iwayama watched as a gate blocking access to his home in Katsurao’s Noyuki district was reopened at 8 a.m. local time. Evacuation orders for most of the village were lifted in June 2016, allowing registered residents to come and go, said a village official, who declined to be identified as is customary in Japan. Most who have returned since 2016 are senior citizens.\n\nSome households however, are still waiting for their sections of the village to be decontaminated, according to the official.\n\nDecontamination work near an elementary school in Katsurao, near the tsunami-crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, on December 4, 2011. Kyodo/Reuters\n\nJapan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said this month the opening would be the first time residents were allowed to live again in Katsurao’s Noyuki district, dubbed the “difficult-to-return” zone, an area with high levels of radiation up to 50 millisieverts.\n\nInternational safety watchdogs recommend annual doses of radiation are kept below 20 millisieverts, the equivalent of two full-body CT scans.\n\nThe Japanese government concluded that radiation levels had fallen sufficiently for residents to return, though the figure hasn’t been released.\n\nFor now, just four households out of 30 said they intend to return to the Noyuki district, said the village official.\n\nBefore the disaster, Katsurao village had a population of around 1,500 people. Many of those who left have rebuilt their lives elsewhere, the official said.\n\nOthers may still have concerns about radiation. Despite the decontamination efforts, a 2020 survey conducted by Kwansei Gakuin University found 65% of evacuees no longer wanted to return to Fukushima prefecture – 46% feared residual contamination and 45% had settled elsewhere.\n\nAs of March 2020, only 2.4% of Fukushima prefecture remained off-limits to residents, with even parts of that area accessible for short visits, according to Japan’s Ministry of Environment.\n\nBut there remains more work to be done.\n\nThe Katsurao village official said about 337 square kilometers of land in seven Fukushima municipalities are deemed “difficult-to-return” zones. Of those, just 27 square kilometers in six of the same municipalities are specified reconstruction zones.\n\n“This means that more work is needed and other families are waiting for the areas they used to live in to be decontaminated and restored to normal,” he said.\n\nLater this month, restrictions are expected to be partially lifted on Futaba and neighboring Okuma – towns home to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant – and a similar easing is scheduled in a further three municipalities in 2023, the official said. He added that a timeline for areas outside the reconstruction bases has not been decided.\n\n“This is one milestone,” Hiroshi Shinoki, the mayor of Katsurao village, told reporters on Sunday. “It is our duty to try and bring things back as much as we can to how they were 11 years ago.”\n\nShinoki said that he wanted to revitalize local agriculture – a key industry in the area – to entice residents back.\n\nIn recent years, countries have gradually eased import bans on produce from Fukushima prefecture.

Factors behind the trend include the country’s demographic crisis, gaps in social welfare, poverty and social isolation – all of which have become more pronounced since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast year, the country recorded 3,378 such deaths, up from 2,412 in 2017, according to a report released last Wednesday by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.\n\nThe ministry’s report was the first since the government enacted the Lonely Death Prevention and Management Act in 2021, under which updates are required every five years to help establish “policies to prevent lonely deaths.”\n\nStaff at a non-profit organization, which holds funerals for those who died \"lonely deaths,\" move a coffin at a crematorium in Goyang, South Korea, on June 16, 2016.

People in their 20s and 30s accounted for 6% to 8%.\n\nThe report did not go into possible causes. But the phenomenon has been studied for years as authorities try to understand what drives these lonely deaths, and how to better support vulnerable people.\n\n“In preparation for a super-aged society, it is necessary to actively respond to lonely deaths,” said South Korea’s legislative research body in a news release earlier this year, adding that the government’s priority was to “quickly identify cases of social isolation.”\n\nElderly in poverty\n\nSouth Korea is one of several Asian countries – including Japan and China – facing demographic decline, with people having fewer babies and giving birth later in life.\n\nThe country’s birth rate has been dropping steadily since 2015, with experts blaming various factors such as demanding work culture, rising costs of living, and stagnating wages for putting people off parenthood. At the same time, the work force is shrinking, raising fears there won’t be enough workers to support the ballooning elderly population in fields such as health care and home assistance.\n\nSome of the consequences of this skewed age distribution are becoming apparent, with millions of aging residents struggling to survive on their own.\n\nAs of 2016, more than 43% of Koreans aged over 65 were under the poverty line, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development – more than three times the national average of other OECD countries.\n\nThe lives of middle-aged and elderly Koreans “rapidly deteriorate” if they are excluded from the labor and housing markets and this is “a major cause of death,” Song In-joo, senior research fellow at the Seoul Welfare Center, wrote in a 2021 study about lonely deaths.\n\nThe study analyzed nine lonely death cases, and conducted in-depth interviews with their neighbors, landlords and case workers.\n\nA volunteer pastor prays before a makeshift shrine for two people who died \"lonely deaths,\" inside the waiting room of a crematoriumon on July 4, 2016 in Goyang, South Korea.

He had no education, family or even a cell phone. In another case, an 88-year-old woman suffered financial hardship following the death of her son. She died after the elderly welfare center she attended, which provided free meals, closed at the onset of the pandemic.\n\n“The difficulties expressed before death by those at risk of dying alone were health problems, economic difficulties, disconnection and rejection, and difficulties in managing daily life,” Song wrote.\n\nCompounding factors included delayed government assistance and a “lack of at-home care” for those with serious or chronic illness.\n\nThe findings of the 2021 study were echoed in the Ministry of Health and Welfare report, which said many of those at risk found their life satisfaction “rapidly declining due to job loss and divorce” – especially if they were “unfamiliar with heath care and housework.”\n\nMany of the people in the 2021 study lived in cramped, dingy spaces such as subdivided apartments known as jjokbang, where residents often share communal facilities, and basement apartments known as banjiha, which made headlines earlier this year when a family was trapped and drowned during record rainfall in Seoul.\n\nIn major cities like Seoul, the notoriously expensive housing market means these apartments are some of the most affordable options available. And apart from the poor living conditions, they also carry the risk of further isolation; these housing structures “have already been criticized as slums … and are also stigmatized,” with many residents living “anonymous” lives, said the 2021 study.\n\n“It’s concerning because the (housing concentration) of lonely deaths could be another characteristic of the poverty subculture,” Song wrote.\n\nClosing the gaps\n\nRising public concern over lonely deaths has prompted various regional and national initiatives over the years.\n\nIn 2018, the Seoulmetropolitangovernment announced a “neighborhood watcher” program, in which community members pay visits to single-person households in vulnerable areas such as basement apartments and subdivided housing, according to news agency Yonhap.\n\nUnder this plan, hospitals, landlords and convenience store staff play the role of “watchmen,” notifying community workers when patients or regular customers are not seen for a long time, or when rent and other fees go unpaid.\n\nSeveral cities, including Seoul, Ulsan and Jeonju, have rolled out mobile apps for those living alone, which automatically send a message to an emergency contact if the phone is inactive for a period of time.\n\nOther organizations such as churches and nonprofits have also stepped up outreach services and community events – as well as handling funeral rites for the deceased who have nobody left to claim or mourn them.\n\nThe Lonely Death Prevention and Management Act passed last year was the latest and most sweeping measure yet, ordering local governments to set up policies to identify and assist residents at risk. Apart from establishing the five-yearly situation report, it also required the government to write up a comprehensive preventative plan, which is still in the works.\n\nStaff and a volunteer Buddhist nun of a nonprofit organization carry the name tablets of people who died \"lonely deaths\" at a crematorium on June 16, 2016 in Goyang, South Korea.

He did not give a timeline, but said once the facility is authorized, the company expects to deliver 8 million doses weekly by the end of the month.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a third of Americans have gotten at least one shot, and more than a quarter of American adults are now fully vaccinated, data released through the CDC shows. About one-fifth of all Americans have been fully vaccinated.\n\nBut with an increase in new cases and hospitalizations, Zients warned Friday that \"all of us need to keep up our guard.\"\n\nNorth Carolina sites halt Johnson & Johnson shots after adverse reactions\n\nNorth Carolina health officials said on Thursday that they stopped administering Johnson & Johnson doses at a mass vaccination site in Raleigh and at clinics in Hillsborough and Chapel Hill after at least 26 people experienced adverse reactions, including fainting.\n\nFour people were taken to hospitals for further examination, and state and federal health officials are reviewing the matter. In Colorado on Wednesday, 11 people saw adverse reactions after receiving a J&J shot. Two of those individuals were taken to a hospital.\n\nCDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said it is aware of adverse reactions in some people who received the vaccine shots in Iowa, Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina. Those reactions include dizziness, light headedness, feeling faint and rapid breathing.\n\n“COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective,” she said. “Many people don’t have any side effects after COVID-19 vaccines, but some people will have pain or swelling at the injection site or fever, chills, or a headache. These typically don’t last long and are signs that your body is building protection.”\n\nCouple in their 90s reunite after more than a year to celebrate their 72nd anniversary\n\nVirginia Byrne, 95, spent more than a year apart from her husband Jack, 94, due to coronavirus restrictions as he lives in a memory care facility.\n\nThe couple reunited March 19 at the assisted living facility where Jack resides in St. Louis, Missouri to celebrate their 72nd anniversary.\n\n“The lights went on again in my life, because I was able to be so close to my husband for the first time in more than a year,” Virginia Byrne told ABC. “It was a wonderful moment. I could hardly let go.\"\n\nVariant cases more than triple in some states\n\nThe CDC reported nearly 3,400 coronavirus variant cases late Thursday, showing some states had more than tripled their tallies of dangerous mutated viruses just in the last week.\n\nThe United States now has 20,412 known variant cases and seven states, including Georgia, Colorado and California, have reported at least 1,000 cases. A week ago, only two states had reached that mark. Seven states have now reported at least 1,000 cases; a week ago, only two had reached that mark.\n\nMeanwhile, Michigan and Minnesota each reported more than 600 variant cases on Thursday, with Minnesota nearly tripling its known variant case count this week alone, and Michigan up 83% in the week.\n\n– Mike Stucka\n\n1 in 3 COVID-19 survivors diagnosed with brain or mental health disorder study finds\n\nA massive study conducted during the pandemic estimates 1 in 3 COVID-19 survivors were diagnosed with a neurological or psychiatric condition within six months of infection.\n\nThe study, published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet Psychiatry, used more than 230,000 electronic health records of COVID-19 patients mostly in the U.S. looking at 14 different brain and mental health disorders.\n\nThirty-four percent of survivors were diagnosed with at least one of these conditions, with 13% of these people being their first recorded neurological or psychiatric diagnosis. Mental health diagnoses were most common among patients, with 17% diagnosed with anxiety and 14% diagnosed with a mood disorder.\n\nAlthough neurological diagnoses were more uncommon, they were more prevalent in patients who had been seriously ill during a COVID-19 infection. For example, 7% of patients who were admitted to intensive care had a stroke and 2% were diagnosed with dementia.\n\n- Adrianna Rodriguez\n\nIf UK is any sign, vaccines may blunt impact of spring surge in US\n\nWednesday's announcement by the CDC that the highly transmissible coronavirus variant first identified in Britain is now the dominant strain in the U.S. carries ominous implications, but recent developments in the United Kingdom offer a ray of hope.\n\nResearchers at Imperial College London found that COVID-19 infections dropped about 60% in March as national lockdown measures slowed the spread of the virus. People 65 and older were least likely to be infected as they benefited most from the vaccination program, which initially focused on older people.\n\nThe study also found that the relationship between infections and deaths is diverging, “suggesting that infections may have resulted in fewer hospitalizations and deaths since the start of widespread vaccination.”\n\nIn the U.S., even though infections have increased by 14% over the last two weeks, the rate of hospitalizations is only up 5% and reported deaths – which typically lag by about four weeks – are down 31%, according to the New York Times tracker.\n\nThe U.S. trails only Britain among large countries in the number of vaccine doses administered per 100 people, 55-51. By comparison, France is at a little under 19. The U.S. has also given at least one vaccine shot to 75% of its population age 65 and older, which is most vulnerable to the virus.\n\nThat suggests the spring surge so many health experts are dreading won't be as brutal as the one in the winter, which was capped by a record 95,000-plus deaths in January.\n\n\"It's almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase,'' presidential adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Wednesday.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/04/21/coronavirus-pinatas-cathartic-effigy-immigration-limbo-news-around-states/115724128/", "title": "Coronavirus pinatas, cathartic effigy: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Hospitalizations linked to COVID-19 have jumped about 20% in less than two weeks in the state, a trend that health officials said Tuesday they were monitoring but don’t consider a sign of another coming crisis in the pandemic. Statistics from the Alabama Department of Public Health showed 362 people were hospitalized Monday for the illness caused by the coronavirus. Though up from the 301 patients just 10 days earlier, the total was still just a fraction of the 3,070 patients who pushed the state’s intensive care wards to near-capacity in mid-January. The increase in cases is concerning but doesn’t immediately threaten the state’s health care system because the number of people being treated remains far below levels from earlier this year, said Dr. Don Williamson, chief executive of the Alabama Hospital Association. Also, he said, a major spike in the number of severely ill patients isn’t expected because more and more people are being vaccinated, and increasing numbers of patients are young people, who tend to fare better than older patients with health complications. “It’s nothing dramatic, but it’s something we need to be aware is happening,” said Williamson, who previously served as state health officer.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: When the pandemic began last year, Carolina Tolladay Vidal’s pinata business went to pieces. “Many of the projects I had were moved to other dates,” she told Alaska Public Media. “Many were canceled.” She had to find fresh ideas to rejuvenate her business and settled on making large, coronavirus-shaped pinatas. After Tolladay Vidal posted a photograph of one of the homemade virus pinatas on social media, the orders started piling up, she said. “I think you really smash them and break them and hit them with meaning,” she said. “Because it has been tough for everybody.” Tolladay Vidal – who started her pinata business about four years ago to make a custom design for one of her daughters – grew up in Mexico, spending years creating pinatas with her family. Rose Consenstein, age 8, said she felt like “beating the heck” out of a coronavirus pinata at her birthday party. “I couldn’t see it, since I had a blindfold,” Rose said. “But I was just like, ‘I want to get you!’ ” Her mom, Kate Consenstein, said it was the perfect addition to her daughter’s outdoor, socially distanced party. “Coronavirus is the perfect villain for children,” Consenstein said. “They can really just simply understand that that is the thing that we want to defeat. There was so much cheering when it exploded.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey used his executive powers Monday to prohibit local and regional governments from making so-called vaccine passports a requirement for people to enter businesses or get services, calling it an encroachment on private medical information. The Republican governor signed an executive order that also bans state agencies or businesses that contract with state government from requiring proof that people have been inoculated against COVID-19. Businesses that decide they want to require vaccine passports – along with health care providers, child care facilities, schools and universities – are exempted from the ban. Later on Monday, Ducey rescinded his executive order from July that directed K-12 schools to require face masks. The move punts decisions about masking to K-12 school districts and charter schools. He said he made the decision “in alignment” with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that guidance says the “universal and correct use of masks” is essential to safe in-person schooling. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman, a Democrat, said the decision destabilizes schools during an already challenging year.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 59 new coronavirus cases Monday and five more deaths from the illness it causes. The Department of Health said the state’s virus cases since the pandemic began now total 333,511, and its COVID-19 deaths total 5,699. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, dropped by 121 to 1,789. COVID-19 hospitalizations in Arkansas rose by three to 164. Nearly 6,500 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered. More than 1.5 million of the 2.2 million vaccine doses allocated to the state have been given so far. More than 626,000 residents have been fully immunized, the department said. “Our combined efforts are keeping the numbers low, but we will lose momentum if we do not increase our vaccination numbers,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers on Monday revived a multibillion-dollar tax break for some businesses after the Biden administration assured them the proposal would not jeopardize the state’s own federal coronavirus aid. The U.S. government has given California companies about $97 billion in loans during the pandemic, the majority of which owners won’t have to pay back. Congress already lets business owners deduct expenses associated with those loans from their federal taxes. But California business owners still owe state taxes on that money. Lawmakers wanted to change that and were prepared to follow through earlier this year. But they put it off because they were afraid the proposal could force them to lose some of their own federal pandemic relief money, given that Congress barred states from using the aid to pay for tax cuts. Since the proposal would reduce how much money business owners pay in state taxes, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration worried it would count as a tax cut and put some of the state’s $26 billion at risk. The U.S. Treasury Department assured the state it could pass the bill without forfeiting the aid. The state Senate voted 37-0 on Monday to do just that. The bill now heads to the state Assembly, where Speaker Anthony Rendon called it “one of the biggest proposed tax cuts in California history.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: A public health report found a vaccine clinic operating without proper temperature storage or social distancing, as well as unmasked workers. The Associated Press received the report on the Dr. Moma Health and Wellness Clinic by an El Paso County public health employee in response to a records request. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment stopped vaccinations at the site after nearly 4,000 people got one or more doses of Pfizer’s or Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines at the facility. “None of the people in the room were wearing masks. On the desk there were several silver trays loaded with filled syringes in a pile and a bowl with vaccine in it,” the report says. “I did not see any temp logs or vaccine coolers/fridges. There were no labels on any of the syringes.” The aesthetic day spa, Dr. Moma Health and Wellness Clinic, is run by Sylvienash Moma, who has a doctor of nursing practice degree, according to her website. That degree includes advanced training in nursing skills and disciplines. The El Paso public health employee visited the clinic April 9 after receiving phone calls and emails with concerns and complaints. The employee described the clinic’s operations as “very confusing and chaotic” and said: “At one point I assisted with traffic control.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to phase out many pandemic restrictions affecting businesses next month, including long-shuttered bars, while keeping the mandatory indoor mask-wearing rules in place for now, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday. The announcement came as the state surpassed 8,000 COVID-19-associated deaths. Beginning May 1, outdoor restrictions will be lifted on businesses, such as wearing masks when social distancing can’t be observed. Also, the rule that alcohol can’t be served without food will be lifted, essentially allowing outdoor bar service. Table seating outdoors will no longer be limited to eight people, and business curfews will be moved back from 11 p.m. to midnight, giving restaurants an opportunity to have a second seating and putting Connecticut on par with New York. “I think these are all ways we have earned the right to get back to our new normal,” said Lamont, who urged people to still “continue to be cautious with the mask.” Beginning May 19, indoor bars that don’t serve food will be allowed to reopen, and all remaining business restrictions will end, including capacity limits on movie theaters and outdoor gatherings. Lamont said he expects the state will issue guidance, but it will essentially be left up to businesses to decide what safety measures to keep.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: About 4,000 applications for visas and other necessary paperwork for immigrants are waiting to be processed at the state’s only Application Support Center due to reduced hours and staffing shortages resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some immigrants have lost their jobs, health insurance, driver’s licenses and maternity benefits due to their visas expiring while they awaited an appointment to submit their fingerprints, photographs and signatures. That set of information, also known as biometrics, is a necessary step for immigrants to renew their visas, adjust their status, continue the green card process and receive an employment authorization document. The Application Support Center, based in Dover, is run by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and is the only center in the country still operating at reduced hours since November 2020. It’s open only from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays, giving applicants a weekly eight-hour window to have their appointments scheduled by USCIS. After hearing from a rising number of affected residents who contacted her office, U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., announced last week that the Dover center would fully reopen May 3 and begin processing the backlog with help from the Biden administration and Homeland Security Department.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Monday that D.C. will resume enforcement of all parking restrictions starting June 1 after almost a year of suspending driving regulations and requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, WUSA-TV reports. That will include all parking enforcement; towing of vehicles violating parking zones, plus associated fees; street sweeping enforcement; display of valid D.C. registration and inspection stickers; and new tiered residential parking permit fees. Parking, photo and minor moving violation tickets issued after June 1 will be subject to adjudication hearing timelines listed on the back of the ticket. Starting July 1, the district will resume booting of vehicles with two or more unsatisfied tickets that are 60 days old; all D.C. driver’s license and ID cardholders must display the valid credential; renewal applications will be accepted for occupational and professional licenses; and medical cannabis program or caregiver registration cards must have a valid expiration date. The D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles will have appointments available for residents to get their registration or identification issues up to date. They can also apply for a four-month ticket amnesty program to give them time to pay for tickets on their vehicle and registration.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Continuing what appears to be a national trend, women in the Sunshine State are choosing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 at higher rates than men – and medical professionals aren’t surprised. Statewide as of Wednesday, women made up about 57% of fully vaccinated people, according to the Florida Department of Health. Women make up 51% of Florida’s population as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. One reason for the gap between the sexes is that women are more likely to seek out preventive care than men, according to Arch Mainous, a health services researcher at the University of Florida. Mainous also said women in Florida make up a large part of the workforces that were prioritized for vaccines. For instance, women hold about 76% of all health care jobs, according to a 2019 analysis by the U.S. Census Bureau. But another possible reason affecting people’s decisions is Florida’s limited, targeted messaging, said Kartik Cherabuddi, another UF professor. State officials aimed vaccine rollout messages toward vulnerable populations like older Americans, people who are immunocompromised and caregivers, he said. Since more women tend to be caregivers, they are getting vaccinated to take care of not just themselves but their loved ones as well, he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Five private colleges in the area will require students to get COVID-19 vaccinations before class begins next fall. Emory University, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, the Morehouse School of Medicine and Spelman College made the announcement Monday. The five join dozens of colleges and universities that have made the decision nationwide, although they are among the first in the South to make the move. Emory President Gregory Fenves said in a statement that vaccinations will make it healthier for students to be in full classrooms and to take part in athletics and performance events. He said the university will also continue to use masks and testing to contain the spread of the coronavirus, though students with medical conditions or “strong personal objections” can apply for an exemption. Emory is Georgia’s largest private university, with 15,000 students. The university and its health system is one of metro Atlanta’s largest employers. The four historically Black institutions that made the announcement are all part of the Atlanta University Center, a consortium of colleges that share resources and allow students to cross-register for classes. They are requiring employees as well as students to be vaccinated.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: As vaccine eligibility has finally expanded to all residents 16 and up across the state, demand has fallen everywhere but Oahu, Hawaii News Now reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Voters will get the chance to decide whether lawmakers in the part-time Legislature will be able to call special sessions, a power currently limited to governors. The state House voted 54-15 on Tuesday to clear the two-thirds threshold needed for proposed constitutional amendments. The resolution has already passed the Senate. The measure will go before voters in November 2022, needing a simple majority. The Idaho Legislature typically meets from January through March before adjourning for the rest of the year. Backers said the Legislature isn’t an equal branch of government without the power to call itself back into session. Opponents said that allowing lawmakers to call special sessions could lead to the Legislature becoming full time. If voters approve, the Legislature could call itself back into session if 60% of lawmakers in each the House and Senate agree. The special session would be limited to specific topics agreed to by lawmakers beforehand. Republican Rep. Jason Monks, during debate on the House floor, said lawmakers once in a special session could also consider additional topics if 60% of the House and Senate members agreed. Based on the joint resolution’s language, that would appear to have the effect of creating another special session to address a new topic.\n\nIllinois\n\nJacksonville: Illinois College will hold an in-person commencement for its graduates, though parents, friends and other guests will have to watch remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A news release from the school indicated the decision to limit the event to just students was “a difficult one” made between college administration and student leaders from the class of 2021. Typically, commencement week activities can attract about 1,000 people from all over the world. Graduates will receive their diplomas during a senior celebration at King Fieldhouse in Bruner Fitness and Recreation Center on May 11. The ceremony will be livestreamed. On May 16, the traditional baccalaureate service will premiere at 11 a.m. including readings, musical performances and comments by members of the graduating class. At 1 p.m., viewers can tune in to the commencement ceremony as degrees are officially conferred upon the class of 2021. Last month, University of Illinois Springfield officials announced students would be given the option of having an in-person “stage experience” days before its May 15 virtual commencement celebration. UIS graduates who opt for that will be allowed up to four guests in the audience, and the ceremony will be livestreamed on the UIS website for guests to watch.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Legislative negotiators have reached an agreement on limiting the authority of county or city health departments by allowing local elected officials to overturn orders or enforcement actions issued during emergencies. Republican supporters say the proposal is meant to provide a “check and balance” protecting the rights of business owners following complaints about COVID-19 orders closing or limiting businesses that have been imposed over the past year. The agreement released Tuesday requires any local public health order that is more stringent than one issued by the governor to be approved by an elected county or city board. The deal also creates a procedure allowing the public to appeal enforcement actions such as citations, fines or an order to close a business. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb has said he was concerned about the proposed limitations on local health officials and would “take a hard look” at the bill. The governor’s office didn’t immediately reply Tuesday to a request for comment. Legislative Republicans voted last week to override Holcomb’s veto on a bill giving themselves more authority to intervene during statewide emergencies declared by the governor. The Senate and House are expected to vote Wednesday on final legislative approval for the bill.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A top workplace safety regulator warned the Republican leaders of the Legislature that conditions inside the state Capitol are hazardous and may be exposing workers to the coronavirus, according to documents released Monday. Russell Perry, administrator of the Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration, warned in a “hazard alert letter” dated April 13 that an inspection by his agency raised concerns for the potential of worker illnesses tied to the exposure. Perry wrote that social distancing is not always practiced or enforced inside the building, temperature checks and health screens are not performed on everyone entering, and employees are not required to report positive tests to legislative leaders under their policy. In addition, cases that are reported are not examined to determine whether they were work-related. Perry wrote that the conditions do not amount to a violation of Iowa law but “may expose workers to COVID-19 hazards.” He asked Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, Senate President Jake Chapman, House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl and House Speaker Pat Grassley to “please facilitate immediate corrective actions where needed.” In addition to not requiring members to report virus cases, legislative leaders have declined to require people inside the building to wear masks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: COVID-19 anxieties kept some potential freshmen from setting foot on college campuses this past fall, but the pandemic also led to an increase in out-of-state students at private schools like McPherson College, which saw a 6.1% surge in that student group. In a year when most colleges have seen a drop in students as 2020 high school graduates skipped or postponed postsecondary education, Kansas’ private colleges bucked that trend and either kept headcounts stable or found ways to attract more students. Between fall 2019 and fall 2020, total undergraduate headcount at 20 private colleges, which are part of the Kansas Independent College Association, actually increased by 2.1%. Meanwhile, fall headcount numbers at state universities fell by 3.5% over that time period. Matt Lindsey, KICA president, said he believes the phenomenon likely has a few reasons. A downward trend in Kansas high school students’ college-going rate was buoyed by a significant increase in out-of-state students, who Lindsey said might have seen the more rural Kansas as an “oasis” amid the pandemic. Of KICA’s 20 colleges, 18 participate in intercollegiate sports, which Lindsey said could have helped attract student-athletes so they could actually compete. And Lindsey said the private colleges offer a smaller, more personal atmosphere.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state has surpassed another COVID-19 vaccination milestone, but the pace needs to pick up among younger adults to defeat the coronavirus, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. More than half of Kentuckians who are 18 and older have received at least a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, the governor said. While about three-fourths of Kentuckians 70 and older have been vaccinated, the rate drops off considerably among people ages 20-49, he said. “So we need to pick it up for our younger Kentuckians if we want to lessen the number of cases and ultimately defeat this virus,” Beshear said at a news conference. Last week, the Democratic governor pledged to lift capacity and physical distancing restrictions for nearly all businesses, venues and events catering to 1,000 or fewer patrons once 2.5 million Kentuckians receive at least their first COVID-19 shot. He also would remove curfews on bars and restaurants. More than 1.6 million Kentuckians have received at least their first COVID-19 shot, surpassing half the state’s adult population , Beshear said Monday. “That is a big milestone,” he said. “It’s one we ought to be excited about. But we also know that we have a lot further to go.” The state still has about 400,000 doses available even before getting its next shipment of at least 150,000, he said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nHouma: A youth soccer club hoping to welcome its new coach from the United Kingdom to the U.S. has been caught up in a morass of bureaucracy deeper than any Louisiana bayou, according to a federal lawsuit recently filed by the team. The case involves a soccer team, the coach it has recruited since 2018 and a presidential order aimed at curbing travel to stop the spread of COVID-19. It names the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in London as defendants. The State Department cited a Jan. 25 proclamation signed by President Joe Biden that bans certain travel from the U.K. due to COVID-19 and said the coach’s visa application could not proceed, the lawsuit says. But a lawyer for the Houma Terrebonne Soccer Association said the coach’s visa is a separate issue from the travel rules and should have been approved months ago. The travel restriction should not interfere with the issuance of a visa for coach Matthew Ferguson, she said. The State Department said Tuesday that it generally does not comment on pending litigation. Ferguson is considered invaluable to the Louisiana team, said New Orleans lawyer Leah Spivey, who represents the coach and the soccer association.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: More New Englanders have dug in the tidal mudflats during the past year, but the clams aren’t cooperating. The coronavirus pandemic has inspired more people in the Northeast to dig for soft-shell clams, which are also called “steamers” and have been used for generations to make chowder and fried clams. The era of social distancing is conducive to the often solitary work, said Chad Coffin, president of the Maine Clammers Association, which represents commercial clammers. But the U.S. haul of clams has dipped in recent years as the industry has contended with clam-eating predators and warming waters, and 2020 and early 2021 have been especially difficult, industry members said. In Maine, the largest clam-producing state, fishermen produced their lowest haul in more than 90 years at a little more than 1.3 million pounds in 2020. The lack of clams has contributed to higher prices to consumers, Coffin said. It has also sparked fears that future generations of clams will be even smaller in number, he said. The prices are rising due to factors such as interest in local food during the pandemic and a limited supply of clams on the market, said Brian Beal, a professor of marine ecology at the University of Maine at Machias whose research focuses on shellfish.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Gov. Larry Hogan announced a plan Monday to help downtown Baltimore by relocating about 3,300 state employees to the city’s central business district. The state will move 700 employees from the Maryland Department of Human Services downtown. Another 1,200 employees from the Maryland Health Department also will be relocating there. They will be the first of the 3,300 state employees who will work downtown. The governor said the state is budgeting $50 million for the relocation. Hogan said the plan is to help revitalize the central business district, where office vacancies are up nearly 34% because of the pandemic, and major businesses have announced plans to relocate to other parts of the city.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Five front-line workers and community members were gifted entries into this fall’s Boston Marathon on Monday, the Patriots’ Day holiday when the race is normally run. The Boston Globe reports Boston Marathon champion Des Linden surprised the five after they jogged across the finish line with her during a ceremonial mile-long run. This year’s marathon will take place in October because of the coronavirus pandemic. “It means the world to me, honestly,” Chris Vasquez, a member of the local Pioneers Run Crew, told the Globe. “I was definitely blindsided.” The others invited were Dorothy Anderson, a member of the Massachusetts National Guard; Jessie Chen, who recently organized a #StopAsianHate relay along the marathon route; Lindsay Devers, a nurse anesthetist at Massachusetts General Hospital; and Rochelle Solomon, a compliance officer at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Linden, who won the marathon in 2018, also announced Monday that she’ll compete in the 125th running. “I’ve fallen in love with this race, and I’m always excited to be here,” she said, according to the paper. “I’m thrilled to be back.” This year’s race will have space for 20,000 entrants – a smaller field than prior years. The marathon, first run in 1897, was canceled for the first time last year because of the pandemic.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer traveled out of state more than a month ago to visit her elderly father, who has a chronic disease, her office said Monday. The disclosure, which confirmed reporting by the Lansing-based publication MIRS, came weeks after the governor warned the public about spring break trips, particularly to Florida, amid a surge in coronavirus cases. Two of her top aides, including Michigan’s health director, vacationed in Southern states despite a state recommendation to avoid travel. Spokesman Bobby Leddy said Whitmer “did not go on spring break” and went to “assist her elderly father, who is battling a chronic illness.” He did not say which state she visited, but the governor said early in the pandemic that her father was a snowbird in Florida with “compromised lung function, and I’m worried about him.” The trip was her third out of state in the past six months, Leddy said. She went to President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January and visited National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., in March. “All trips were very brief, two full days or less, closely followed public health guidelines, and were made when Michigan’s daily positivity rate was in the low single digits,” Leddy said. Whitmer was not vaccinated when she visited her father but is regularly tested for the coronavirus. Her father, 81-year-old Richard Whitmer – a retired president and CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan – was fully vaccinated. The Michigan Republican Party accused the Democratic governor of hypocrisy.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Aiming to wipe out a backyard colony of about 25 cats in the gentlest way possible, Maia Rumpho’s nonviolent approach is to sterilize the cats and remove the kittens, so the colony slowly dies off. She said it’s the humane way to deal with a surprising result of the pandemic: a population explosion of tame-turned-wild cats. The pandemic reduced animal-control efforts, exactly when stressed pet owners began to dump unwanted cats on street corners. The cats bred quickly, moving into backyards and looking for food. That is why spring is somewhat more quiet this year, said cat-protector Christine Gruber – feral cats eat songbirds. She monitors six colonies in the Dayton’s Bluff area of St. Paul but said she can’t keep up with the rising tide of unadoptable cats. “It’s becoming harder,” Gruber said, “for me to even make a dent.” When the pandemic forced a statewide lockdown in March 2020, the animal welfare system was a casualty. Meanwhile, Minnesotans wanted more pets. Demand for adoptions and veterinary services grew. At one point, the Animal Humane Society had 8,000 adoption requests and 1,200 animals waiting to be sterilized. Cats multiplied quickly in low-income communities as COVID-19 forced nonprofits to suspend their mobile spay/neuter vans, which serve those areas.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A multimillion-dollar grant from the Bower Foundation to the University of Mississippi Medical Center is funding graduate-level education of 64 registered nurses around the state. The project, Building a Strong Future for Nursing in Mississippi, is fueled by the $3.8 million, four-year grant and aims to increase the number of nurse educators in the state. It covers full tuition and a stipend to registered nurses with associate degrees who will enter UMMC’s master of science in nursing program through a virtual platform. The 64 scholarships will be split among two master’s degree programs. Like the rest of the nation, Mississippi is in dire need of nurse educators and health care administrators. In 2019, more than 80,000 students in the United States who were eager to enter nursing school were turned down, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. There weren’t enough nurse educators. The number of clinical sites and classrooms had dwindled. Budgets were strained. Dr. Julie Sanford, dean of UMMC’s School of Nursing, said the pandemic only worked to exacerbate these trends as many nurse educators left their work to take high-paying clinical jobs, many leaving Mississippi.\n\nMissouri\n\nRolla: Pro-mask candidates are leaving office and occupancy limits are falling by the wayside in the state as communities tire of pandemic restrictions. In the central Missouri city of Rolla, a slate of anti-mask candidates joined the City Council on Monday after being elected this month even though the mask mandate they opposed was allowed to expire two months ago, St. Louis Public Radio reports. “We recognized that ‘Hey, we’ve got people on the council that don’t necessarily go along with our value system,’ ” said Robert Kessinger, who was among those who defeated five council members who backed the city’s mask requirement and capacity restrictions. Other anti-mask elected officials also gained seats in April elections, including in the tourist community of Branson. Joplin, meanwhile, dropped all its occupancy limits Monday, The Joplin Globe reports. Active COVID-19 cases have dropped dramatically in Joplin since their winter peak, although they recently increased from 19 two weeks ago to 25 as of Monday, said Ryan Talken, the city’s health director. He also noted that nearly half of a local clinic’s 300 vaccine appointments Tuesday were still unfilled as of Monday, mirroring what is happening in communities around the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has signed a bill limiting the power of local public health boards to issue mandates in response to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. Local elected officials such as county commissioners can change or rescind health mandates following Gianforte’s signature Friday. GOP state Rep. David Bedey sponsored the bill in response to what some Republicans have described as unelected health officers overstepping their authority. Before the law, appointed local health boards could enact rules such as mask mandates without consulting elected officials. The law explicitly prohibits health mandates from interfering with religious services. It also limits the allowable penalty for businesses that violate health regulations to $250. The Legislature passed the measure largely along party lines. Most Democrats opposed it, saying it could allow politics to overpower science when making decisions during a health crisis. The law comes after months of anger from some residents and lawmakers over what they have called arbitrary and unfair health orders, including mask mandates, business restrictions and limits on gatherings. Some local health officials in Montana have resigned after encountering a lack of support from elected officials for their efforts to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state’s unemployment rate in March dropped to 2.9%, tying the state for the lowest rate in the country. The Nebraska Department of Labor reported Friday that the rate was down from 3.1% in February and marked a 0.2 percentage point decline from March 2020. “Nebraska’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has reached pre-pandemic levels,” Commissioner of Labor John H. Albin said in a news release. Nebraska’s rate was tied with South Dakota, Utah and Vermont for lowest in the nation. The national rate for March was 6%.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The head of the state coronavirus response effort acknowledged Monday that almost 58,000 people who received COVID-19 vaccine shots in Nevada didn’t provide an in-state address, but he did not see that as a cause for concern. “Everyone deserves access to this lifesaving vaccine,” COVID-19 Task Force chief Caleb Cage said, comparing the number with the nearly 1.7 million doses of vaccine reported as administered by the state Department of Health and Human Services. “The information we are seeing … is not cause for concern.” Vaccinations are now offered to anyone 16 and older in every state. In Nevada, health officials reported upticks in the statewide test positivity rate, to 5.9% from 5.7% on Friday, and added 698 new cases and three deaths to totals posted on the state coronavirus website. Officials said the large number of new cases, bringing the state total during the pandemic to nearly 311,000, was due to the state stopping its reporting of COVID-19 metrics during weekends. The official number of deaths from the pandemic in Nevada is now 5,368. The rise in the percentage of people who are tested who are found to have the coronavirus comes after Gov. Steve Sisolak raised maximum capacity levels to 50% at most businesses about a month ago.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Dartmouth College plans to host vaccination clinics on campus now that the state has lifted its residency requirements for COVID-19 shots. As of Monday, anyone 16 or older is eligible for a vaccine in New Hampshire regardless of where they live. Dartmouth plans to partner with the state to open clinics starting the week of May 3, officials said in a message to faculty, students and staff. The college is planning to increase access to campus facilities and ease travel restrictions on a rolling basis through the summer and into the fall, officials said. Last week, Provost Joseph Helble announced that all students coming to campus in September will be required to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, some K-12 schools have started their first full week of in-person instruction in more than a year, though waivers allowed eight districts to maintain at least partially remote schedules. Gov. Chris Sununu had ordered all public K-12 schools to begin offering in-person education five days per week by Monday. According to the Department of Education, a dozen districts requested waivers because of staffing shortages or other issues.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: As hospitalizations began to steadily increase this spring during another wave of the pandemic, emergency departments filled with a new demographic: working-age adults. “The overall COVID population in our hospitals is getting significantly younger,” said Dr. Daniel Varga, chief physician executive of Hackensack Meridian, the state’s largest hospital network. “It’s very different from what we were seeing this time last year.” The percentage of COVID-19 patients being admitted to hospitals who were under 60 years old jumped to 49% last week – a sizable increase from December, when that group represented about 35% of COVID-19 admissions, according to the state Health Department. Public health officials say the trend shows the efficacy of vaccines, since the vast majority of New Jersey seniors have received at least one dose. On the flip side, it also shows two worrisome trends for health officials: the spread of more contagious coronavirus variants and younger, unvaccinated people engaging in more risky behavior, such as gathering maskless in groups indoors. “The older patients were doing what they needed to do, staying inside and wearing masks,” said Dr. Michael Cascarina, who runs a family practice in Brick. “It’s not followed nearly as strictly as you look at younger patients. Part of it is pandemic fatigue. Part of it is not liking being told what to do.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Las Cruces Public Schools is shortening the amount of time students who attended a “secret prom” have to quarantine, and it’s not likely attendees will face disciplinary action, the district’s superintendent said. LCPS Interim Superintendent Ralph Ramos said the district was notified last week of Mayfield High’s off-campus “secret prom” that happened April 10. A community member reported the gathering to the governor’s office, which then forwarded the report to the Public Education Department and the Department of Health. Once the district was notified Thursday, it announced that Mayfield High would transition to remote learning for 10 days, from Friday through next Monday. District officials say the switch to remote learning is meant to mitigate any potential spread of the coronavirus and comes under advisement from state education and health officials. “There was approximately 200 to 500 students in one place without face masks,” Ramos said Monday. “To me, that’s a huge concern. I’m not here to police private properties. I’m not here to police anything but what happens on campuses. … When I see a mass gathering like that, when we know that our county is not (allowing) us to have more than 10 people at one location, that brings safety concerns to us at LCPS.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s attorney general is investigating whether Gov. Andrew Cuomo broke the law by having members of his staff help write and promote his pandemic leadership book. In a letter dated April 13 and made public Monday, state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli authorized Attorney General Letitia James to investigate the work state employees did on drafting and editing the book, “American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic,” which was released last fall. James’ office confirmed it received the referral letter but declined further comment, citing an “ongoing investigation.” Cuomo and his spokespeople have acknowledged that senior members of his staff helped with the book, but they’ve insisted the work was done on a voluntary basis on their private time. DiNapoli, an independently elected fiscal officer, asked James to investigate the “alleged commission of any indictable offense or offenses in violation of” laws barring public officials from using state resources for private purposes. DiNapoli authorized the attorney general to convene a grand jury, if she chose to do so, and prosecute anyone believed to have violated those laws. A spokesperson for Cuomo, Rich Azzopardi, dismissed the idea of an investigation as a political stunt. “We have officially jumped the shark,” he said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The current longest-serving member of the state House was stripped Tuesday of her chairmanship on the powerful House Finance Committee. Speaker Tim Moore removed 17-term Rep. Julia Howard from the tax-policy committee and placed her on the Appropriations Committee, according to a document from the House Clerk’s Office provided to the Associated Press. Moore’s initials affirming the change are on the paperwork. Neither Howard nor Moore immediately responded Tuesday to phone calls or email messages seeking comment on what happened. But the two have been in an unusually public feud in recent days over tax legislation. Howard has criticized Moore and other fellow House Republicans for advancing a measure that would give additional state tax breaks to businesses that took federal loans to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Many House members from both parties took the Payroll Protection Program loans as well, including Moore. Howard, one of four senior co-chairs of the committee until Tuesday, said last week that she was pressured by House Republicans to hear the bill in the committee. She told The News & Observer of Raleigh that the measure was an ethical conflict because her colleagues’ businesses would benefit if the measure became law.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A man who used an ax to smash windows at the entrance of Republican U.S. Sen. John Hoeven’s office in downtown Fargo over frustrations about a coronavirus bill pleaded guilty Monday in federal court. Thomas Starks, 30, of Lisbon, about 75 miles southwest of Fargo, is charged with destruction of government property for causing the damage discovered by staffers Dec. 21. Later that day the Senate passed a COVID-19 relief package, following months of delays. Tatum O’Brien, Starks’ lawyer, said her client and his family were struggling financially and “relying heavily” on the pandemic aid to be approved. “When the individual economic relief was reduced, he felt frustrated, stressed, and reacted very poorly when he felt his voice was not being heard. He did not intend scare or harm any person, and he deeply regrets his actions,” O’Brien said in a statement. “He pled guilty today because he wants to accept responsibility for his actions and move forward with his family as a law-abiding productive member of society.” Hoeven’s office did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. Investigators said the damage exceeded $1,000. The federal charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Miami and Xavier universities have scheduled extra vaccination clinics just before students pack up to leave for the summer. Many universities across the region had been prepared to provide the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to students, in addition to Moderna and Pfizer. Doug Ruschman, associate vice president for marketing and communications at Xavier, said the J&J pause complicated things for universities because students might be gone by the time they would need their second dose of Moderna or Pfizer. University of Cincinnati spokesperson M.B. Reilly said the school is not hosting any more vaccine clinics for students. There is a second-dose clinic for students, faculty and staff at the Fifth Third Arena on May 5 for those who received their first Pfizer vaccine earlier in April. Miami and its partner TriHealth will offer a Pfizer vaccination clinic April 27 at the Oxford campus, the university confirmed Tuesday. Xavier is offering appointment-only Pfizer vaccinations at Student Health Services from Wednesday through Friday this week. Ruschman said students are also encouraged to find appointments at local Kroger health locations. More than 50% of Xavier students have been vaccinated through the university’s mass vaccination clinics so far, he said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Nearly one-quarter of Oklahomans are now fully vaccinated, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The data shows 24.5% of Oklahoma residents have been fully inoculated against COVID-19, slightly better than the national average of 23%. The CDC data shows 36.9% of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Meanwhile, Oklahoma reported 186 confirmed new cases of COVID-19 on Monday and 21 new deaths. That brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus infections to 445,650 and the state’s death count to 8,145.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: State health and safety officials have fined Lowe’s home improvement stores in Albany and Redmond more than $35,000 for failing to ensure that customers wore masks, face coverings or face shields. Through employer and employee interviews and an examination of records, the inspections determined supervisors at the stores were aware of the requirement to ensure customer use of facial coverings and yet intentionally decided against carrying out their responsibilities, Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration officials said in a news release. “The stores’ purposeful infractions illustrate failures to account for reasonable and established measures to help prevent the potential spread of COVID-19 through customer-to-employee transmission,” they said. Each store was cited $17,500 for disregarding Oregon Health Authority requirements to ensure customers older than age 5 wear face coverings. The Redmond store was cited for two additional serious violations: failing to develop a complete risk assessment to identify potential employee exposure to the coronavirus and failing to develop and implement an infection control plan. It was fined $300 for each of those violations. The stores have 30 days to appeal the citations.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate fell slightly in March, as payrolls expanded and every economic sector except for construction recorded growth, according to state figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate was 7.3%, down a tenth of a percentage point from February’s adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. That was more than a whole point above the national rate of 6% in March. In a survey of households, the labor force remained virtually the same in March, at almost 6.34 million. The number of employed rose 8,000, while the number of unemployed fell by 7,000. The state hit a record high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls in Pennsylvania expanded in February by 24,000. Pennsylvania has regained about 60% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million in February 2020, according to state figures. The education and health services sector and the leisure and hospitality sector led the gainers. The leisure and hospitality sector – which includes restaurants, bars and hotels – remains down about 25% from pre-pandemic levels, or about 140,000 jobs, after shedding an estimated 60% of its jobs last spring.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Medical experts in New England suggest it might soon be safe enough for states to lift mask requirements when outdoors. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, tweeted Sunday that wearing masks indoors should still be required, but outdoor infections are rare and mostly tend to happen when large groups gather in confined spaces for long periods of time, The Boston Globe reports. “I think it’s pretty safe to be out and about walking around without a mask, especially in large parts of the country where infection numbers are under reasonable control,” he said on CNN. Dr. Paul Sax, clinical director of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, also agreed it might be time to lift the mandates, especially in places were people can safely distance. “Transmissions do not take place between solitary individuals going for a walk, transiently passing each other on the street, a hiking trail, or a jogging track,” he said in a blog post on the New England Journal of Medicine website. “That biker who whizzes by without a mask poses no danger to us, at least from a respiratory virus perspective.” Sax similarly stressed that indoor mask regulations should persist, at least until more people are vaccinated.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The COVID-19 economic downturn was not as bad as feared in the state, so lawmakers suddenly have a lot more money to spend. The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday set aside money for a 2% raise for state employees and a $1,000 raise for all teachers as the panel approved its version of the roughly $10 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1. Between one-time money from lawsuit settlements and saved from previous budgets and an extra $386 million mostly in tax revenue thanks to federal stimulus money and economic problems that did not turn out as bad as expected, South Carolina lawmakers have nearly $1.7 billion extra to spend in the 2021-22 fiscal year. And that does not count $2.1 billion of federal stimulus money Congress approved in March that the state has years to spend. Sen. Sean Bennett said lawmakers need to ask state agencies to spend federal money before state tax dollars when they can and remember they may be back in more than one special session after the Legislature adjourns in May to figure out spending plans for all that cash. “We should almost approach this year as an ongoing budget,” said Bennett, R-Summerville.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state again reported no additional COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, but hospitalizations tied to the coronavirus have increased to a number not seen since early February. South Dakota reported 171 new cases from the prior day, while active cases went down by 75 and now stand at 2,078, according to the state. Deaths stand at 1,953 since the start of the pandemic, the state reported. South Dakota has seen 121,360 cases of the coronavirus since last spring, the department of health reported. Hospitalizations tied to COVID-19 rose by 12. The reported 124 COVID-19 patients hospitalized are the most since Feb. 4. There were 42.7% of hospital beds available in the state Tuesday, with 44.1% of adult intensive care beds available, according to the state. Out of those hospitalized with the virus, 24 were in ICUs and 11 on ventilators, both up from Monday’s numbers. According to the health department, 537,671 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in South Dakota. Out of all the people who received a vaccine, 317,780 have completed their respective series of dosages.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city has the capacity to vaccinate 60,000 people per week, but only 23,101 people received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine last week. The week prior, 35,343 people received a shot. But even as demand is shrinking for the vaccine, the reproductive rate of the coronavirus is increasing as the B.117 variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, has become the dominant strain in Shelby County. “In spite of the fact that we only had 65 cases reported yesterday, we know the epidemic is growing. That’s what we’re concerned about,” said David Sweat, deputy director of the Shelby County Health Department. The reproductive rate of the virus is now 1.14, meaning each case is creating 1.14 new cases, growing the outbreak. The B.117 strain is 50% more contagious and 30% more lethal, Sweat said. But the vaccines appear to protect against the strain. Sweat urged people to continue masking, social distancing and hand-washing and to get vaccinated. “Crucially, a year ago, when we were at this podium talking about the epidemic, a tool we did not have was the vaccine,” Sweat said. “We had no way to immunize people against this virus and prevent them from getting infected. Today we have that tool. ... That’s a miracle of science.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State health officials are launching a $1.5 million radio and television ad campaign to promote the next phase of vaccinating residents against COVID-19, the Texas Department of State Health Services announced Monday. The campaign will include commercials aimed at specific groups of Texans shown by research to be least likely to be vaccinated. Later this week, state health officials will hold the first of 22 parking lot pop-up events around Texas. The four-hour events hosted in Walmart parking lots through mid-May will feature a 16-foot video wall displaying facts about COVID-19 vaccines. The first three events will be Thursday in Austin, Friday in Houston and Saturday in Beaumont, according to a statement from health officials. Johns Hopkins University researchers said 35% of the state’s population had received at least one vaccine dose, while 22% had been fully vaccinated. Meanwhile, weekend report delays are being cited for depressed Texas coronavirus numbers. State health officials reported just 1,178 new cases and nine new deaths from COVID-19 on Monday. Those totals are down from 2,430 new cases and 65 new deaths Saturday. Johns Hopkins University data also shows they are significantly lower than seven-day rolling averages of 3,360 new daily cases and 52 new deaths daily.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Health officials on Monday announced more options for free rapid antigen coronavirus testing across the state. The test sites, which are determined by state health officials based on an area’s positivity rates, testing rates, wastewater sampling and other surveillance data, offer free tests to anyone age 3 or older, with test results typically expected in less than an hour. Some of the locations are drive-thru, while others are offered indoors. Those held indoors ask people to wear masks and maintain social distancing while waiting in line. Anyone with symptoms associated with COVID-19, even if they are minor, is encouraged to get tested. Those who have been in contact with someone who has had COVID-19 while they could have been infectious are also encouraged to get tested. The Utah Department of Health asks that anyone seeking a test register online first. Registration can be done on-site, but it could take longer to receive a test. Identification may also be required. Rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than the also-common polymerase chain reaction tests, according to UDOH. This means PCR tests are better than antigen tests at detecting the virus, especially when a person has small amounts of virus in their body. Health officials may recommend a follow-up, confirmation PCR test.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is seeing a steady drop in COVID-19 cases and a strong rate of people getting vaccinated, state officials said Tuesday, making them optimistic about the future and a more normal summer than last year’s. The seven-day average number of coronavirus cases has dropped 39% since April 1 and 24% in the past week, according to Michael Pieciak, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation, who has been monitoring COVID-19 statistics during the pandemic. Vermont also has among the highest rates in the country of people 65 and older getting vaccinated, at 93%, and is in the top 10 of states in the amount of shots given and the percentage of the population that is fully vaccinated, he said. “We have made remarkable progress here in Vermont,” said Deputy Human Services Secretary Jenney Samuelson. “Vermonters are known to stick together through difficult times, and this is just another example of our extraordinary resilience and dedication to doing the right thing.” Cases are falling fast among the younger populations in Vermont that were thought to be driving the spread of the coronavirus at the end of March, Pieciak said. They just became eligible for COVID-19 shots, so vaccinations are not the reason for the decline, Pieciak said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Jobless workers collecting unemployment benefits will be required to report looking for work beginning in early June, the Virginia Employment Commission announced Tuesday. The work search requirement, part of state and federal law, was suspended during the pandemic. The commission announced earlier this month that it would be reinstated and on Tuesday gave the effective date: the week ending June 5. “Claimants must search and report two job searches per week,” commission spokeswoman Joyce Fogg wrote in an email. The requirement will also apply to people who get Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. Virginia Employment Commissioner Ellen Marie Hess said earlier this month that the requirement is coming back as demand for workers rises and as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Sunday, rising 19.1% as 9,319 cases were reported. The previous week had 7,827 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Washington ranked 26th among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Within the state, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Ferry, Cowlitz and Whitman counties. Adding the most new cases overall were King County, with 2,676 cases; Pierce County, with 1,400 cases; and Snohomish County, with 959. Weekly case counts rose in 29 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week’s pace were in King, Snohomish and Clark counties. Washington ranked 22nd among states in share of people receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 40.3% of its residents at least partially inoculated. The national rate is 39.5%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Washington reported administering another 529,802 shots, compared with 507,122 the week before that. In all, Washington reported it has administered 4,965,443 doses.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Monday lifted a limit on the number of people who can gather for social events and tweaked the state’s face-covering mandate to allow people exercising indoors to go maskless. The governor had already lifted most other restrictions on businesses and public life, leaving in place an indoor mask mandate. Residents engaging in physical activity at a fitness center or other indoor space can take off their masks but are expected to wear them at all other times, such as when resting at a gym, the governor’s new executive order said. About 38% of residents have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, while 28.4% are fully vaccinated, state data shows. Justice highlighted that more than 46% of residents ages 16 and over – those currently eligible for a shot – have received at least one dose. He has a goal of covering 85% of senior citizens. About 75% are partially vaccinated so far, he said. He also made a plea for younger people to get shots. “I am urging the young people especially right now, and older people, to help me make sure that we get our 16- to 35-year-olds vaccinated,” he said at his regularly scheduled news conference. Officials have recently urged residents to step forward to receive vaccines after the pace of administration slowed down due to declining demand.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Schools across the state will receive more than $175 million in federal funding to pay for school-based coronavirus testing for teachers, students and staff, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. The money is coming to Wisconsin as part of $10 billion that the U.S. Department of Health Services announced in March it was targeting to help schools reopen across the country. The tests would be voluntary. Evers said the state Department of Health Services will be working with the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction to develop a testing program in conjunction with what schools may already have in place. Schools were sent a survey last week to ask what type of programs would best meet their needs, Evers said. Different testing options will be available to schools, and more information will be released as they are developed, Evers said. Concerns about new coronavirus variants more easily infecting people under age 16, who are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccines, have increased as case counts have gone up. In Wisconsin, just over 16% of all confirmed cases have been among people 19 or younger. As of Tuesday, more than 40% of people 16 and up in Wisconsin have received at least one vaccine dose, including 19% of people ages 16 or 17.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Celebrating their vaccination status, a local ranching family has burned COVID-19 in effigy, setting aflame a more than 20-foot-high structure shaped like a man with a “COVID” shirt and a coronavirus-spiked head, the Gillette News Record reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/21"}]}

The system continuously monitors maternal vital signs, fetal heart rate, contractions, and labor progression to help clinicians quickly identify any concerning developments for faster intervention.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center delivers more than 750 babies each year. Stacy Wood, RN, director of women’s services, indicates this new technology is an important resource to support maternal/fetal health and safe deliveries.\n\n“Every delivery is unique and the health and well-being of every mom and baby is our priority during childbirth,” says Jeanette Toney, MD. “While most births happen without complication, there are some inherent risks in the delivery of a newborn. This new technology adds another layer of protection throughout the labor process to help our maternity team recognize, prevent and respond to avoidable complications.”\n\nThrough pattern recognition, the technology can also pinpoint opportunities for overall improvement based on consolidated data from multiple births. As the maternity team reviews trends and identifies areas where improvement is possible, the hospital can use that information to develop protocols that further increase safety and may lead to better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\n“By investing in this technology, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center is making labor and delivery safer for mothers and babies,” said Colin McRae, chief executive officer, Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center. “Our physicians and nurses are highly skilled medical professionals and excellent caregivers and they appreciate the use of technology to support their work, especially when it helps keep our patients safe.”\n\nThe team at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center has received the Daisy Team award for exceptional prenatal, delivery and postpartum care. Additionally, the spacious birthing suites at Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center feature a labor, delivery, recovery and postpartum (LDRP) model that keeps mother and child together from admission to discharge. The larger rooms also accommodate larger family support networks.\n\nTo learn more about Tennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center childbirth services or to find a physician, visit tennovanorthknoxville.com/maternity-care-services or call 865-859-8000.\n\nTennova Healthcare-North Knoxville Medical Center offers a free e-newsletter with a monthly dose of health and wellness inspiration sent directly to your inbox from a trusted medical source.

(June 20, 2022) – A team of University of Tennessee Health Science Center researchers has been awarded $2.19 million from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for their investigation of the neurotoxic effects of toluene, a common chemical found in many household products.\n\nAlex M. Dopico, MD, Van Vleet Chair of Excellence and professor in the Department of Pharmacology, Addiction Science, and Toxicology (PHAST) in the UTHSC College of Medicine, and Anna N. Bukiya, PhD, professor in the same department, are principal investigators on the award. Jeff Steketee, PhD, also professor in the PHAST Department and chair of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, is a co-investigator.\n\nToluene reaches the brain through inhalation. Intoxication with toluene, whether accidental or following recreational use (e.g., “glue sniffing”), leads to dizziness, blurred vision and even neurological deficits with catastrophic outcomes, including death. A reduction in blood flow to the brain is thought to contribute to these toxic effects, but how and why toluene exposure affects the brain circulation is not known.\n\nThe team hypothesizes that toluene reduces the activity of a protein (the BK channel) located in the cerebral artery muscle cells, causing the brain arteries to constrict upon exposure. Performing tests at the molecular level using computational methods, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of BK channel function in animal models, the team aims to identify the specific mechanism and site of action in BK channels that makes cerebral arteries constrict in the presence of toluene. Their tests will include delivering new selective drug therapies for early intervention in toluene-induced brain ischemia.\n\nThe project, titled “Ionic mechanisms of toluene cerebrovascular actions,” is being funded over five years.\n\nAs Tennessee’s only public, statewide, academic health system, the mission of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center is to bring the benefits of the health sciences to the achievement and maintenance of human health through education, research, clinical care, and public service, with a focus on the citizens of Tennessee and the region. The main campus in Memphis includes six colleges: Dentistry, Graduate Health Sciences, Health Professions, Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. UTHSC also educates and trains medicine, pharmacy, and/or health professions students, as well as medical residents and fellows, at major sites in Knoxville, Chattanooga and Nashville.

This show and Women Artists: Highlights from the Hunter Museum of American Art (one floor up) document what two important Tennessee cultural organizations are doing to support and empower women artists.\n\nLike the Hunter, the KMA has actively sought to acquire outstanding works by women, who have long lagged behind their male counterparts when it comes to museum-level recognition. The selection on view reflects the broad technical and aesthetic range found in contemporary art by women. A mixed media painting on wooden sections by Alison Moritsugu conveys a monumental landscape, expansive yet incomplete. Nancy Rubins elevates graphite drawing into a large sculptural construction apparently shaped by violent forces. British artist Marilène Oliver constructs provocative portraits of her family in the form of acrylic sheets imprinted with digital medical scans. Patty Chang uses water and mirrors to transform her own image taken in a Belgian church into a complex photographic work fragmented by harsh angles and provocative reflections. In her video Joan of Arc, Alex McQuilkin responds to Maria Falconetti’s memorable lead role in the legendary 1928 French silent film by Carl Dreyer, and to the film’s themes of adolescent desire, faith, and suffering. These and other selected works call overdue attention to women’s significant role in reshaping the contemporary art landscape.\n\nThe artists featured in this exhibition are Patty Chang, Janet Fish, Marcia Goldenstein, Michelle Grabner, EJ Hauser, Julie Heffernan, Jean Hess, Kate Katomski, Karen LaMonte, Pam Longobardi, Lauren Luloff, Alex McQuilkin, Alison Mortisugu, Althea Murphy-Price, Marilène Oliver, Amy Pleasant, Sumi Putman, Nancy Rubins, Tommie Rush, Denise Stewart-Sanabria, Jemima Stehli, and Toots Zynsky.\n\nOle Red Gatlinburg to celebrate Fourth of July with midnight parade patio party\n\nGatlinburg, Tenn. – Ole Red Gatlinburg will offer one of the best ways to celebrate Fourth of July this year when they host their Midnight Parade Patio Party during the annual Gatlinburg parade.

We encourage families in that situation to visit the food ministry because the team there does an exemplary job of assisting those in the community who need it. We partner with them because their mission of taking care of families is part of who we are as well.”\n\nTo take advantage of Sevier County Days, Sevier County residents must present a state- or federally-issued photo identification with a valid Sevier County zip code at any designated Dollywood (June 13-19) or Dollywood’s Splash Country (now- June 12) ticket booth.

Since that time, total contributions to the food ministry are more than $1.4 million.

Ever notice those historical markers along Volunteer Landing? They tell a non-chronological story of soldiers, authors, and sailors who had something to do with Knoxville's waterfront since 1791, connecting Cherokee chiefs to the Civil War to the Tennessee Vols. Jack Neely, historian of the Knoxville History Project, did the research for those markers back in the 1990s, and will help tell the stories, including that of Vagabondia, the long-vanished riverfront home of author Frances Hodgson Burnett that inspired the title of one of her early novels. It was surprisingly near the ramshackle houseboat home of Cornelius Suttree, the stoic protagonist of a very different novel by Cormac McCarthy. This year, Jack will also talk about the role the riverfront played in the 1982 World's Fair.

As one of the most sought-after youth sports complexes in the country, Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge will be able to host teams from around the country on 10 total fields, including access to the newly renovated fields at Pigeon Forge’s Wear Farm City Park.\n\nThe park’s four fields will be completely upgraded and reimagined prior to the start of the 2023 season. Similar to the original six fields at Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge which opened in 2016, each field at Wear Farm City Park will become a youth replica of famous Major League Baseball parks of the past and present.\n\nResidents of Pigeon Forge will benefit from the renovations as Wear Farm City Park will continue to host tournaments throughout the year on state-of-the-art artificial turf that closely replicates real grass.\n\n“Every year, our teams and their families take home countless fond memories of the Pigeon Forge area when they participate in The Ripken Experience™,” said Cal Ripken, Jr., who co-founded Ripken Baseball with his brother Bill Ripken. “The views are unbelievable and the feeling you have when you experience our complex is special. The demand to play here is through the roof. This is an exciting opportunity to expand and welcome even more baseball families to Pigeon Forge.”\n\nWear Farm City Park’s four fields will be transformed into youth replicas of the following big league stadiums: St. Louis’ Busch Stadium, Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati’s Riverfront Stadium. The $3 million renovation project will begin this summer.\n\n“Pigeon Forge’s partnership with Ripken Baseball is a successful one, as demonstrated by the annual increase in demand for the ball fields and the direct impact on our city’s tourism industry due to the many families who visit,” said Pigeon Forge City Manager Earlene Teaster. “The upgrades to Wear Farm City Park are a win-win for The Ripken Experience™ and our Pigeon Forge residents as these fields bring vast improvements for everyone to enjoy.”\n\nPigeon Forge residents and local youth teams will enjoy the renovations immediately following completion. The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge’s access to Wear Farm City Park applies primarily to daytime hours during the summer season, allowing the four baseball fields to remain available for Pigeon Forge residents during evenings, weekends, and most Fridays. The addition of artificial turf provides longer days during the winter months (November through early March), earlier year-round start times, and quicker turnaround during the event of rain. Wear Farm City Park is open daily from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. The park, which also has soccer and youth football facilities, will continue to host youth baseball leagues.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts more than 1,000 teams annually from over 30 states, traveling from as far away as California, Alaska, and overseas. Players’ families, many of whom are first-time visitors to Pigeon Forge, have a significant impact on the Pigeon Forge economy. A 2018 economic impact study attributed $33.8 million in visitor spending to The Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge during the facility’s nine-month season that year.\n\nThe appeal of Pigeon Forge as a family vacation destination was a major reason the city built the $22.5 million complex and contracted with Ripken Baseball to operate it. During seven seasons of operations, the facility has solidified Pigeon Forge as a major sports tourism destination. In addition, research indicates that 99 percent of those who visit the facility reside outside of Sevier County.\n\nTournament participants, coaches, and their families contribute to the local economy through overnight lodging stays ticket purchases to area attractions, restaurant dining, and other purchases.\n\nPigeon Forge is located in Sevier County just six miles from the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park.\n\nSince opening its doors in March 2016, more than 5,000 youth baseball teams and 250 high school softball teams have taken to the six fields at The Ripken Experience Pigeon Forge. In total, more than 75,000 players and coaches have traveled to play ball on fields that offer unobstructed views of the Great Smoky Mountains, with an additional 1,000 teams expected to travel to the complex for competition in 2022.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge is located on a ridge above Pigeon Forge. Each field borrows its design inspiration from current and former ballparks highlighting the professional player progression from the Minor to Major Leagues, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore.\n\nThe others are Calfee Park in Pulaski, Va., the oldest park in the Appalachian League; Fluor Field in Greenville, S.C., known as “Little Fenway”; Engel Stadium in Chattanooga, Tenn., a filming location for the “42” movie about Jackie Robinson; BB&T Ballpark in Winston-Salem, N.C.; and Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, N.M.\n\nThe Ripken Experience™ Pigeon Forge hosts tournaments nine months out of the year and offers year-round branded events in its 14,000-square-foot clubhouse. Tournaments are free to spectators, and parking is free at the complex.\n\nVisitor information about Pigeon Forge is available online at MyPigeonForge.com and toll-free at 800-251-9100.

The House wants the documents in pursuit of legislation, the prosecutors for a grand jury investigation.\n\nOn the other hand, all the conservatives and some liberal justices wondered whether the subpoenas go too far in seeking a decade of private data involving not only the president but members of his family. They suggested such extensive probing could harass and distract both Trump and future presidents.\n\nAfter nearly 3½ hours of debate, it seemed likely that the two titanic battles will not yield the unanimous verdicts against presidential immunity that befell two of Trump's predecessors, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, at the hands of the high court.\n\nThe dilemma was summed up best by the newest associate justice, Brett Kavanaugh, near the end of the debate over the House subpoenas.\n\n“How can we both protect the House’s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency?\" Kavanaugh asked House general counsel Douglas Letter.\n\nICYMI:Supreme Court hears argument in cases over congressional subpoenas\n\nThe dramatic oral arguments, conducted by telephone amid the coronavirus pandemic and broadcast live, could result in landmark rulings on a president's immunity from investigation while in office and Congress' oversight powers, right in the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nIn previous separation-of-powers battles over documents or testimony, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Nixon in 1974 and Clinton in 1997, with their nominees in agreement. The decisions led eventually to Nixon's resignation and Clinton's impeachment.\n\nThat history raises the pressure on today's high court, which Chief Justice John Roberts has said should seek unanimity wherever possible. On Tuesday, it seemed like a tall order.\n\n\"Why should we not defer to the House’s views about its own legislative purposes?\" Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump nominee, asked the president's lawyer.\n\nBut even liberal Associate Justice Stephen Breyer noted the subpoenas \"go way, way beyond tax returns,\" a concern voiced by several conservative colleagues.\n\n\"At some point, there’s a straw that breaks the camel’s back,\" Associate Justice Clarence Thomas said. \"At some point, it debilitates the president.\"\n\nCriminal investigation wins support\n\nThe legal battles pit Trump against three House committees, controlled by Democrats, that have issued subpoenas for eight years of financial documents. A separate fight involves Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance's subpoena for similar documents as well as the tax returns that Trump, unlike recent predecessors, has not released.\n\nIn the New York case, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued that the president has absolute immunity from a criminal investigation while in office, a position that got pushback from several justices.\n\nSekulow said allowing the Manhattan district attorney to obtain Trump’s financial records would empower some 2,300 local district attorneys in the country, most of whom were elected, to target sitting presidents for political purposes.\n\nAssociate Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed highly skeptical, contending that the president was “asking for a broader immunity than anyone else gets.”\n\n\"I find it odd that you want us to rule that there is essentially an absolute immunity from investigative powers, the height of a state’s subpoena – police powers,” she said.\n\nRoberts questioned Sekulow about why the subpoena can’t move forward, saying the court had previously allowed Clinton to be sued by a former employee.\n\n“You focus on the distraction to the president,” Roberts told Sekulow, but in Clinton’s case, the court “was not persuaded that the distraction in that case meant that discovery could not proceed.”\n\nCarey Dunne, general counsel for the Manhattan DA's office, rejected Sekulow’s claim that allowing the subpoena would empower an army of local prosecutors. He noted that the subject of the probe – the Trump Organization – is based in New York City.\n\nAssociate Justice Samuel Alito warned that local prosecutors routinely leak information to the press, but Dunne said he’s not aware of “any kind of real pattern or practice” of leaking grand jury materials.\n\nSolicitor General Noel Francisco, arguing for the Justice Department, did not push for absolute immunity. Instead, he said state prosecutors, like federal prosecutors, should be required to show why the documents they’re seeking are “critical to the charging decision.\"\n\nICYMI:High court considers Manhattan DA's efforts to get Trump's financial records\n\nHouse subpoenas draw skepticism\n\nLawmakers in the congressional cases claim the records will help determine the need for future legislation in areas such as campaign finance law, bank loan practices, and efforts to prevent foreign influence in elections. That view won support from Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\n\"One must investigate before legislation,\" Ginsburg said. \"The purpose of investigation is to frame the legislation.\"\n\nTrump's lawyer in those cases, Patrick Strawbridge, accused lawmakers of setting a \"dragnet\" to see if the president is guilty of tax fraud or money laundering. Without limits, he said, nothing would prevent lawmakers from seeking even Trump's medical records or DNA.\n\n\"These subpoenas are overreaching. They are an obvious distraction,\" Strawbridge said. \"They are going to multiply if this court accepts the path that the House is attempting to lay.\"\n\nThree liberal justices – Ginsburg and Associate Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan – appeared to take the House's side, while Thomas and Alito leaned toward the president. That left Roberts, Gorsuch, Breyer and Kavanaugh closer to the middle.\n\nRoberts summed up the dispute over the breadth of the House subpoenas by noting Congress has a right to seek personal records. But at some point, he said, it can lead to harassment and become a distraction for the president.\n\n\"Most presidents throughout their term have a pretty long to-do list,\" he said.\n\nRisks for the court, Congress, Trump\n\nAll three branches of government have much at stake:\n\n• The political earthquake that some justices may be seeking to sidestep would be most acutely felt if the president loses and the documents are made public during his reelection campaign. For nearly five years since declaring his candidacy in 2015, Trump has managed to keep his tax returns and much of his financial data from prying eyes.\n\n• Congress has much at stake as well. Its oversight authority could be constrained by a ruling in Trump's favor, setting a precedent for future investigations – particularly those viewed as partisan.\n\n• There also are high stakes facing the high court. If it sides with Trump along ideological lines – with five justices named by Republican presidents in the majority and four named by Democrats in dissent – it could emerge as damaged goods in the eyes of the public.\n\nRisky:Supreme Court battle over Donald Trump's finances carries risks for all three branches\n\nThe congressional subpoenas emanate from three House committees, rather than one or both houses of Congress – a potential shortcoming Trump's lawyers have sought to impress upon the Supreme Court.\n\nThe House Committee on Oversight and Reform issued a subpoena to Mazars USA, Trump's accounting firm, more than a year ago seeking financial records from the president, his family business, a trust and the company that runs Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Thus far, two federal courts have upheld the subpoena.\n\nTrump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified before Congress that as a private citizen, Trump routinely overstated or understated his holdings for financial gain. The panel wants to compare eight years of financial documents to Cohen's testimony and government disclosures.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee and the House Intelligence Committee issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Capital One more than a year ago seeking records from Trump, his three oldest children and the Trump Organization. The panels are probing risky lending practices by major financial institutions and efforts by Russia to influence U.S. elections. They, too, have been upheld twice in lower courts.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney's subpoenas came later as part of a criminal probe of hush-money payments that Cohen said were made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed they had affairs with Trump that he has denied. Once again, two lower courts upheld the subpoenas.\n\nTrump's lawyers have argued that the president has absolute immunity while in office from grand jury investigations of criminal conduct. During oral arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, they contended Trump could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and escape prosecution until he leaves office.\n\nRichard Wolf covers the Supreme Court and legal issues for USA TODAY.

The text is among records obtained by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.\n\n“It’s very simple,” Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, adding later in the same missive: “We have multiple paths We control them all.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See ex-Trump official's reaction to Trump Jr.'s 'revealing' texts 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump Jr.’s lawyer Alan S. Futerfas said, “After the election, Don received numerous messages from supporters and others. Given the date, this message likely originated from someone else and was forwarded.”\n\nImmediately before his text to Meadows describing multiple paths for challenging the election, Trump Jr. texted Meadows the following: “This is what we need to do please read it and please get it to everyone that needs to see it because I’m not sure we’re doing it.”\n\nThe November 5 text message outlines a strategy that is nearly identical to what allies of the former President attempted to carry out in the months that followed. Trump Jr. makes specific reference to filing lawsuits and advocating recounts to prevent certain swing states from certifying their results, as well as having a handful of Republican state houses put forward slates of fake “Trump electors.”\n\nIf all that failed, according to the Trump Jr. text, GOP lawmakers in Congress could simply vote to reinstall Trump as President on January 6.\n\n“We have operational control Total leverage,” the message reads. “Moral High Ground POTUS must start 2nd term now.”\n\nThe text from Trump Jr. is revealing on a number of levels. It shows how those closest to the former President were already exchanging ideas for how to overturn the election months before the January 6 insurrection – and before all the votes were even counted. It would be another two days before major news outlets declared Joe Biden the winner on November 7.\n\nThe text also adds to a growing body of evidence of how Trump’s inner circle was actively engaged in discussing how to challenge the election results.\n\nOn March 28, Judge David Carter, a federal judge in California, said that Trump, along with conservative lawyer John Eastman, launched an “unprecedented” campaign to overturn a democratic election, calling it “a coup in search of a legal theory.”\n\nGeorge Terwilliger, an attorney for Meadows, declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the House select committee declined to comment.\n\nForeshadowing the Trump campaign strategy\n\nIn the weeks following the 2020 election, Trump and his allies eventually filed more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits in key states, failing to convince the courts that his claims about a stolen election were justified, or uncover any evidence of widespread voter fraud.\n\nThey also called for various recounts based on those same unfounded voter fraud claims. A number of states conducted recounts in the months after the election, though none of them revealed any fraud substantial enough to have changed the outcome of the vote in any state.\n\nWhile Trump Jr. was publicly pushing various voter fraud conspiracy theories and generally casting doubt about the results in states like Pennsylvania and Georgia, his text to Meadows reveals there were other ideas being discussed privately.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump-endorsed candidate asked about January 6. Watch what happened next 01:48 - Source: CNN\n\nSpecifically, Trump Jr. previews a strategy to supplant authentic electors with fake Republican electors in a handful of states. That plan was eventually orchestrated and carried out by allies of the former President, and overseen by his then-attorney Rudy Giuliani.\n\nIn his text to Meadows, Trump Jr. identifies two key dates in December that serve as deadlines for states to certify their electoral results and compel Congress to accept them. Though the dates are largely ceremonial, in his text Trump Jr. appears to point to them as potential weaknesses to be exploited by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nSeeking Trump electors\n\nTrump Jr.’s November 5 text to Meadows came as similar notions of faithless electors were starting to percolate publicly on conservative social media. Trump Jr. sent the text to Meadows at 12:51 p.m., just minutes after conservative radio host Mark Levin had tweeted a similar idea and suggested state legislatures have final say on electors.\n\nIf secretaries of state were unable to certify the results, Trump Jr. argues in his text to Meadows that they should press their advantage by having Republican-controlled state assemblies “step in” and put forward separate slates of “Trump electors,” he writes.\n\n“Republicans control Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina etc we get Trump electors,” Trump Jr. adds.\n\nTrump Jr.’s text, however, refers to an untested legal theory that state houses are the ultimate authority in elections and can intervene to put forward a different slate of electors than those chosen by the voters, when in reality this is a ceremonial process and the outcome is essentially a foregone conclusion.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump dangles pardons for Jan. 6 rioters while teasing 2024 run 00:58 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Justice Department and the House committee are both investigating the fake electors plot within the context of what unfolded on January 6 and Trump’s broader effort to overturn the election.\n\nThe strategy floated by Trump Jr. is similar to what was outlined by former Texas Governor and Trump Energy Secretary Rick Perry, who texted Meadows on November 4 suggesting three state legislatures ignore the will of their voters and deliver their states’ electors to Trump.\n\n“HERE’s an AGRESSIVE (sic) STRATEGY: Why can t (sic) the states of GA NC PENN and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS (where conflicts and election not called that night) and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS,” Perry’s text message read.\n\nA spokesman for Perry told CNN at the time that the former Energy secretary denies being the author of the text. However, multiple people who know Rick Perry previously confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is Perry’s number.\n\n‘We control them all’\n\nTrump Jr. also texts Meadows that Congress could intervene on January 6 and overturn the will of voters if, for some reason, they were unable to secure enough electoral votes to tip the outcome in Trump’s favor using the state-based strategy.\n\nThat option, according to Trump Jr.’s text, involves a scenario where neither Biden nor Trump have enough electoral votes to be declared a winner, prompting the House of Representatives to vote by state party delegation, with each state getting one vote.\n\n“Republicans control 28 states Democrats 22 states,” Trump Jr. texts. “Once again Trump wins.”\n\n“We either have a vote WE control and WE win OR it gets kicked to Congress 6 January 2021,” he texts Meadows.\n\nIn a series of memos in early January, conservative lawyer John Eastman proposed a variation of that idea.\n\nEastman’s memo laid out a six-step plan for Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election for Trump, which included throwing out the results in seven states because they allegedly had competing electors. In fact, no state had actually put forward an alternate slate of electors – there were merely Trump allies claiming without any authority to be electors.\n\nEastman, who has been subpoenaed by the House select committee and is fighting to keep some of his records secret from investigators, was accused by Carter of likely engaging in a criminal conspiracy with Trump to overturn the election.\n\n“Dr. Eastman has an unblemished record as an attorney and respectfully disagrees with the judge’s findings,” his attorney Charles Burnham said in response to the judge’s ruling.\n\nTrump Jr. pushes Meadows to fire Wray and install loyalist at FBI\n\nTrump Jr. ends his November 5 text by calling for a litany of personnel moves to solidify his father’s control over the government by putting loyalists in key jobs and initiate investigations into the Biden family.\n\n“Fire Wray; Fire Fauci,” he texts, referring to FBI Director Christopher Wray and White House coronavirus adviser Anthony Fauci. Trump Jr. then proposes making former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell interim head of the FBI and having then-Attorney General Bill Barr “select Special prosecutor on HardDrivefromHell Biden crime family.”\n\nAs Trump refused to concede in the days and weeks after the 2020 election, rumors swirled that he was still considering firing Wray, along with several other top officials with whom he had grown frustrated.\n\nTrump and his allies sharply criticized Wray for failing to produce information that they claimed would be harmful to the President’s political enemies, including Biden. CNN previously reported that the prospect of Trump firing Wray hung over the FBI for weeks, dating to before Election Day.\n\nWhile Wray remains in his post and Barr resigned in mid-December 2020 without naming a special prosecutor to investigate the Bidens, Trump Jr.’s text underscores just how precarious the situation at DOJ was in the immediate aftermath of the election.\n\nThe same is true for Trump Jr.’s recommendation that Meadows replace Wray with Grenell, someone who not only lacked the usual qualifications to lead the FBI but also had a proven track record of doing the former President’s bidding.\n\nAfter serving a controversial three-month stint as Trump’s acting intel chief, Grenell hit the campaign trail in late 2020 to help promote Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and support his legal challenges in a key swing state: Nevada.\n\nOn November 5, Biden held a slim lead over Trump in Nevada but appeared poised to win the state’s six electoral votes. That same day, Grenell and Trump campaign officials announced they were filing a new lawsuit to “stop the counting of illegal votes” but provided no evidence to support their claims of rampant fraud.\n\nThis story has been updated with new details of a text message Trump Jr. sent to Meadows.", "authors": ["Ryan Nobles Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer", "Ryan Nobles", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer"], "publish_date": "2022/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/12/the-excerpt-prosecutors-ask-supreme-court-donald-trump-immunity/71890272007/", "title": "The Excerpt: Prosecutors ask Supreme Court if Trump may claim ...", "text": "On today's episode of The Excerpt podcast: In an 'extraordinary' move, prosecutors have asked the Supreme Court to decide if former President Donald Trump may claim immunity in his election interference case.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning, I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Tuesday, December 12th, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, how the Supreme Court is being asked to weigh in on Trump's election interference case. Plus, a pregnant Texas woman has left the state for an abortion, and an investigation reveals a lack of supervision in the military classified documents leak.\n\n♦\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith yesterday asked the Supreme Court to step into the legal battle over whether former President Donald Trump can claim immunity from criminal charges tied to his alleged interference in the 2020 election. I caught up with USA Today Supreme Court correspondent, John Fritze to put the request in context. John, thanks for making the time.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nHey, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo John, what is Special Counsel Jack Smith requesting from the Supreme Court here?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nWhat he's really asking them to do is hurry it up. So you've got a lower court that ruled against former President Trump on whether he could claim immunity from these criminal charges stemming from his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election. And Trump appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeals here in Washington DC. That's a process that could take some time, maybe months before it would work its way up to the Supreme Court on a next appeal and so on. And the problem with that from Jack Smith's perspective is that the trial in this case is supposed to begin in early March. If this thing goes through the normal process, there's no way that that trial will start by March 4th.\n\nAnd so the sort of extraordinary step that Jack Smith is taking here is saying, \"Hey, look, let's cut out the DC Circuit before the Appeals court even gets a chance to look at this. We just need to get this resolved in the Supreme Court. Ultimately it's the Supreme Court that's going to have to decide this issue anyway.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. John, you used the word extraordinary. The government told the Supreme Court that it recognizes this request is extraordinary. Just how unique is this, John?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nYeah, it doesn't happen very often. It has certainly happened. There was an abortion case that came up a year or two ago. It does happen that there are times when one side or the other asks to basically bypass an Appeals Court decision, but it's pretty rare. In my time in doing this, I've been on the speed for three years, I think I've seen it maybe once or maybe twice in the course of that time. So it's pretty unusual.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou mentioned speed is of course, of a lot of importance here. Just how quickly could the Supreme Court make a decision on this?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nSo the court can move as quickly as it wants to. It tends to not move very quickly. So typically, when a case gets appealed to the Supreme Court, it takes months and months. The appeal is filed. It might take three, four, five months for the briefing to come in for the court to make a decision about whether to take it. If they say they will take it, that launches a whole new set of briefs that take months and months. Once those briefs are in, they schedule an argument. And then it usually takes them about two months on average to get an opinion down.\n\nSo really, there are cases that they grant in the end of a term that they don't decide until the next term or longer in some cases. And so it really can take some time. Jack Smith is citing interestingly, a 1974 case involving Richard Nixon and this dealt with kind of a similar issue when the Watergate prosecutors wanted to get their hands on these recordings that Nixon made in the Oval Office. And in that situation, the Supreme Court moved very quickly. According to Smith, within 16 days of the original request, and that was a different court and perhaps a less polarized court. I don't expect to see this court move quite that quickly, but it could move quickly if it wanted to. Within a series of weeks, it could get this thing on the arguments calendar. I think the question is what's the fairest way to do it? The court's going to want to be seen as being extremely fair here given the potential implications of a ruling for or against Trump. And I suspect they're going to be cautious to move at quite the pace that Jack Smith is suggesting.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. John Fritze covers the Supreme Court for USA Today. Thank you, John.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nLater yesterday, Justices indicated they would decide quickly whether to hear the case and ordered Trump's lawyers to respond by December 20th. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court's been busy. The court sided with an 83-year-old woman, letting a federal Appeals Court ruling stand that said Elise Brown could sue the police for excessive force, and in doing so could waive a legal doctrine known as qualified immunity that protects police from liability for civil rights violations in many circumstances. Officers pulled her over and thought the car she was driving was stolen, before drawing their guns and forcing Brown to her knees. And in another case, the court declined to take up a challenge to a ban on so-called conversion therapy for minors. The scientifically discredited practice is used to try and convert LGBTQ+ people to heterosexuality or to change a person's gender identity. By declining to hear the appeal, the court effectively left the ban in place.\n\n♦\n\nA pregnant Texas woman seeking an abortion has left the state after the Texas Supreme Court blocked her from having one, according to attorneys yesterday. Kate Cox, a mother of two from Dallas, is in her 21st week of pregnancy, and doctors have diagnosed her fetus with Trisomy 18, a fatal disorder. They recommended an abortion to preserve her reproductive health, with the procedure largely prohibited under Texas law. In 2021, Texas passed one of the most restrictive state abortion laws prohibiting the procedure once cardiac activity can be detected, typically around six weeks before most know they're pregnant. When the US Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade in 2022, the state's trigger law went into effect, prohibiting abortion from the moment of fertilization with a few exceptions. Nancy Northup is the Chief Executive from the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox in a lawsuit challenging the Texas abortion bans. She said that Cox has, \"Been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer.\"\n\n♦\n\nThe Air Force has disciplined more than a dozen people after an investigation revealed a lack of adequate supervision and a culture of complacency following massive online leaks of classified information. I spoke with USA Today Justice Department Correspondent, Bart Jansen to learn more. Bart, thanks for making the time.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Bart, let's just start here. Can you remind us what allegedly happened here with this classified information initially?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nCharges were unsealed earlier this year against National Guard Airman, a guy named Jack Teixeira in Massachusets, accusing him of basically hosting classified documents on a social media site called Discord, where he was chatting about world affairs and even current wars being waged, the Russian invasion in Ukraine and also North Korea's race to develop nuclear weapons. And so he's hosting what wound up being hundreds of documents on this social media site, basically to show what information is available. And it took the military months and months to not just discover, but then to stop the infraction.\n\nSo he has now been charged with six counts of willful retention of defense records. His federal criminal case is still pending. He has pleaded not guilty and that they had an update to discuss evidence sharing and when motions will be due. So we don't have a trial date, but he is in the criminal justice system at this point.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what did this investigation and report out this week reveal, Bart?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nSo the Air Force Inspector General took a look at what was going on with the situation at Otis National Guard Base up in Massachusetts and found that basically people noticed Teixeira looking at classified documents that appeared to be outside his realm of what he needed to know. He had security clearances but that he basically didn't need to know these different compartmentalized pieces of information. But so after some people noticed that he was looking at this information and posting it as early as February of 2022, they would notice maybe they would pass it along, he'd get scolded. There'd be maybe a memo placed in his file, but that it never got passed along to the security officials. And this happened several times until finally this year, the leadership at the base passed along the information to security officials, then it got investigated thoroughly. That's how you get the charges. The FBI wound up arresting and charging him.\n\nAnd so this Inspector General's report was to examine what was going on in the military chain of command. And the report found a lack of adequate supervision over Teixeira, and also a culture of complacency in dealing with these top secret documents dealing with current military battles and even locations of troops. It was stuff that the government wants to keep secret, that the Air Force says, \"It's our duty for the military to keep secret,\" and they were just getting spread around on a social media site.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Bart, are any new punishments coming as a result of this report?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, the report told us that 15 members of the military have been disciplined in this investigation, that different disciplinary and administrative actions began to be taken September 7th against people ranging in rank from a staff Sergeant up to Colonel, basically for dereliction of their duties. I guess the highest ranking would be Colonel Sean Riley, the Commander of the 102nd Intelligence Wing, was relieved of that command and he also received some administrative action.\n\nThe report doesn't detail what all punishment was meted out to all of the 15, but 15 people have been disciplined. And so there is some reaction. The Air Force says it has initiated more training, more awareness of how to handle secret documents and how to report a problem if you notice something's going wrong. They say they've taken many steps in reaction to this infraction, this oversight now criminal federal charges. And so Air Force Secretary, Frank Kendall, says it's a breach of the nation's sacred trust to give away the country's secrets and that they want to ensure that this information doesn't fall into the hands of people who would try to do us harm.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Bart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA Today. Thank you, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA federal law that went into effect in 2021 is designed to prevent surprise medical costs. The price transparency law requires that hospitals post cash prices and rates negotiated with insurers for a broad list of procedures in a computer readable format so the results can be analyzed, but price comparisons have been hard to come by until now. A free searchable database launched this week by a consumer non-profit compiles pricing data for nearly 6,000 US hospitals. The Patient Rights Advocate or PRA hospital price files finder aims to empower patients. PRA officials noted that the majority of healthcare is non-emergency and that consumers should have time and resources to shop and compare prices before undergoing a procedure. The new tool comes as around 100,000,000 Americans are in medical debt.\n\n♦\n\nThe Golden Globe nominations are out. And after dominating the summer box office, Barbenheimer looks poised to do the same in award season. Yesterday, Barbie earned nine nominations, including Best Comedy or Musical, while Margot Robbie was nominated for Best Actress. In the atomic bomb-centered biopic, Oppenheimer scored Best Drama as part of its eight nominations. It'll have to battle out Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon in the drama category. That film grabbed seven total nominations.\n\nThe Golden Globes have had a tumultuous few years. In 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported that none of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association's 87 voting journalists were black, spurring studios and publicists to threaten a boycott. NBC dropped the Globes amid the controversy, but aired the 2023 edition after the HFPA took steps to address representation in the group. You can find a full list of this year's nominees with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nThanks for listening to The Excerpt.

In his first Oval Office appearance, before heading to inaugural balls, he signs an executive order directing agencies to find ways to \"ease the burden\" of Obamacare.\n\nDay 2: Jan. 21\n\nTrump makes an appearance at CIA headquarters, expressing his support for the intelligence community while attacking the media for reporting that he had a \"feud\" with them over investigations into Russian hacking and the election. He also criticizes media coverage of his inauguration, echoed later by press secretary Sean Spicer in an angry briefing room debut. Meanwhile, millions of people join Women's March protests around the world, including in Washington.\n\nDay 3: Jan. 22\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets touting his inauguration TV ratings and weighing in on the weekend protests against him: \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Top aide Kellyanne Conway makes waves with a Meet the Press appearance in which she says Spicer \"gave alternative facts\" in his press briefing in regard to inauguration crowd sizes.\n\nDay 4: Jan. 23\n\nTrump signs three presidential directives: withdrawing U.S. support for a Pacific trade deal; imposing a hiring freeze in civilian agencies; and restoring the so-called Mexico City policy that prohibits U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. In a meeting with congressional leaders, Trump revives claims of voter fraud, blaming his popular vote loss on 3 million to 5 million people voting illegally.\n\nDay 5: Jan. 24\n\nTrump signs five executive actions on energy and infrastructure projects, including two memoranda intended to expedite the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. In a late-night tweet, he references plans to address one of his key campaign promises the following day: \"Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!\"\n\nDay 6: Jan. 25\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets vowing a \"major investigation\" into alleged voter fraud. In the afternoon, he visits the Department of Homeland Security and signs executive actions aimed at building a wall on the Mexican border and clamping down on \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nDay 7: Jan. 26\n\nTrump floats a proposal for a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to pay for his planned border wall. His plans for the wall drive a divide between the two countries and lead Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to cancel a meeting between the two leaders. Trump takes his first Air Force One ride, traveling to Philadelphia to speak at the GOP congressional retreat.\n\nDay 8: Jan. 27\n\nTrump has an hourlong phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. He has his first official meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. During their news conference, Trump declines to say whether he supports a reduction of sanctions against Russia. He visits the Pentagon to charge his new Defense secretary with rebuilding the military and announce an executive action to clamp down on refugee admissions in the U.S.\n\nDay 9: Jan. 28\n\nTrump's executive order from the previous evening — which suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, bans all immigrants from seven Muslim countries for 90 days, and orders the administration to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures — causes reverberations across the country, with stranded travelers, airport protests and legal challenges. The president makes a round of phone calls to world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also signs more executive orders: one to reorganize the National Security Council, another to strengthen ethics rules for the executive branch, and a third directing the military to present him a plan to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nDay 10: Jan. 29\n\nTrump, the target of protests, lawsuits and global criticism over his new refugee policy, takes to social media to defend it as a counter-terrorism measure. Some congressional Republicans suggest the order may have been too broad and hastily written. The president also faces blowback after giving chief strategist Steve Bannon an elevated role on the National Security Council.\n\nDay 11: Jan. 30\n\nAmid continued criticism over his temporary travel ban, Trump says that stopping terrorism involves hard choices and adds that he's following through on campaign pledges. Former president Barack Obama's office releases a statement that applauds those protesting the ban. That evening, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, says she won't defend the president’s travel ban in court. Three hours later, the White House announces that she's been relieved of her duties.\n\nDay 12: Jan. 31\n\nThe morning after firing his acting attorney general, Trump mocks his Democratic congressional critics and demands that the Senate confirm his attorney general pick, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. He meets with drugmakers and pledges to cut taxes and streamline regulations for the pharmaceutical industry in a bid to drive down drug prices. The president caps off the day with his long-awaited Supreme Court nomination, announcing his selection of Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDay 13: Feb. 1\n\nTrump says the Senate should \"go nuclear\" and eliminate Democratic filibuster rights if that's what it takes to confirm Gorsuch. His nomination of Betsy DeVos for Education secretary takes a hit when two Republican senators say they'll vote against her. The president makes an unannounced trip to a Delaware military base to receive the remains of a Navy SEAL killed during a counter-terrorism raid.\n\nDay 14: Feb. 2\n\nIn remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump references leaked conversations between himself and Mexican and Australian leaders, telling attendees not to worry about his \"tough phone calls\" and that the country has to be \"tougher\" in meeting its challenges. He raises eyebrows by also asking for prayers for his Apprentice successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the show's ratings, which Trump said have gone \"down the tubes\" in his absence. And he vows to make good on his promise to overturn the so-called Johnson Amendment, which bans public charities — including churches — from campaigning for or against a candidate for elected office.\n\nDay 15: Feb. 3\n\nThe Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Tehran government's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen.

People pouring in. Bad!\" As the Justice Department appeals the judge's decision, Trump also tweets that he has \"instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\"\n\nDay 18: Feb. 6\n\nAs an appeals court reviews his travel ban, Trump claims that the public is with him, despite polls indicating otherwise. \"Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election,\" Trump tweets. \"Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\" In a visit to the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Trump tells troops he is 100% behind them in the fight against \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and claims that \"in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report\" on terrorist attacks.\n\nDay 19: Feb. 7\n\nTrump tells a group of county sheriffs that he will help them fight terrorism and illegal immigration, and he vows to take his travel ban all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. DeVos is confirmed as Education secretary after a contentious battle in the Senate, with Vice President Pence breaking a 50-50 tie vote.

Elizabeth Warren is silenced by the GOP during a speech for \"impugning\" Sessions.\n\nDay 21: Feb. 9\n\nTrump accuses Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., of distorting what Gorsuch said about the president's attacks on judges, even though administration officials and fellow senators confirm the gist of Gorsuch's comments. The president also uses Twitter to attack Sen. John McCain over his criticism of the White House calling the Yemen raid a “huge success.\" Watchdog groups file ethics complaints against Conway for promoting Ivanka Trump's fashion line during a TV interview. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit weighs in that evening, refusing to reinstate Trump's travel ban.\n\nDay 22: Feb. 10\n\nIn a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan but says both countries need to contribute more to military cooperation. He says he’ll take action the following week to strengthen border security in the wake of the appeals court ruling against his travel ban, but he declines to specify what that action might be. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Virginia blasts his travel ban, citing a lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represent a specific threat.\n\nDay 23: Feb. 11\n\nTrump golfs with Abe at Trump National Jupiter Golf Club in Florida, while Melania Trump and Abe’s wife, Akie, spend the morning touring the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Palm Beach County. It's a relatively quiet day for the president on Twitter, with Trump vowing that cost estimates for his border wall will \"come WAY DOWN\" once he is involved with design and negotiations.\n\nDay 24: Feb. 12\n\nTrump takes to Twitter in the morning to again defend his travel ban. In Sunday show appearances, policy adviser Stephen Miller says the president is assessing all of his legal options on the ban, ranging from appealing to the Supreme Court to revising the executive order.\n\nDay 25: Feb. 13\n\nAfter a day filled with mounting questions and criticism, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns, citing \"incomplete information\" that he provided White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. Earlier that day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits the White House. Trump pledges \"bridges of commerce\" with Canada and says he wants relatively minor changes to NAFTA, adding that most of his problems with the trade deal involve the third partner, Mexico.\n\nDay 26: Feb. 14\n\nIn the aftermath of Flynn's exit, Spicer says Trump knew for more than two weeks that Flynn lied about his contact with a Russian ambassador and demanded his resignation because he could no longer trust him. That night, The New York Times reports that phone records and intercepted calls show members of Trump's campaign team \"had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\"\n\nDay 27: Feb. 15\n\nAmid the renewed questions about contacts between Trump's associates and Russia regarding the 2016 election, the president denounces \"conspiracy theories\" about his relationship with the Russians and said \"illegal\" news leaks brought down Flynn. Trump hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a series of meetings. Andrew Puzder, the president’s embattled pick to become Labor secretary, withdraws his nomination.\n\nDay 28: Feb. 16\n\nIn a lengthy, fiery, wide-ranging news conference, Trump defends his administration as a \"fine-tuned machine,\" laments the \"mess\" he inherited from his predecessor and excoriates the \"fake news\" media. He says he asked Flynn to resign because he misled Pence about his phone calls to the Russian ambassador, but Trump says he didn't believe Flynn did anything wrong by making the calls and faults leakers for providing contents of the intercepted calls to the media.\n\nDay 29: Feb. 17\n\nThe Associated Press reports on the details of an internal Department of Homeland Security memo from January that proposes calling up as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up undocumented immigrants; it draws an angry response from the White House, with Spicer calling the AP report \"100% not true\" and insisting the memo is “not a White House document.” Trump conducts his first presidential visit beyond the Beltway with a stop in the Boeing facility in North Charleston, S.C., where he stresses his \"America First\" trade and economic policies.\n\nDay 30: Feb. 18\n\nTrump kicks off his third straight weekend at Mar-a-Lago seeking to calm reports of turmoil within his administration. \"Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it,\" he tweets that morning. He holds a campaign-style rally in the evening in Melbourne, Fla.\n\nDay 31: Feb. 19\n\nTrump is ridiculed for apparently denouncing a non-existent terrorist attack in Sweden in his rally the night before but says he was referring to a Fox News report on violence in Sweden allegedly perpetrated by refugees. In New York City, more than a thousand people protest Trump's travel ban in the \"I Am A Muslim Too\" rally.\n\nDay 32: Feb. 20\n\nAcross the country, anti-Trump activists mark Presidents Day with “Not My Presidents Day” protests.

The president, while meeting with budget officials, doesn't give specifics, but he tells reporters that \"our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable” and “we must do a lot more with less.” Later that evening, the Trump administration issues new guidance on transgender students' restroom use, rolling back the policies put in place by the Obama administration last year.\n\nDay 35: Feb. 23\n\nTrump meets with manufacturing executives at the White House and later holds a listening session on human trafficking. The Conservative Political Action Conference kicks off just outside of Washington. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Bannon make a joint appearance at the annual confab, in which they dispute media reports casting them as rivals and say they are working together to advance the president's agenda.\n\nDay 36: Feb. 24\n\nTrump starts off the day criticizing FBI \"leakers\" as he and aides push back on news reports that his chief of staff asked the bureau to \"knock down\" stories about investigations into possible contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. At his CPAC speech later that morning, Trump launches into a full-throated attack on journalism, saying some reporters make up unnamed sources for \"fake news\" and describing the media as \"the enemy\" of the American people. News organizations protest a White House decision that afternoon to hold a news briefing by invitation only.\n\nDay 37: Feb. 25\n\nThe president takes to Twitter in the morning with further complaints about the media. “The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo,” he tweets. In the evening, he announces via Twitter that he will not attend the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April.\n\nDay 38: Feb. 26\n\nThe president tweets that the Democratic National Committee election \"was of course, totally 'rigged' \" and takes another swing at the media, tweeting, \"Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!\" In the evening, Trump hosts the nation's governors for an annual dinner at the White House.\n\nDay 39: Feb. 27\n\nTrump signs off on top-line numbers in a budget outline that bolsters military spending while making deep cuts to other federal agencies. \"This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government,\" he says. \"We're going to do more with less.\" The president rejects the idea of a special prosecutor to look into Russian connections during the election and says, “I haven’t called Russia in 10 years.\"\n\nDay 40: Feb. 28\n\nTrump uses his first address to Congress to proclaim American greatness and push an ambitious agenda of economic nationalism, declaring, \"The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\" He opens the possibility of a comprehensive immigration deal, pitches $1 trillion for \"Buy American, Hire American\" infrastructure spending, and says he will propose \"historic\" tax cuts. Earlier that day, the president signs executive orders targeting a water-protection rule and elevating an initiative on historically black colleges and universities.\n\nDay 41: March 1\n\nA day after Trump struck a more conciliatory tone in his address to Congress, critics predict he'll revert back to the more combative and divisive approach that characterized much of his first month in office. Aides, however, say the president is focused on enacting his campaign agenda. White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino says in a letter that Conway did nothing \"nefarious\" when she promoted Ivanka Trump's fashion line on television and that a White House inquiry \"concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again.\"\n\nDay 42: March 2\n\nThe news of Sessions' 2016 meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his testimony during his confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russian government during the campaign, dominates the day. Trump says he \"wasn't aware at all\" of the meetings. Speaking to reporters during a tour of the USS Gerald Ford in Newport News, Va., the president says he still had \"total\" confidence in his attorney general. Later that afternoon, Session recuses himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nDay 43: March 3\n\nSeeking to get past stories about Sessions and Russia, Trump spends the day visiting a school in Florida. He uses Twitter to express his displeasure with Democrats, knocking them over his full Cabinet having not yet been approved and calling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer a \"hypocrite\" in a tweet displaying a 2003 photo of Schumer and Putin.\n\nDay 44: March 4\n\nIn a morning tweetstorm, Trump accuses Obama of wiretapping him at Trump Tower prior to the November election: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" the president tweets. An Obama spokesman rejects the accusation as \"simply false.\" Thousands of Trump supporters convene near Trump Tower and in other cities around the U.S. in what organizers bill as \"March 4 Trump\" demonstrations on behalf of the president.\n\nDay 45: March 5\n\nIn the morning, the president calls for a congressional investigation of his claims that Obama had him wiretapped during the election — while critics accuse Trump of trying to distract from the investigation into his own relationship with Russia. That evening, news reports indicate that FBI Director James Comey over the weekend sought a public rebuke from the Justice Department of Trump's wiretapping claim.\n\nDay 46: March 6\n\nTrump issues the long-awaited revised version of his travel ban, which no longer restricts travel from Iraq, one of the seven majority Muslim countries listed in his original order. The new order, set to take effect 10 days afterward, includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen as part of the 90-day ban. Meanwhile, when White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders is asked on ABC's Good Morning America whether the president accepts Comey's statement that Obama did not authorize any wiretaps, she says: \"You know, I don't think he does.\"\n\nDay 47: March 7\n\nTrump kicks off the day by using Twitter to again bash Obama — this time in a false claim about Guantanamo Bay prisoner releases. He also denies reports of dissension within his staff. \"Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin,\" the president tweets. He praises the House GOP health care bill amid pushback from conservatives attacking the new plan. \"We're going to do something that is great,\" the president says during a meeting with House deputy whips. The plan is \"complicated, but it's very simple ... it's called good health care.\"\n\nDay 48: March 8\n\nWhile refusing to confirm or deny the authenticity of CIA documents released by WikiLeaks, Spicer says that \"this alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security\" and says there's a \"massive, massive difference\" between exposing the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other Democratic officials, and leaking national security secrets. The president dines with former foe Sen. Ted Cruz. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse send a letter to the FBI director and acting deputy attorney general asking for specific information on Trump's wiretapping accusation against Obama.\n\nDay 49: March 9\n\nTrump meets with his National Economic Council and representatives of community banks. As GOP leaders try to quell concerns about the new health care legislation, the president tweets, \"Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!\" Meanwhile, legal challenges mount from several states for Trump's revised travel ban.\n\nDay 50: March 10\n\nAs the president reaches the halfway point of his first 100 days, administration officials kick off a plan to use social media and interviews to promote \"50 days of action.\" Trump meets with House committee leaders and predicts a fairly rapid approval of the GOP health care bill. \"This is the time we’re going to get it done,\" he says. \"I think it’s just something that’s going to happen very shortly.\" He welcomes a better-than-expected jobs report showing that the economy added 235,000 jobs the previous month.\n\nDay 51: March 11\n\nTrump has lunch with a group of White House staff and Cabinet members at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. His administration moves forward with plans to dismiss 46 U.S. attorneys held over from the Obama administration amid criticism, and news reports emerge that an intruder was arrested on the White House grounds after scaling a fence the previous evening.\n\nDay 52: March 12\n\nTrump administration officials mount a vigorous defense of their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare while bracing for what could be a skeptical assessment from the Congressional Budget Office the next day. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price says the bill would lead to \"more people covered than are covered right now, and at an average cost that is less.\"\n\nDay 53: March 13\n\nThe CBO releases its analysis of the GOP health plan, determining that the bill would lead to 14 million fewer Americans with insurance by 2018 and 24 million by 2026. Price calls the projections \"just not believable.\" Trump launches an ambitious effort to reorganize the federal government, signing an executive order that he said would \"make it less wasteful and more productive.\"\n\nDay 54: March 14\n\nA senior White House official confirms that Trump paid $38 million in taxes in 2005 on an income of more than $150 million. The rare acknowledgement came in anticipation of a report by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in which she disclosed a portion of the return. The news capped off an otherwise relatively quite day for the president during which Spicer pushed back against the CBO analysis of the Obamacare repeal and Trump hosted the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia for lunch in the State Dining Room.\n\nDay 55: March 15\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii issues a nationwide halt to Trump's second travel ban. Earlier that day, the president spars on Twitter with journalist David Cay Johnston over the previous night's leaked tax return, tweeting, \"Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, 'went to his mailbox' and found my tax returns?\" Trump also travels to Detroit to speak to autoworkers before heading to a rally in Nashville.\n\nDay 56: March 16\n\nIn his first formal budget proposal to Congress, Trump seeks to increase defense spending by $54 billion and offsets that with cuts to non-defense spending, including steep cuts to education, environmental protection, health and human services and foreign aid. Senate Intelligence Committee leaders say in a statement that there are \"no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance,\" a day after the House Intelligence panel offered a similar assessment. Trump also meets with Irish leader Enda Kenny and attends the Friends of Ireland Luncheon on Capitol Hill.\n\nDay 57: March 17\n\nDisputing media reports that the GOP health care bill is in political trouble, Trump says he is \"100% behind\" the plan and is working with skeptical conservatives. He welcomes German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House after months of back-and-forth between the two leaders. During their news conference, Trump again defends his surveillance allegations. \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" he says, referencing past disclosures during the Obama administration that Merkel's cellphone had been monitored.\n\nDay 58: March 18\n\nThe president spends the weekend at Mar-a-Lago. In a pair of morning tweets, Trump lashes out at the media and Germany: \"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes ... vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\" Meanwhile, at the White House, the Secret Service apprehends a person who jumped a bike rack near the security perimeter.\n\nDay 59: March 19\n\nA day before a high-stakes hearing featuring Comey's testimony, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say on Sunday talk shows that there's no evidence to back Trump's claims that Obama wiretapped him, though the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, says investigators are looking at other types of possible surveillance of Trump and his aides during the campaign.\n\nDay 60: March 20\n\nAppearing before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey says the FBI and DOJ have \"no information to support’’ Trump’s assertions that Obama wiretapped him, and he also confirms for the first time publicly that the FBI is investigating Russian interference in the election. Trump heads to Kentucky to take part in a rally to build support for the GOP health care bill.\n\nDay 61: March 21\n\nThe morning after congressional Republicans released a modified version of their health care legislation seeking to win more conservative votes, Trump meets with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, emphasizing how important it is that they stay united to pass the legislation. The president also signs a $19.5 billion bill to fund NASA programs and reaffirm what he called a \"national commitment\" to \"human space exploration.\"\n\nDay 62: March 22\n\nThe White House dismisses a report that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, received a $10 million contract a decade ago to advance the interests of Putin. Nunes says communications involving members of Trump's transition group were \"incidentally collected'' by intelligence officials after the election. The president meets with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and negotiations continue over the looming health care vote in the House.\n\nDay 63: March 23\n\nIn a setback to Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan's efforts to repeal Obamacare, the House postpones its vote on the bill as negotiations continue with both conservative and moderate groups. The president touts the House Intelligence chairman's assertion that spy agencies engaged in \"incidental collection\" of Trump associates' communications, saying it's evidence to support his claim that Obama \"wiretapped\" Trump Tower. Trump also holds a listening session on health care at the White House with truckers and trucking CEOs.\n\nDay 64: March 24\n\nAs the Obamacare repeal bill bleeds GOP support ahead of its rescheduled vote, Ryan pulls the legislation from consideration — a major bump in the road for Trump's campaign promise to repeal and replace the health care law. The president blames the bill's failure on the lack of Democratic support. Earlier that day, Trump signs a permit to allow the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it \"a great day for American jobs.\"\n\nDay 65: March 25\n\nThe morning after Republicans' Obamacare repeal plan fell apart in Congress, Trump tweets, \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\" The president stays in the D.C. area for the weekend, venturing to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va.\n\nDay 66: March 26\n\nTrump takes aim at the House Freedom Caucus in a morning tweet: \"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\" In Sunday show appearances, Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney say Trump has not blamed Ryan for the failure of the Obamacare repeal bill.\n\nDay 67: March 27\n\nTrump taps son-in-law Jared Kushner to lead a new White House office designed to bring ideas from the private sector into the federal government. The president rolls back more Obama-era regulations, signing four bills that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing, and he holds a meeting at the White House with female small-business owners.\n\nDay 68: March 28\n\nTrump signs an executive order on energy independence, a sweeping repudiation of Obama-era environmental initiatives that substitutes a strategy of combating climate change through international cooperation for an America-first energy policy. Nunes faces pressure to recuse himself or step down as leader of the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDay 69: March 29\n\nThe president kicks off the day with complaints on Twitter about the media. \"Remember when the failing @nytimes apologized to its subscribers, right after the election, because their coverage was so wrong. Now worse!\" he tweets. Trump later holds an opioid abuse listening session, joined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, leader of the White House's new commission to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nDay 70: March 30\n\nTrump takes to Twitter to threaten the conservative group that opposed him on health care: \"The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! \" Later that day, The New York Times reports that two White House officials played a role in providing intelligence reports to Nunes. The president meets with Denmark’s prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen.\n\nDay 71: March 31\n\nWhile Trump encourages Flynn to offer testimony to investigators in exchange for immunity, congressional leaders investigating Russia's interference in the election signal that it's too early to consider such an agreement. Trump promises to crack down on \"foreign importers that cheat\" with two executive orders that he said would lead to a historic reversal of the nation's trade deficit.\n\nDay 72: April 1\n\nTrump kicks off another Saturday with tweets attacking the media, with NBC's Chuck Todd as the target: \"When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?\" The president also uses Twitter to praise a New York Times article on Obamacare, though he still describes the newspaper as \"failing.\"\n\nDay 73: April 2\n\nTrump expresses confidence, both on social media and at the golf course, that he and aides can resurrect their attempt to repeal Obamacare. Before hitting the links with one of his critics on health care, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, the president tweets: \"Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!\"\n\nDay 74: April 3\n\nTrump welcomes Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to the White House, praises him for doing a \"fantastic job,\" and solicits his help in the fight against terrorism. The president donates $78,333.32 — his salary since taking office — to the National Park Service. Senate Democrats reach the threshold required to block Gorsuch's confirmation, setting up a major Senate rules change later in the week for the GOP to advance the Supreme Court nomination.\n\nDay 75: April 4\n\nFormer national security adviser Susan Rice, appearing on MSNBC, says she didn't seek to \"unmask\" the names of Trump associates for political purposes. Meanwhile, in a statement on a chemical attack in Syria, Trump blames the Assad regime and calls it a consequence of the Obama administration’s “weakness and irresolution.” The president promotes his \"America First\" domestic plan at the North America’s Building Trades Unions national legislative conference.\n\nDay 76: April 5\n\nA senior White House official confirms Trump has removed Bannon from the National Security Council and says Bannon was given the post as a check on Flynn. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump floats the possibility that Rice committed a crime, but he provides no evidence. In a news conference with Jordan's King Abdullah, the president denounces the chemical attack in Syria and suggests his administration will develop a new policy toward Bashar al-Assad's government.\n\nDay 77: April 6\n\nTrump orders a cruise missile strike against Syria, saying \"no child of God should ever suffer\" the horror of the chemical weapons attack Syria launched on its own people. Earlier that day, Trump meets with Wounded Warriors at the White House before heading to Mar-a-Lago to host a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Senate Republicans invoke the \"nuclear option\" to strip Democrats of their power to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed.\n\nDay 78: April 7\n\nTrump's decision to strike Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack draws wide political support, though some lawmakers say he should have consulted with Congress, while Russia said the strike would undermine international cooperation. The president concludes his meetings with the Chinese president at Mar-a-Lago, and his Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDay 79: April 8\n\nTrump does not rule out additional military action against Syria, telling Congress that he was acting \"in the vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States\" when he ordered the launch of cruise missiles at a Syrian air field. He provides his justification in a letter to Congress under the War Powers Resolution. Kushner and Bannon hold a negotiation session to try to mend a rift that triggered speculation about a White House staff shakeup.\n\nDay 80: April 9\n\nAdministration officials confirm that Trump will ask K.T. McFarland to step down as deputy national security adviser and serve instead as ambassador to Singapore, giving McMaster a chance to pick his own lieutenant. The president heads back to D.C. in the afternoon following a weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 81: April 10\n\nTrump takes part in the swearing-in ceremony for Gorsuch. The White House echoes its threat of additional missile strikes against Syria if Assad's government again uses chemical weapons, and Trump aides say the administration is reworking its tax reform plan and doesn't know whether it can put together a final proposal before Congress' August recess.\n\nDay 82: April 11\n\nSpicer makes waves during the daily briefing when he states, while comparing Assad and Adolf Hitler, that Hitler \"didn't even use chemical weapons.\" He attempts to clarify by saying Hitler \"was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.\" In a second attempt to clarify, he says he was \"trying to draw a contrast of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on innocent people.\" Meanwhile, the White House says there's overwhelming evidence that Syria used a sarin nerve agent to attack opponents of the government and that Russia is trying to help Assad's government cover up the illegal use of chemical weapons.\n\nDay 83: April 12\n\nTrump meets with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and says at a press conference afterward that he's satisfied that NATO has responded to the criticism he leveled at it during his campaign: \"I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.\" He also says relations with Russia \"may be at an all-time low\" following Syria's use of chemical weapons the previous week and the U.S. airstrike that followed.\n\nDay 84: April 13\n\nThe U.S. military announces an attack on an Islamic State tunnel complex in Afghanistan, and Trump says he endorsed the strike. Asked about the use of the \"mother of all bombs,\" Trump says \"what I do is I authorize my military. ... We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing and frankly that’s why they’ve been so successful lately.\" The president tweets on foreign policy, including on North Korea: \"I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A.\"\n\nDay 85: April 14\n\nTrump hits the golf course at Mar-a-Lago as he and his aides braced for what North Korea calls a \"big event.\" Administration officials say they are hopeful that China can dissuade its communist neighbor from conducting a nuclear explosion or a missile test. The Trump administration says records of visitors to the White House will stay secret until at least five years after Trump leaves office, a reversal of policy quickly denounced by advocates of transparent government.\n\nDay 86: April 15\n\nNorth Korea attempts to launch a new missile, but the device blows up almost immediately. Pence arrives in Seoul hours after the failed missile test and says U.S. resolve to support and defend South Korea is unwavering \"in these troubled times.\" Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gather in U.S. cities for Tax Day rallies and marches, demanding that Trump release his tax returns.\n\nDay 87: April 16\n\nThe Trump administration takes a low-key approach to the previous day's failed missile test in North Korea and continues to express hope that China will rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor. The president says he's unimpressed with tax protests over the weekend and indicates he has no plans to release his tax returns anytime soon. \"Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!\" Trump tweets. He returns to D.C. after spending Easter weekend in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 88: April 17\n\nTrump marks his first Easter Egg Roll by defending his record in office. \"We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before and we are right on track,\" he says during remarks on the South Portico balcony. The White House declines to detail Trump's future strategy toward North Korea, even as its government threatens more missile tests. \"I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate this president will take decisive action,\" Spicer says.\n\nDay 89: April 18\n\nTrump heads to Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis., to speak about manufacturing and sign a \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order. The order clamps down on guest worker visas and requires agencies to buy more goods and services from U.S. companies and workers. Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington expands a lawsuit against the president, adding new plaintiffs who claim they are hurt by the \"unfair\" advantage he enjoys in the hotel and restaurant industry.\n\nDay 90: April 19\n\nWith the closely watched special election in Georgia headed to a runoff, Trump pats himself on the back: \"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \"R\" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!\" he tweets. He signs the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act and welcomes the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House.\n\nDay 91: April 20\n\nThe Trump administration launches an investigation into whether steel imports threaten national security, a move aimed at China's growing dominance in steel production. The president welcomes Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni to the White House. During their joint press conference, Trump says he's confident he can block North Korea's nuclear program, get a health care bill though the House, and avoid a looming government shutdown.\n\nDay 92: April 21\n\nWith a little over a week before Trump hits the 100-day mark of his presidency, he tweets, \"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\" Trump aims to dismantle even more financial regulations with executive orders, directing Treasury officials to take another look at tax rules and oversight of \"too big to fail\" financial institutions. The president also says he intends to unveil a tax reform plan the following week.\n\nDay 93: April 22\n\nTrump announces his plans for the night of the annual dinner of White House correspondents — and the 100th day of his presidency. \"Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!\" he tweets. He makes his his first official visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, awarding a Purple Heart to a soldier injured in Afghanistan. People take part in protests across the country as part of the the March for Science.\n\nDay 94: April 23\n\nAs the 100-day mark approaches, Trump and his staff plan a busy week of events — including a new tax reform outline, a renewed effort to get a health care bill through the House, a high-profile National Rifle Association speech and a 100th day rally in Pennsylvania — all topped by the need for a new spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nDay 95: April 24\n\nTrump speaks with astronauts aboard the International Space Station, lauding NASA's work and praising a crew member who set a record for longest time spent in space. As his administration slaps new sanctions on Syria, Trump tells a group of U.N. diplomats that they need to work harder to confront the Syrian government and other \"serious and growing threats\" such as North Korea. He attempts to atone for past blunders on the history of the Holocaust with a strongly worded Week of Remembrance proclamation, pledging that \"we must never forget\" the annihilation of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany.\n\nDay 96: April 25\n\nTrump vows to fight anti-Semitic violence during a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol to commemorate the memory of the Holocaust. \"Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil, and we will never be silent,\" Trump says. Later that day, the president expresses confidence that he'll be able to build a wall along the Southwest border but stops short of saying whether he would insist that money to finance the barrier be included in a new spending bill to keep the government open past the end of the week.\n\nDay 97: April 26\n\nTrump signs an executive order calling into question the future of more than two dozen national monuments proclaimed by the last three presidents to set aside millions of acres from development. The administration pitches a tax reform outline calling for big corporate rate cuts, a simpler tax code and big increases in standard deductions. After briefing senators at a White House meeting, members of Trump's national security team said they're trying to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons program by cutting off foreign money they need to finance it.\n\nDay 98: April 27\n\nTrump signs an executive order seeking to provide more protections to whistle-blowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs.

He heads to Atlanta to speak at the National Rifle Association convention, where he vows to defend gun rights and reminisces about his election victory.\n\nDay 100: April 29\n\nTrump is set to hold a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pa., as White House correspondents hold their annual dinner in Washington that is traditionally attended by the president.\n\nContributing: Katie Smith, David Jackson, Gregory Korte, Donovan Slack\n\nUSA TODAY coverage of Trump's first 100 days:\n\n100 days into Trump presidency, Americans are united on this: They're divided\n\nTrump’s 5 biggest wins and losses in Congress in his first 100 days\n\nOne Republican congressman's wild ride on the Trump train\n\nIn Gettysburg speech, Trump made 100 days of promises.

Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\n\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\n\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\n\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\n\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\n\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\n\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.\n\nFinal question\n\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump..

And that he liked to ride a skateboard in the halls. Nearly a year after British police officers dragged him – heavily bearded, disheveled and resisting – into a waiting van, the cramped quarters where he spent seven years avoiding the long reach of the U.S. Justice Department still retain the odor of cat litter from his trusted feline companion.\n\nA court hearing that began here Feb. 24 could determine whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who published classified U.S. government communications as well as emails hacked by Russia from Hilary Clinton’s failed 2016 presidential campaign, will continue to be confined – and if so, where and how.\n\nThe hearing will decide whether Assange is sent to the U.S. to face trial in a case that could have serious implications for First Amendment protections. Yet the core issues at stake – media freedoms in the digital age and the global limits of the U.S. justice system – have been obscured by Assange's personal life, by the refuge he sought in Ecuador's London embassy and by curious claims about his behavior not that well supported.\n\nAssange extradition:Hearing opens with claims of Trump retribution against media\n\nSince May, the Australian national, 48, has been locked up at Belmarsh Prison, a facility that houses some of Britain's most dangerous lawbreakers.\n\nAssange is there because he was found guilty of skipping bail in 2012; he fled to Ecuador's embassy rather than turn himself in to British authorities for possible extradition to Sweden. At the time, investigators in the Scandinavian country wanted to question him over sexual assault allegations connected to two women.\n\n'Evidence has weakened':Julian Assange's rape investigation dropped by Sweden\n\nAssange hid from British police in Ecuador's poky red-brick embassy building, just yards from the famous luxury Harrods department store, because he feared Sweden would, in turn, extradite him to the U.S. The Department of Justice has indicted him on 18 counts, alleging 17 forms of espionage and 1 instance of computer misuse crimes connected to WikiLeaks' dissemination of caches of secret U.S. military documents provided to him by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.\n\nAssange denies all the allegations. The Swedish case has since been dropped. In Britain, he was sentenced to 50 weeks in prison for jumping bail, a period he has already served. He has been denied bail for his extradition hearing because he is considered a flight risk.\n\nBut there's more at stake than one anti-secrecy advocate's freedom.\n\nShocking detail\n\nJohn Kiriakou, a former CIA analyst who blew the whistle on a U.S. government-sanctioned torture program in 2007 that was approved by President George W. Bush because of the feared threats posed by the al-Qaeda terrorist organization, said that Assange's U.S. case could set a precedent that would erode press freedoms for news organizations that publish classified information.\n\n\"If you are able to prosecute someone who has a strong case to be called a publisher, then who's next?\" said Kiriakou, who served jail time after pleading guilty to leaking the name of an officer involved in waterboarding.\n\nAssange describes himself as a political refugee.\n\nHe maintains that as a journalist he should be immune from prosecution and that his work revealed embarrassing and highly damaging facts about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the detainees held at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nAssange's detractors say he doesn't write stories or interview anyone or provide sufficient explanatory context and that the dissemination of raw, unfiltered documents and data – the publication of stolen classified materials – should not count as journalism.\n\n\"WikiLeaks walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service,\" then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo, now the U.S. secretary of State, said in April 2017, in his first public speech as head of the spy agency. \"Assange and his ilk,\" Pompeo said, seek \"personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values.\"\n\nIn fact, Department of Justice officials in President Barack Obama's administration ultimately decided they could not prosecute Assange for revealing national security secrets, described as one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history, because it risked criminalizing subsequent national security journalism.\n\n\"During the Obama administration it was called 'the New York Times problem,' \" after the newspaper's distinguished record of publishing information on national security matters the U.S. government has deemed secret, said Stephen Rohde, a historian and constitutional law expert, and a past chair of the Southern California branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. \"In other words, how can we indict him for espionage when we're confident he's a journalist, a publisher and enjoys First Amendment rights.\"\n\nGenerally speaking, the First Amendment, as it applies to the press, restrains the government from jailing, fining or imposing liability for what the press publishes.\n\nIt does not shield journalists from criminal liability.\n\nOn the opening day of Assange's extradition hearing, James Lewis, a British lawyer representing the U.S. government, said Assange was guilty of \"straightforward\" criminality for hacking and then publishing secret military and intelligence information that put secret U.S. sources at risk of torture or death in places from Iraq to China.\n\nThe information Assange published contained about 90,000 Afghanistan War-related \"significant activity\" reports, 400,000 Iraq War-related reports, 800 Guantanamo Bay \"detainee assessment\" briefs and 250,000 U.S. State Department cables.\n\nIf nothing else, this material illuminated in shocking detail U.S. military and diplomatic procedure and actions in far-flung places, and the light it shined was not flattering.\n\nWikiLeaks' Julian Assange:Journalist or criminal hacker?\n\nTo his supporters, Assange is a champion of free speech and the public interest whose exceptional computer skills helped him reveal, among other things, video footage allegedly showing U.S. air crews in Apache helicopters killing a dozen civilians in Iraq.\n\nThe dead included two Iraqis working for the Reuters news agency.\n\n\"Assange published evidence of war crimes by the U.S. government,\" said Andrew Wilkie, a left-leaning Australian politician who traveled to Britain in February with fellow Australian lawmaker George Christensen in a show of bipartisan support for Assange. Christensen represents Australia's right-of-center Liberal National Party.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of the Trump administration but I'm a bigger fan of free speech,\" said Christensen.\n\n\"Assange did the right thing,\" added Wilkie. \"He served the public interest.\"\n\nStill, the U.S. government alleges that Assange is a criminal who conspired with Manning to steal thousands of pages of national defense information that has risked the lives of U.S. forces, allies and collaborators from translators to political dissidents with whom it partners to fight repressive regimes.\n\n\"No responsible actor – journalist or otherwise – would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers,\" U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said when the indictment was announced in May 2019.\n\nManning served seven years in prison, including pre-trial custody, before Obama commuted her 35-year prison sentence. She is now back in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. Manning, who was convicted of theft and espionage, says she acted on principle when she handed over the top-secret information to WikiLeaks.\n\nIf Assange is sent to the U.S. to stand trial, he could get a life sentence – 175 years – if a federal court finds him guilty on all 18 charges and the maximum penalty is imposed.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on whether there is any evidence that the WikiLeaks disclosures have directly led to injuries or deaths.\n\nTo date, no evidence of deaths or injuries precipitated by WikiLeaks' disclosures has emerged and Lewis, the lawyer representing the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, said that while Washington believes that many of its informants who were outed by WikiLeaks later \"disappeared\" it can't yet prove the assertion.\n\nJulian Assange:WikiLeaks founder claims ‘spying’ in fight over extradition\n\nSelf-imposed isolation?\n\nEcuador insists it kicked Assange out of its embassy after he became an intolerable nuisance at its building in one of London's most upmarket neighborhoods.\n\nWhile living there, Assange occupied about a third of the embassy's rooms with his cat. He brought in a sun lamp, treadmill, stacks of books, computer equipment and insisted on his own fridge. He also regularly hosted well-known guests such as the musician Lady Gaga and the actor Pamela Anderson. He addressed admirers and gave news conferences from the embassy's tiny balcony – often, as unsuspecting tourists passed by and expensive cars belonging to Harrods' wealthy patrons idled across the street. Due to space constraints, embassy staff had to share a conference room with Assange. One senior diplomat even shared an office with him.\n\nMost people have suffered through a houseguest from hell.\n\nOver time, Ecuador says, that's exactly what Assange became, even allegedly going to the unhygienic length of smearing his own excrement on a bathroom wall. The allegations were first made public in an interview in April 2019 with Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno, who also accused Assange of not looking after his cat and attacking the embassy's security staff. No evidence was released to back up the allegations.\n\nAssange's supporters and legal team strongly deny the claims, which have not been verified. Ecuadorean officials told USA TODAY that some evidence of Assange's misbehavior in the embassy can be found online, such as a YouTube video that shows him standing on a skateboard. Ecuador says it has not released additional evidence because of possible legal retribution from Assange.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the fact that Ecuador started to reexamine its relationship with Assange around the time Moreno took office in 2017. Moreno sought to improve relations with its largest trading partner: the U.S.\n\nIn fact, shortly after Assange was expelled from the embassy, President Donald Trump's administration said it was opening a \"new chapter of cooperation\" with the South American nation that included economic development and natural disasters help.\n\nAnd, cosmetically at least, Assange's expulsion from the Ecuadorean embassy does appear to mark a sea change in U.S.-Ecuador relations that was foreshadowed on Oct. 16, 2018, when the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs wrote a letter to Moreno offering to \"advance crucial matters\" and \"warmer relations\" with Washington if Ecuador \"handed over Assange to the proper authorities.\"\n\nIn February, Moreno became the first chief of state from Ecuador to visit an American president in 17 years. Moreno's predecessor, Rafael Correa, who granted Assange asylum and even Ecuadorean citizenship before it was revoked by Moreno, embraced Iran, closed a U.S. military base, expelled the U.S.'s ambassador and generally railed against what he described as belligerent American imperialism and capitalism.\n\nVegan meal:Pamela Anderson’s present for Julian Assange\n\nWhen USA TODAY visited Ecuador's London embassy in mid-February, some modest refurbishments and redecorations were underway. Officials pointed to the bathroom where they allege Assange spread feces on the wall and also showed off the hotel-style kitchenette where he prepared his meals. But citing legal action in Ecuador and Spain on Assange's behalf, over claims that a security company was contracted by Ecuador's government to spy on Assange while he lived in the embassy, these officials would not reveal further details about what led to Assange's departure. Assange has also tried to sue Ecuador's government for \"violating his fundamental rights,\" by claiming it limited his contact with the outside world while he was holed up there.\n\nEcuador disputes all the allegations and insists it has done nothing wrong.\n\nBritish press reported that his cat, who went by various names including \"Embassy Cat,\" \"Meowchael Moore,\" after the American documentary filmmaker, and \"James,\" was given to a shelter when Assange was forced out of the embassy by British police.\n\nThe YouTube video footage Ecuador cited as evidence for Assange's poor houseguest manners was uploaded to the video-sharing platform in April 2019. It shows a pale and barefooted Assange attempting to stand on a skateboard in a room in the embassy.\n\nHe repeatedly stumbles.\n\nA First Amendment brawl\n\nAssange has been indicted in the U.S. under the Espionage Act of 1917.\n\nAccording to Rohde, the historian and law expert, before Obama took office the 102-year-old act was used just four times against government officials for providing classified information to the media. The Obama administration used it eight times, including against Manning and Edward Snowden, a National Security Agency contractor who leaked information about U.S. telecoms surveillance programs to the press.\n\nSnowden is currently receiving asylum in Russia.\n\nTrump has prosecuted eight government employees for leaking information to the media, according to U.S. Press Freedom Tracker, a press freedom advocacy organization. His administration's use of the act against Assange breaks new legal ground because it is the first time it's been deployed to target a media organization as opposed to a government whistleblower.\n\nYet while the First Amendment protects the publication of truthful information, it does so only if this information is acquired legally.\n\nThe Department of Justice alleges that Assange explicitly solicited – encouraged – Manning to break the law by helping her crack a password that gave her higher-level access to classified computer networks.\n\nManning disputes the allegation.\n\nAs does WikiLeaks.\n\nThe Department of Justice's prosecutors are expected to reveal \"forensic\" digital evidence for this allegation when evidence in Assange's extradition hearing is heard in May. Assange's defense team says it, too, has evidence that refutes the allegation.\n\nAccording to a report in the Associated Press from April 2019 the genesis of the Trump administration's dialing up of the rhetoric on Assange can be traced to WikiLeaks' release, in 2017, of thousands of pages of documents revealing details about CIA cyber-espionage tools for breaking into targeted computers, cellphones and consumer electronics. However, there is an alternative explanation for Trump's interest in a case that Rohde said that if successfully prosecuted would have a \"chilling effect\" on First Amendment protections for the press: Trump's disdain for the media.\n\n\"Assange is low-hanging fruit to Trump,\" said Rohde. \"They can go through the whole process, and win or lose, the process will keep the ball in the air and reinforce that he's prosecuting leakers and the media.\"\n\nCarl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, agreed with this assessment.\n\nTrump \"probably believes he can profit politically from pursuing Assange,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. indictment against Assange does not relate to WikiLeaks' 2016 publication of hacked emails belonging to Clinton's presidential campaign, at a preliminary hearing for Assange's extradition case in late February, Edward Fitzgerald, one of his lawyers, nevertheless said there is evidence that Trump, viathen-Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, offered him a pardon if he agreed to say Russia was not involved in leaking the emails. The White House and Rohrabacher deny a pardon was offered.\n\nAs the extradition hearing got underway, Fitzgerald told a British judge the U.S. indictments against Assange were part of the Trump administration's determination to put a journalist's \"head on a pike\" – part of its war on the press.\n\nWikiLeaks intrigue:Trump offered Assange a pardon if he cleared Russia, lawyer says\n\nIf Assange is extradited to the U.S., he will be tried in the same court – the Eastern District of Virginia – as Kiriakou, the CIA analyst, who was also charged under the Espionage Act, but took a lesser plea under the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.\n\n\"It's known as the 'espionage court,'\" said Kiriakou, adding that \"Assange doesn't stand a chance\" in that federal district court because the jury pool tilts toward individuals who are members of the U.S. intelligence community and their families.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department chose not to comment on whether the Eastern District of Virginia would offer an impartial setting for jury selection in any Assange trial. The White House and U.S. State Department chose not to comment on whether the administration was concerned about the impact of Assange's case on the First Amendment.\n\nLewis, who represents the U.S. government in Assange's extradition hearing, has repeatedly reiterated Washington's position that journalism is not an excuse for breaking the law and that the court proceedings in Britain will prove that he did so.\n\nIn a briefing with reporters ahead of Assange's hearing, Kristin Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks' editor-in-chief, described the indictment against Assange as \"propaganda.\"\n\nAnd Jennifer Robinson, a member of Assange's legal team, said he did \"what all journalists, all honorable ones,\" do every day: take receipt of information, communicate about how to protect the source of that information (Manning), and publish it.\n\n\"What signal does it send to countries like Russia, China\" and other authoritarian governments around the world if this extradition goes ahead, she asked.\n\n'If the law is respected'\n\nStill, it's far from certain that Assange will lose his extradition case. And even if he does, it does not automatically follow he will be sent to the U.S., according to Anand Doobay, an expert in the rules governing extradition at London-based firm Boutique Law.\n\nDoobay said if the judge decides \"not to refuse\" the U.S. request then Britain's secretary of state will have to decide whether to order it, a call that involves scrutiny of factors such as whether there is a risk that by extraditing him Assange could face the death penalty. British law forbids extradition under such circumstances.\n\nWhile none of the current charges carry the death penalty, Assange's supporters have argued that the Trump administration can't be trusted and could decide to unveil additional charges that do carry a death sentence once Assange arrives on U.S. soil.\n\n'Angst, anger':Roger Stone intervention stokes uncertainty across justice system\n\nDoobay noted that most extradition requests the U.S. makes to the U.K. are granted. It's not clear what will happen if Assange prevails in the British court. Because he has already served the 50 weeks for skipping bail he could simply be free to go. But if he is deported to his native Australia, the U.S. could try to mount a new extradition case. It could also issue an international arrest warrant if he travels beyond Britain's borders.\n\nAssange's health will also be considered and Nils Melzer, the United Nations' special rapporteur on torture, said in an interview that when he visited Assange in Belmarsh Prison in May last year he was displaying symptoms akin to \"psychological torture\" likely caused by prolonged exposure to extreme stress, chronic anxiety and isolation.\n\n\"He was very agitated,\" he said. \"Not the normal stress you would see in a prisoner.\"\n\nIn a series of preliminary hearings Assange has attended in person and by video link from prison he has sometimes appeared frail and confused when questioned by the judge. He has also lost weight. However, appearing in court for the extradition hearing in late February he mostly looked relaxed and appeared able to follow along with the proceedings. Although he complained several times that he was struggling to hear the legal arguments being made by both sides because of being forced to sit behind a high glass barrier in the courtroom, a scenario he said that has also prevented him from giving \"confidential instructions\" to his lawyers.\n\n\"I'm as much a participant in the court as a spectator at Wimbledon,\" he told the court at one point, referring to the British tennis tournament. \"This case already has enough spying on my lawyers as it is,\" he added, an apparent reference to his claims that he was surveilled during his time in Ecuador's embassy.\n\nAssange's legal team asked the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, to consider whether he can sit in the well of court, next to them, when evidence in the case is heard in May.\n\nShe said she saw no reason to change the seating arrangement.\n\nWikiLeaks' Hrafnsson said Assange's health has been improving but his father, John Shipton, told reporters ahead of the hearing that his son's long confinement has damaged his health and he feared any U.S. extradition would be akin to a \"death sentence.\"\n\n\"His situation is dire, he has had nine years of ceaseless psychological torture where false accusations are constantly being made,\" said Shipton.\n\nRecently, more than 60 doctors wrote an open letter to Britain's secretary of state saying they fear Assange's health is so bad he could die inside Belmarsh Prison, while 130 prominent figures from the worlds of art, politics and the media in Germany urged authorities to release Assange from detention because of his \"critical health.\"\n\n\"If the law is respected, then I don't see any way for him to be lawfully extradited to the U.S.,\" said Melzer, the U.N.'s envoy on torture, noting that there is a \"political offenses exclusion\" in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. and that \"espionage really is the quintessential political offense.\"\n\nMelzer added that while governments often prosecute leakers and whistleblowers, government employees who actually implement official policy that involves the perpetration of crimes, such as systematic torture, generally enjoy complete impunity.\n\nInstead, he said, with Assange, \"we're sanctioning\" those that disclose this information.\n\n\"That can't be right,\" he added.\n\nAt the hearing, the prosecution has argued that Assange should not be able to rely on the \"political offenses\" exemption in Britain's extradition treaty with the U.S. partly because in publishing the information he did Assange was not expressly trying to overthrow or a cause a change in the U.S. government or its foreign policy.\n\nFitzgerald, for the defense, described this argument as \"absurd.\"\n\n\"What other reason would Mr. Assange have for publishing this information if it wasn't to cause a change in U.S. policy\" in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere, he said.\n\nSteve Bannon testifies:Trump saw Roger Stone as 'access point' to WikiLeaks\n\nMelzer, who is an academic and a lawyer, also expressed concern over the allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Assange that date from 2010. Sweden's authorities ended their investigations without charging Assange in November due to what they characterized as weakened evidence. Melzer said the police reports are riddled with contradictions and possibly even exculpatory evidence, such as text messages that indicate one of the claimants didn't want to accuse Assange of anything and that it was the police who \"made up the charges.\" This claimant was only concerned about getting Assange to take an HIV test because they had unprotected sex.\n\nMelzer said he has written multiple letters to the Swedish authorities asking for clarifications over inconsistencies in internal police correspondence but the response from the Swedish government has been: \"We have no further observations.\"\n\nIn one letter Melzer wrote to Sweden's minister of foreign affairs in May last year he says Assange has effectively been \"publicly shamed\" and \"defamed.\"\n\nThe Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement to USA TODAY that its case against Assange is closed and it does not want to comment on Melzer's allegations.\n\nThe Swedish allegations may appear tangential to Assange's case, but they are in fact a central plank in the circumstances that have directly led to his current plight: It's unlikely Assange would have fled to the embassy without Sweden's original claims.\n\nAssange 'told the truth'\n\nGeoffrey Robertson, a human rights lawyer who previously represented Assange – Robinson, from Assange's defense team, works in the firm he founded, Doughty Street Chambers – said that there was \"no doubt\" that the Trump administration was prepared to pursue Assange \"to the ends of the Earth\" because it is \"determined to create precedents that will shackle investigative journalism\" and prevent it from airing the U.S.'s secrets.\n\n\"This is about deterrence,\" he said.\n\nStill, Robertson added that \"America is a beacon of free speech\" and the First Amendment is a \"phenomenal example to the world\" at a time when all over the planet autocratic governments are trying to jail journalists or \"shut them up.\"\n\nIt would be a shame, he said, if the U.S. \"abandons its principles when we need them.\"\n\nRobertson, who like Assange was born in Australia, has won landmark rulings on civil liberties from the highest courts in Britain, Europe and elsewhere. He has been a United Nations war crimes judge and defended scores of people facing death sentences.\n\n\"What the U.S. wants to do with Julian Assange – let him die in jail, essentially – is completely disproportionate to what he has done: told the truth. And no one has disputed that what Julian Assange did was anything but tell the truth,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/05/07/unemployment-coronavirus-trump-ahmaud-arbery-iran-thursdays-news/5175674002/", "title": "Unemployment, coronavirus, Trump, Ahmaud Arbery, Iran ...", "text": "New details emerge in the slaying of a Georgia jogger.

The father and son were both charged with murder and aggravated assault, GBI said in a statement.\n\nAttorneys for Arbery's family previously expressed he was the victim of racial profiling after he was chased down while jogging and shot in Georgia as the killing was recorded on video. Gregory McMichael, a former police officer, and his adult son Travis, both white men, were captured on video killing Arbery, which was taken by Travis' neighbor, a third white man. The three men were in \"hot pursuit\" of Arbery, according to a memo obtained by USA TODAY, written by the district attorney who previously led the investigation into Arbery's death. The attorney initially told police that he did not see grounds for an arrest of the men, according to the memo.\n\nBrace for a historic unemployment rate\n\nMillions more Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as the nation braces for a likely historic unemployment rate. Almost 3.2 million Americans filed new jobless claims last week, pushing the total to an astonishing 33 million in less than two months as the coronavirus crisis continues to hammer the U.S economy. The tally signals what is almost certain to be the worst unemployment rate ever seen when the government reports that figure Friday.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 1st of September 2023. Today, Supreme Court disclosures as the conversation around ethics reform rolls on. Plus, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been cleared to continue with his schedule, and a blood cancer is no longer considered a death sentence.\n\n♦\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas yesterday disclosed more travel paid for by GOP megadonor, Harlan Crow, last year. The disclosure comes amid pressure for ethics reform on the high court. I spoke with USA TODAY Supreme Court Correspondent John Fritze for the latest. Hey there, John.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nHi.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo John, what did Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas disclose yesterday?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThomas filed his annual disclosure report. He actually filed it a few weeks back and it was made public just now. And there were a few trips on there that were paid for by Harlan Crow, who's the GOP megadonor who's been at the center of all the controversy with Thomas. These three trips, two to Texas for conferences, were paid for by Crow and involved private jet travel, and a third trip to Crow's lodge in the Adirondacks.\n\nIn some ways, the trips themselves are of course interesting, although they are part and parcel with what we've seen in some of the past reporting around this travel that's been paid for by Crow. What might be more interesting is some of the efforts that Thomas made to explain it. In particular, I think, there's been a lot of focus in the fact that Thomas seems to justify one of these trips to Texas, the use of a private jet, by saying that, \"Well, look. There was heightened security involved after the major abortion decision leaked last year. There was a lot of anger about that.\" People were showing up at the Justice's house to protest. And so Thomas seems to be suggesting that based on that, he felt it was a wiser course to take this private jet trip paid for by Harlan Crow than to fly commercial or some other way. And then in another instance, he talks about an unexpected ice storm that he said required him to take the private jet back to the Washington area from Texas, after speaking to a group in Texas in February.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd John, what did his attorney say about so-called weaponized ethics allegations?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nI think the first thing, just to back up for a second, his attorney - the fact that a Supreme Court justice has an attorney and is speaking out like this is pretty unusual and should be noted. I don't think I've ever seen it before. And what we have as a multipage statement from this attorney who's representing Thomas, arguing that the criticism is political. That these complaints that have been raised against him and this news coverage that has been raising questions about some of this travel is politically motivated, and based on Thomas's ideology as a conservative.\n\nI think it's worth just pausing there for a second and noting that Thomas has amended his report here and he, in his own words, is acknowledging omissions, which he says were inadvertent. But the fact that he has changed these disclosures and he's got a couple of pages of explanation here on this report, that's pretty unusual. And I think it at least demonstrates that there were some problems with his earlier disclosure reports.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Justice Samuel Alito also filed his disclosure report. What did we learn in his filing?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nFar more perfunctory, I think is the word I used in the story. Alito's report is more like what we expect to see from these reports. Some travel paid for by law schools. In particular, I think the most notable one was a Notre Dame trip in Rome. This is a trip, by the way, that everybody knew about a little after the fact. But we did eventually find out about this trip and that Justice Alito gave an address in Rome. It was newsworthy because he was pushing back on criticism of the abortion decision, which he was the author of. And so the fact that Notre Dame paid for this trip is not a huge surprise.\n\nThe difference with Thomas is that a lot of these trips are not official. They involve vacations and in other instances, we didn't really know about these trips beforehand, let alone who was paying for them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJohn, you were on earlier this week talking about how this idea of ethics reform on the high court appears to have stalled. Will these disclosures have any effect on getting the ball rolling again?\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nI think I was skeptical that these disclosure reports on their own would prompt a new discussion. I'm not so sure now. I think that first of all, there's an awful lot of explanation here. I think reporters such as myself are going to be looking into a lot of these allegations that are leveled, both in Thomas's statement and in the lawyer statement, looking into a lot of the factual positions taken. And so it could lead to additional reporting and it could lead to additional questions.\n\nI think as has happened with ethical issues on the court for some time now, folks on the left are going to say that this is not satisfactory and doesn't really solve anything. And folks on the right are going to say that Thomas did nothing wrong. And so I don't know that this changes the dynamic for Congress, but it could at least raise the scrutiny level or keep the pressure on in some ways for those of us looking into these trips and these outside entanglements with the justices.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nJohn Fritze, always great insight for us from the Supreme Court. Thank you, John.\n\nJohn Fritze:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell's doctor cleared him yesterday to continue working with his schedule. Dr. Brian P. Monahan wrote in a note that the 81-year-old senator has experienced occasional lightheadedness from dehydration and a previous concussion. He wrote the note after McConnell froze on Wednesday at a press conference in Kentucky. It was the second time in several weeks that he had to pause taking questions at a press conference and receive assistance from aides. President Joe Biden said yesterday that he spoke with McConnell by phone and that the Republican leader was again, his old self.\n\n♦\n\nProud Boys member Joseph Biggs was sentenced yesterday to 17 years in prison for his role in the seditious conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election and keep Donald Trump in the White House. It's the second longest sentence yet related to January 6th, 2021, but it's less than the 33 years prosecutors had proposed. Biggs helped lead Proud Boys at the Capitol, made it inside to the Senate chamber and posted on social media that the riot was a warning shot to the government, according to a sentencing memo from prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said he aimed for the sentence to deter future violence and protect the public from another attack like January 6th. He also sentenced another Proud Boys leader yesterday, Zachary Rehl, to 15 years in prison after he was also convicted of seditious conspiracy. Members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups were convicted of being leaders of the insurrection when thousands of rioters fought police outside the Capitol and then rampaged through the building.\n\n♦\n\nThe blood cancer multiple myeloma was once considered a death sentence. But thanks to major advancements in recent years, it's now highly treatable. I spoke with USA TODAY Health Reporter Karen Weintraub for more. Howdy Karen.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nHello.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo starting here, for folks who may not know, what is multiple myeloma?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo it's a type of cancer of the plasma cell. Plasma is part of the blood and it's involved in immune functions. So when you get cancer, it can crowd out the healthy cells and wreak havoc.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd what advances are we seeing in how this disease is treated?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nIt has always been considered a fatal disease. Well, it has been transformed in many cases into a chronic disease, into something you can live with for a long time. And the hope is that it will soon be a curable disease. Basically, there are now so many different types of treatments that people can go from one to the next to the next and live for many years. One doctor was telling me that for a 75-year-old, he can keep them going long enough that they will have a normal lifespan and probably die of something else. For somebody who's younger, again, he can keep them going long enough that hopefully a cure will come within their lifetime. And it may be that one of the drugs or a combination of the drugs that we have at this point will be a cure for many or most people. But we just haven't figured out the exact sequencing of those treatments yet to bring that about.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I mean, what's some of the science behind these advances that we're seeing?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nIt's a combination of things. Some of the therapies are understanding the molecular activity, what genes got messed up in these cancers, or what's going on at the level of the tumor. Some of them are what's going on at the level of the immune system and helping amp up the immune system to fight off the cancer. And then again, as some combination seems to be effective as well.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma. announced this week. What's his prognosis and will these new treatments help him?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo obviously everybody's course is different. I can't predict what will happen to him, but again, this is not a death sentence anymore. It certainly was 15, 20 years ago. Now there's a possibility that he could live out a normal lifespan, certainly one hopes that he will.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Karen, this really feels like a success story. What lessons can be taken to help advance other cancer treatments?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah, so there's maybe not direct lessons in the sense of the same treatments might not exactly work for other cancers. The immune therapies that were invented for leukemia and lymphoma are the same ones that are being used, slightly different targets, for multiple myeloma. So the learnings have gone from one blood cancer to another. This sequence of events here is what's happening actually in a number of cancers and will hopefully happen in a lot more, which is coming up with enough treatments to keep people alive, to turn diseases into chronic rather than acute problems, crises. Keep people alive long enough and sequence treatments enough, improve the quality of those years, the years that people do get, and then eventually, hopefully these combinations and treatments will become a cure.\n\nOne other key point, I think, is that not all of these treatments are available to everybody. A lot more people could be effectively treated if they had access to these treatments. Some of them are very expensive. Some of them just require a lot of expertise and specialization that may not be available to people, say in rural areas or people without good insurance. And so it's very important for patients to get access to specialists, and for these drugs to be made available to people who may not have the financial resources.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren Weintraub covers health for USA TODAY. Thanks Karen.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAfter a heavy week of news, we wanted to ring in this Labor Day weekend with a brighter story. So let's go to Michigan and the story of a dog who found a home.\n\nHe'd had enough of being at the animal shelter, so Scout the dog climbed over a fence, then another, crossed a busy highway, and ended up on the couch inside of a nursing home. A nurse there found him, called the shelter just down the road, and they discovered that Scout had escaped. The sheriff then came and returned him to the shelter. But a few nights later, on that same couch in the nursing home lobby, there was Scout. He'd somehow again scaled a 10-foot chain link fence, then another six-foot fence, and finally that same scary highway without getting run over, all to find the same couch as before, to make himself at home for the night. A call was made, and he went back to the shelter. When it happened a third time, the nursing home had a decision to make, and they adopted him.\n\nNowadays, Scout has free rein at Glacier Hill, the nursing home where he kept showing up, and delights the 20 or so seniors who live there. He even knows how to get into their rooms by jumping up and using his paw to pull down door handles. And he knows which residents keep dog biscuits in their walkers for him. Earlier this year, the nurses held a fundraiser in Scout's honor. They raised money for the shelter that brought Scout in off the street and later to them. You can read more of Scout's story with a link in today's show notes.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. We're produced by Shannon Rae Green, and our executive producer is Laura Beatty.

New feature boosts parental ...", "text": "Instagram has officially launched its new Teen Accounts feature, marking one of Meta's biggest efforts to date to bolster safety for its youngest users online.\n\nThe new accounts, automatically assigned to any new users under the age of 18, place limits on what users can see, who can message and interact with them, and enable parents to exercise more control over their teens' social media use.\n\nMeta promised the rollout of additional safety features earlier this year after it came under fire in both the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps are addictive and have fueled a youth mental health crisis.\n\nIn October, more than 40 states filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the social media company profited from the advertising revenue gained by intentionally designing features on Instagram and Facebook to maximize the time teens and children spent on the platforms.\n\nMeta said in a statement at the time that it shares the “commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online,\" adding, “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path.\"\n\nNow, users will start to see some of the promised changes.\n\nWhat is an Instagram Teen Account?\n\nEvery new Instagram user under the age of 18 will automatically be signed up for a Teen Account, which regulates how they view and interact with the app and gives parents specific controls over their teen's experience on the app.\n\nThese accounts come with unique features designed to limit teen activity on the app, including messaging and inappropriate content restrictions, automatic private accounts and time limits set by parents.\n\nThe accounts can be changed to have less strict settings, but teens under 16 will need their parent's permission to make this change.\n\n\"We know parents want to feel confident that their teens can use social media to connect with their friends and explore their interests, without having to worry about unsafe or inappropriate experiences,\" Instagram said in a press release. \"This new experience is designed to better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place.\"\n\nThe content that's viewable via the Teen Account is filtered by the most stringent settings, hiding content classified as \"sensitive\" even when shared by someone they follow. The accounts also notify the app not to suggest anything marked as potentially sensitive to these accounts in the first place. This applies not only to traditional posts but Reels and suggested accounts as well.\n\nSensitive posts can include things like sexually suggestive content, content discussing suicide, self-harm or disordered eating, images of violence including fights caught on camera and posts discussing plastic surgery procedures.\n\nTeens will also get access to a new Explore feature that allows them to select topics they want to see more posts about, allowing them to further tailor what comes across their pages.\n\nMessaging is also restricted by default on Teen Accounts, meaning they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to. Teen Accounts can also only be tagged or mentioned by people they follow and come equipped with Instagram's tightest anti-bullying settings, meaning offensive words and phrases will be filtered out of comments and DM requests.\n\nHow will Instagram enforce Teen Accounts?\n\nInstagram also has plans to enforce these age restrictions even when teens attempt to circumvent them by lying about their birth dates or attempting to gain parental control over each other's accounts.\n\nAccount creators will be asked to verify their age using ID, and additional verification steps will be added. Since 2022, teens have been required to prove their age with a video selfie or ID check if they attempt to change their birthday from under the age of 18 to over 18. If a teen attempts to update their birthday from a younger age to an older age, the platform requires proof of age with an ID check.\n\nFurther steps will include using information about a teen’s original account to prevent them from using a new account with an adult age or preventing teens from linking their accounts to accounts with adult ages.\n\nLikewise, Instagram is working on an AI model that can detect if someone is likely to be underage even if they put an adult birthday in at the account signup. By using clues like a review of the accounts and types of content an account is interacting with, the AI tech, which has yet to be rolled out, may automatically switch an account over to a teen version, though account holders will be able to change this setting.\n\nParental control features\n\nParental controls are a major part of the new Teen Accounts, as Instagram said its inspiration for the new features came from feedback on parents' most common concerns.\n\nParents can set up parental supervision on their teens' accounts, which enables them to approve and deny their teens’ requests to change settings or allow teens to manage their settings themselves and gives parents access to optional monitoring tools.\n\nUsing these tools, parents can see the topics their teens are looking at and get a look at who they are chatting with. While parents can't read their children's messages or see which posts they view directly, they can see who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and what topics they have opted to see more of on their feeds.\n\nA few more of these parental tools allow users to limit the amount of time spent on Instagram. Some of these include:\n\nTime limit reminders : Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day.\n\n: Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day. Sleep mode enabled : Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs.\n\n: Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs. Set total daily time limits for teens’ Instagram usage: Parents can decide how much time their teen can spend on Instagram each day. Once a teen hits that limit, they’ll no longer be able to access the app.\n\nHow to get an Instagram Teen Account\n\nInstagram began placing all teens under 18 who sign up for a new account on Teen Accounts starting Tuesday, but existing accounts belonging to teenagers will not automatically transfer quite yet.\n\nAccording to the company, Instagram plans to move existing accounts owned by teenagers over to Teen Accounts within the next 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and elsewhere starting in January.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/02/boy-mom-social-media-term-explained/72808069007/", "title": "'Boy mom' term explained: What it means and why it's cringey", "text": "Do you know a \"boy mom?\" Are you a \"boy mom?\" Before you answer, you might want to make sure you're caught up on the most recent internet slang.\n\nA recent TikTok post by a momfluencer has been circulating through the platform in the past week, drawing criticism and reigniting the conversation around \"boy moms.\"\n\nThe since-deleted video featured a content creator who often shares videos of and centered around her children discussing the difference between her feelings for her young daughter and son. In it, she says that though she is \"obsessed\" with and loves her daughter, her son \"has her heart and soul\" because her \"whole life, she wanted to be a boy mom\" and that her fellow \"boy moms\" will understand what she's saying.\n\nOther TikTok users were quick to respond, saying the post was inappropriate and could be hurtful to her daughter if she ever stumbled across it, as it appears to make clear that one child is a favorite based upon their gender.\n\nWhile it has stirred up its fair share of controversy, the video is far from the first and certainly won't be the last to draw out debates surrounding parenting, gender and so-called \"boy moms.\"\n\nSo what is a boy mom if not simply a mother of boys? Read more about the internet colloquialism here.\n\n'Who TF Did I Marry':Woman's TikTok saga on marriage to ex-husband goes massively viral\n\nWhat is a 'boy mom'?\n\nA \"boy mom\" is something of a negative character archetype oft-recognized on the internet. The term itself is slang to refer to a specific kind of parent who is perceived as being overly fixated on their male children, often to the detriment of other female children or people in their lives.\n\nA mother may be called a \"boy mom\" if she talks about or displays signs of favoring her male children over her female children, expresses a distaste for girl children and enthusiasm for boys based solely on gender, speaks about her son in a way that viewers perceive as being almost romantic, hyper-fixates on her male child's gender and all things \"boy,\" or if she gives special treatment to her sons through coddling and obvious favoritism.\n\nAs the internet will quickly tell you, every mom who happens to have male children is not a \"boy mom.\" A mom of boys is a neutral identifier while a certified \"Boy Mom\" is a mom who displays certain kinds of behaviors or subscribes to certain ideals.\n\nWhile the term has become popular across social media platforms, it is most often discussed on TikTok, where people often make skits and parodies pantomiming the stereotypical caricature of a \"boy mom.\"\n\nThese often cover themes like moms being over-protective and coddling their sons, deciding they can do no wrong even when they're grown adults; moms who treat their sons like their romantic partners, acting as if they're in competition with daughters-in-law and future dates or referring to their sons growing up and leaving home as a \"break-up\"; moms sharing how they don't love their girl children as much as their boys; and moms who center their lives around being a mom to a boy, often to the point of annoying others in everyday conversation.\n\nOften, conversations about \"boy moms\" center around implications of emotional incest, misogyny and misplaced emotional attachment.\n\nWhat does 'oomf' mean:Add the indirect term to your digital vocab\n\nWhere did the slang term 'boy mom' come from?\n\nThe term \"boy mom\" was originally not a negative one, Like \"girl dad,\" it was used by parents to refer to the experience of having a child of a different gender from their own.\n\nIn the past, it was used simply by certain moms who had boy children. Often, it was used to describe experiences they felt were unique to having boys, like incidences of roughhousing, toilet issues, or shopping for toys and clothes traditionally marketed toward boys. It was also used by moms of boys simply to express their enjoyment of being a mother to male children.\n\nOver time, however, both the terms \"boy mom\" and \"girl dad\" took on an ironic meaning. The types of content posted by self-identified \"boy moms\" began to share some common themes and tropes, and viral videos that were received poorly by the internet began to surface and be parodied.\n\nAs the conversation around parenting and traditional ideas of gender evolved, so did the ideas of these parents who became unduly fixated on or \"obsessed\" with their children's gender. Eventually, netizens came to associate a certain kind of content and certain kind of behavior with \"boy moms.\" The term soon began synonymous with \"cringy\" or embarrassing behavior online.\n\nNow, plenty of people still use the term positively, proudly referring to themselves as a \"boy mom.\" Others have come to use the term ironically, as a joke, or even as an insult, depending on where you stumble across it.\n\nWant to learn?

The announcement comes as the company faces mounting pressure from regulators who claim its social media sites are addictive and harmful to the mental health of younger users.\n\nIn a blog post, Meta said the measures, which will roll out in the coming weeks, are designed “to give teens more age-appropriate experiences on our apps.\" The protections will make it more difficult for teens to view and search for sensitive content such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, according to Meta.\n\nHere's what to know about the changes:\n\nMeta faces federal lawsuit related to young users\n\nMeta has come under fire in recent months in both the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps are addictive and have fueled a youth mental health crisis.\n\nIn October, more than 40 states filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the social media company profited from the advertising revenue gained by intentionally designing features on Instagram and Facebook to maximize the time teens and children spent on the platforms.\n\nComing after a two-year multistate investigation, the lawsuit cited several studies – including Meta's own research – showing links between young people's use of Instagram and Facebook with depression, anxiety and other health problems. Attorneys claimed in the lawsuit that the sites' algorithms trigger releases of the pleasure chemical dopamine in young users that encourages them to continue scrolling, \"much like a gambler at a slot machine.\"\n\nMeta said in a statement at the time that it shares the “commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online.\"\n\n“We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,” the company said.\n\nMeta to update teen privacy settings, hide search terms\n\nMeta's new policy means that the profile of all users under 18 will soon default to the most restrictive settings.\n\nFor those accounts, certain types of content will be hidden on both Facebook and Instagram – even if shared by someone a teen follows – and certain search terms will be restricted. If a teen searchers for a restricted term related to suicide, self-harm or eating disorders, they will instead be directed toward “expert resources for help” like the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Meta said.\n\nWhile Meta will automatically set all teen accounts to the most stringent settings, the company acknowledged that these settings can be changed by users.\n\nTeen users will also be prompted to update their privacy settings themselves, the company said.\n\nFor those who turn on recommended privacy settings, Meta will automatically limit who can repost their content, tag or mention them, or include their content in Reels and remixes. Under these settings, only a user's followers can send messages and offensive comments will not be visible at all.\n\nMeta says it regularly consults experts on platform safety\n\nMeta's blog post did not specifically mention the legal action it faces, but the company said it regularly consults “with experts in adolescent development, psychology and mental health to help make our platforms safe.\"\n\n\"We’ve spent over a decade developing policies and technology to address content that breaks our rules or could be seen as sensitive,\" the company said.\n\nIn a statement, Rachel Rodgers, a psychologist at Northeastern University, called the measures \"an important step in making social media platforms spaces where teens can connect and be creative in age-appropriate ways.\"\n\n\"These policies reflect current understandings and expert guidance regarding teen’s safety and well-being,\" Rodgers said. \"As these changes unfold, they provide good opportunities for parents to talk with their teens about how to navigate difficult topics.”\n\nContributing: Mike Snider\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The gravity of the situation cannot be emphasized enough; it had the potential to lead to serious consequences,\" police in the Chicago suburb of Gurnee said in a statement on Facebook.\n\nMichigan: In Michigan, the Cheboygan County Sheriff’s Department and Cheboygan City Police Department issued a joint press release warning residents about the trend.\n\nInstances of students playing the game have resulted in disturbances, such as a student breaking into another student’s home to “tag” them with a paintball gun or a group of students wearing ski masks entering a restaurant to find their opponents and being confronted by a licensed concealed pistol holder, the Cheboygan Daily Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network, writes.

In the crowd stood Todd Minor, father to 12-year-old Matthew Minor, who lost his life after being exposed to a video on TikTok of a \"choking challenging\" trend, which falsely claimed \"kids can safely choke themselves,\" Todd Minor shared with USA TODAY.\n\n\"Congress must hold these companies accountable for the lives they have ended and destroyed,\" Minor said at the hearing.\n\nContributing: Jillian Fellows of the Cheboygan Daily Tribune and Angel Albring of the York Daily Record", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/01"}]}

The Nickelodeon 'golden boy' accused of ...", "text": "Buzz has continued to swirl around several big names in Hollywood since the premiere of the Investigation Discovery docuseries \"Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV\" early this week.\n\nReleased in two parts on Sunday and Monday evening, the tell-all documentary shocked viewers with behind-the-scenes stories of some of Nickelodeon's biggest television shows, revealing the allegedly toxic and abusive environment that was cultivated behind the scenes by adults at the network, including Brian Peck, who served jail time for his sexual abuse of teen star Drake Bell.\n\nShowrunner Dan Schneider was one of the primary focuses of the documentary, as both former child stars and adult coworkers recounted tales of alleged racism, sexism, harassment and verbal abuse at his hands. Described as Nickelodeon's \"golden boy,\" Schnieder was behind some of the most successful live-action shows in the network's history, a level of success that some of his former coworkers say enabled his bad behavior.\n\nWhat allegedly happened behind the scenes of some of Nick's most beloved shows and how was Schneider involved? Here's what we know.\n\nWho is Brian Peck:Ex-Nickelodeon coach convicted of lewd acts with minor back in spotlight\n\nWho is Dan Schneider?\n\nDan Schneider is a television producer, screenwriter and actor best known for his work in children's television.\n\nSchneider and his production company, Schneider's Bakery, are behind some of Nickelodeon's most well-known shows, including \"The Amanda Show,\" \"Drake & Josh,\" \"Zoe 101,\" \"iCarly,\" and others.\n\nSchneider dabbled in acting early in his career, landing a few small roles and a recurring spot on the 1980s sitcom \"Head of the Class\" as Dennis Blunden.\n\nHe began working as a writer and producer for Nickelodeon in the 1990s and continued to work with the network until the two parted ways in 2018.\n\nWhat was Dan Schneider accused of?\n\nAlleged gender discrimination\n\nSchneider was one of the most common subjects of discussion in the documentary, which was inspired by an investigative report by Kate Taylor.\n\nSchneider was accused of engaging in unprofessional and inappropriate behaviors in the workplace, one of the most common of which included frequently asking female employees to massage his neck while on set.\n\n\"The Amanda Show\" writers Jenny Kilgen and Christy Stratton accused Schneider of blatant displays of discriminatory behavior, saying he made them share a salary as the only two women in the writing room and often made inappropriate comments and demands of them. They eventually went on to sue the network for gender-based discrimination.\n\nRacism allegations\n\nTwo former actors on \"All That,\" Bryan Hearne and Giovonnie Samuels, said they experienced racism on set, alleging they were cast in stereotyped roles and treated poorly by the showrunner.\n\n\"Someone said the skin tone should be charcoal. I started to get teary-eyed,\" Hearne recalls in the docuseries while discussing costuming for a skit in which he was assigned to play a rapper named \"Lil' Fetus.\" At another point, his mother pointed out the implications of her son, the only Black male on the cast of the show at the time, being cast to play a character that behaved like a drug dealer.\n\nSchneider's shows of the era frequently featured only one or two Black cast members. In the documentary, he and other writers were accused of tokenizing those characters on his shows.\n\nAlleged inappropriate behavior\n\nAdults who worked behind the scenes at the time, including Kilgen and Stratton, said in the doc that Schnieder had a propensity for incorporating too-adult humor into his kids shows. They said Schneider acknowledged at multiple points that he found incorporating innuendo into his children's programming to be funny.\n\nIt was alleged he pushed for short skirts, bikinis and costuming that some actors found to be not age-appropriate. Scenes ranging from pickles being slid through holes in the wall to Jamie Lynn Spears having a gooey substance shot on her face were shown and subject to scrutiny.\n\nSchneider denies the claims\n\nSchneider denied these claims. In a statement, his spokesperson argued: \"Remember, all stories, dialogue, costumes, and makeup were fully approved by network executives on two coasts. A standards and practices group read and ultimately approved every script, and programming executives reviewed and approved all episodes. In addition, every day on every set, there were always parents and caregivers and their friends watching filming and rehearsals.”\n\nSchneider was also accused of verbal and emotional abuse in the form of screaming, yelling, threats, insults and other \"toxic\" behaviors. He has not been accused of any form of physical abuse, sexual or otherwise.\n\nChild stars speak out:Nickelodeon actors allege abuse in 'Quiet on Set' doc: These former child stars have spoken up\n\nWhat shows did Dan Schneider work on?\n\nSchneider worked in the entertainment industry from the '80s until 2018, wracking up a long list of credits along the way. However, he is best known for his work in family and children's television, especially with Nickelodeon.\n\nSome of his most popular shows include:\n\n\"Good Burger\"\n\n\"Kenan & Kel\"\n\n\"All That\"\n\n\"The Amanda Show\"\n\n\"What I Like About You\"\n\n\"iCarly\"\n\n\"Drake & Josh\"\n\n\"Zoey 101\"\n\n\"Victorious\"\n\n\"Sam & Cat\"\n\n\"Henry Danger\"\n\n\"Game Shakers\"\n\nWhat has Dan Schneider said about 'Quiet on Set?'\n\nSchneider responds:Dan Schneider addresses allegations of a toxic workplace on his Nickelodeon TV shows\n\nIn a statement previously given to USA TODAY, a representative for Schneider said, in part:\n\n\"Everything that happened on the shows Dan ran was carefully scrutinized by dozens of involved adults, and approved by the network. Had there been any scenes or outfits that were inappropriate in any way, they would have been flagged and blocked by this multilayered scrutiny.\"\n\nAnother part of the statement read, \"In a career spanning 30+ years, Dan worked with thousands of people, many of whom still tell him how much they enjoyed and appreciated working on his shows. But he also knows some people did not have a positive experience, and he is truly sorry for that. Dan knows he should have done better and feels awful about anyone who saw him at his worst, instead of his best.\"\n\nSchneider also posted a video response to his YouTube channel on Tuesday following the release of \"Quiet on Set.\" In it, he speaks to BooG!e, the actor who played T-Bo on iCarly.\n\n\"The main thing that I would change is how I treat people and everyone. I definitely at times didn’t give people the best of me. I didn’t show enough patience. I could be cocky and definitely overambitious and sometimes just straight-up rude and obnoxious, and I am so sorry that I ever was,\" Schneider said.\n\nHow to watch 'Quiet on Set'\n\n\"Quiet On Set: The Dark Side Of Kids TV\" premiered on Investigation Discovery (ID) on Sunday, March 17 at 9 p.m. ET. The four-episode series aired in two parts, the second of which was released the following day on Monday, March 18, also at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nThe ID channel is available through some cable subscriptions and via live TV streaming services including Fubo, DirecTV, Philo and Sling.\n\nIt will also be available to stream after its release on Max, Prime Video, Apple TV, and The Roku Channel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html", "title": "The dark side of Discord for teens | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen a mother in Washington state learned her teenage daughter was on Discord, a popular social media platform, she felt reasonably comfortable with the idea of her using it to communicate with members of her high school marching band.\n\nBut in September, the mother discovered the 16-year-old was also using the audio and chat service to message with someone who appeared from his profile picture to be an older man. The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like otherparents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.) The mother received an automated email from its Trust and Security team.\n\n“We’re sorry to hear that you came across this type of content, and we understand that this can be extremely concerning,” said the Discord response, reviewed by CNN Business. “Unfortunately, we’re unable to locate the content with the information you’ve provided. We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/07/01/tennessees-elvis-act-goes-into-effect-on-july-1-heres-what-well-see-next/73264010007/", "title": "As Tennessee's ELVIS Act goes into effect, the music industry ...", "text": "Tennessee's ELVIS Act goes into effect on Monday, ushering in a new era of legal ramifications for those who abuse AI in their music-making process as the public questions what will come next.\n\nThe act, which is short for The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, passed on March 21 when Gov.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history,” President Abraham Lincoln wrote in his 1862 message to legislators as the Civil War raged. “We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves … The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.”\n\nLincoln’s words stand out on Presidents Day weekend, when history is being made from Beijing to Ukraine to the US. It’s true, as L.P. Hartley wrote, that “the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.” But we visit that foreign country all the time.\n\nThe uses and misuses of history are at the root of so many struggles playing out in American society and politics right now.\n\nA year ago in January, the San Francisco Unified School District voted to rename 44 schools, eliminating ones memorializing Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Paul Revere and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, for a variety of reasons. The school board reversed itself in April after criticism from parents, the mayor and the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nThe debacle was only one of the factors behind last week’s recall election that bounced three school board members from their seats. Also at play, Nicole Hemmer wrote, were “extended pandemic school closures … an attempt to move away from testing and GPA requirements for admission into high-ranking public schools, a growing achievement gap, an enormous budget deficit and, in the case of one school board member, the use of a racial slur in an anti-Asian rant…”\n\n“Deep-pocketed, right-leaning donors shoveled money into the recall, while activists and media outlets began using language that lashed together the disparate dissatisfactions into a coherent message,” observed Hemmer. “Democratic politicians often lack courage when backlash politics are in motion, as likely to jump on the outrage bandwagon as shrink into the shadows, waiting for it to blow over. But they and progressive activists have a responsibility to counter moral panics with narratives more rooted in reality and more concerned with those whose needs are being overlooked.”\n\nIn the Los Angeles Times, Mark Z. Barabak called Tuesday’s recall “a foreshock, a warning – as if Democrats needed any more of those – that November’s midterm elections could be very bad indeed, as parents unsettled by two years of pandemic-related upheaval vent their frustrations at the polls.”\n\nBill Bramhall/New York Daily News\n\nThe recall was “a landslide,” wrote Henry Olsen in the Washington Post. “Between 72 and 79 percent of San Franciscans who voted opted to kick them out. Every region in the city voted against the three board members, including more than 80 percent in heavily Asian districts such as Chinatown, Richmond and Sunset. No one can credibly say this was a case of Republicans using imaginary issues to fan voter discontent.”\n\nIn June, San Francisco voters will choose whether to recall another official – District Attorney Chesa Boudin. As Jill Filipovic wrote, this week “Boudin came forward with a stunning claim: That the San Francisco Police Department’s crime lab uses DNA evidence obtained from rape kits and entered into a DNA database to try to identify suspects in other crimes … Whatever is ultimately determined about the police department’s lab, the damage may already be done. If rape survivors believe that the evidence collected in their rape kits could be used against them, that’s one more reason on an already-long list to not trust the criminal justice system – or seek justice at all.”\n\nSchool wars\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\nRon Brownstein wrote for CNN Politics that “the pressures of the coronavirus pandemic are reconfiguring the politics of education, dividing Democrats and creating new openings for Republicans.” The key factor, he observed, is “an aggressive drive by Republicans to censor how public school teachers talk about race, gender, sexual orientation and other sensitive topics. That effort amounts to the most intrusive attempt to set legislative limits on the specific content of classroom instruction since the spate of state laws barring the teaching of evolution during the 1920s and the anti-Communist loyalty oaths for teachers that proliferated during the Joe McCarthy era after World War II.”\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nReflecting on Black History Month, Danté Stewart noted, “There are those who seem to think our lives are just lessons, somehow reducing us to helping White people to ‘get it.’ My mind cannot escape the simple fact that so many people ran to our books and our art or to the streets in 2020, believing that simply reading or marching would somehow magically change the White supremacist power structure so pervasive in our country without fundamental change in how we live together.”\n\n“Just two years later, after all the anti-racist work and organizing, we are dealing once again with White backlash on one hand, and White exhaustion on the other. Some want to erase us. Others want to control us. This misses the power of our living. We neither must be perfect or in performance to stay alive. We neither must be ‘exceptional’ or ‘superhuman.’ None of that is necessary. The power is that we are here…”\n\nComplicating the picture for Democrats in the midterm elections, Justin Gest wrote, is their growing fear that a substantial number of Latino voters are open to supporting Republicans. “Contrary to their monolithic treatment by many Americans, Latinos have always been very diverse – economically, culturally and in their ethnic and national origins. But, politically speaking, they were reliably Democratic.”\n\n“That may no longer be true. In an era when conservative politics is acutely nationalist and consumed by a sense of cultural threat, a number of new polls show Latino voters growing more Republican.”\n\nVoters this year will make fateful choices about the future of American elections, according to the officials who manage the voting process in two states. California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber and Jocelyn Benson, who holds the equivalent post in Michigan, wrote, “there are already nearly two dozen candidates running to be the chief election officer in their state who question the legitimacy of President Biden’s win in 2020 and support efforts to both restrict access to the ballot and institute changes that would allow officials to invalidate or overturn results at will.”\n\n“One has called for the dissolution of the bipartisan Wisconsin Election Commission, which fairly administers elections in the Badger State; another proposed a bill in the Arizona state legislature that would allow that partisan body to simply overrule a secretary of state’s decision to officially certify the results of an election.”\n\nHealing a divided nation is a huge challenge. In his new book on Lincoln’s plans for peace after the Civil War, John Avlon writes that the 16th president’s second inaugural address in 1865 cast him as “a prophet of reconciliation” who urged his nation “to transcend all the dualities that divided it: North and South, black and white, free and unfree – carrying forward recognition of our common humanity into the wider world…so that the promise of the United States might be redeemed and serve as a beacon of universal freedom.”\n\nUkraine stakes\n\nDavid Horsey/Seattle Times\n\nNo one outside the Kremlin knows what Vladimir Putin will do with the enormous military force assembled on the borders of Ukraine. “This is probably the largest accretion of firepower seen in Europe for 40 years,” The Economist has reported. “Russia has activated units from every corner of its territory. Even the Eastern Military District, an administrative zone that stretches to the North Korean border, has been virtually emptied out, with most of its forces sent to Belarus.”\n\nWhatever happens, “there’s only one thing we know with certainty about how a war would play out in Ukraine: it would be unpredictable,” Frida Ghitis wrote. “It’s not going to unfold precisely as military planners predict, no matter how detailed and well thought-out they might be. … It’s the geopolitical manifestation of the wisdom famously imparted by former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson: ‘Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.’”\n\nIn the New York Times, Thomas L. Friedman argued that “if Vladimir Putin opts to back away from invading Ukraine, even temporarily, it’s because Joe Biden – that guy whose right-wing critics suggest is so deep in dementia he wouldn’t know Kyiv from Kansas or AARP from NATO – has matched every Putin chess move with an effective counter of his own.” The threat to Ukraine, Friedman wrote, has been “an electroshock to the heart of the NATO alliance, a bolt that brought it out of its sclerosis like nothing else since the end of the Cold War.”\n\nStill, he noted, Putin could launch an invasion. What the Russian president fears most of all, in Friedman’s view is not the unlikely prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, but rather “the expansion of the E.U.’s sphere of influence and the prospect that it would midwife a decent, democratic, free-market Ukraine that would every day say to the Russian people, ‘This is what you could be without Putin.’”\n\nOlympic wipeout\n\nScott Stantis/Chicago Tribune\n\nAs a child, ice dancer Kaitlyn Weaver dreamed of reaching the Olympics – and she realized that goal competing for Canada at the 2014 and 2018 Games.\n\nWatching the figure skating competition at this year’s Beijing Games amid the controversy over Russian athlete Kamila Valieva’s positive drug test has been painful for Weaver and so many others, not least Valieva herself.\n\nThe 15-year-old Russian skater was allowed to compete in the individual event Thursday, but instead of leading the field as many had expected, she stumbled, fell and finished fourth.\n\n“An ethereal, beloved sport intertwined with a storied past of scandal and controversy, figure skating is as confusing as it is beautiful,” wrote Weaver. “Loss of faith in knowing that fair play will prevail has damaged our sport and our morale. And while Russia has laid the foundation for much of our sport’s history, it is also seemingly at the root of every disparaging news headline.”\n\nIf a country can’t follow the rules, Weaver observed, “they shouldn’t be allowed to participate at all. This travesty of an Olympic event we are finding ourselves in has had many failures. The first was not banning Russia after the findings of systemic, state-sponsored doping during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi. Proof of cheating, doping, switched out samples through a hole in the wall, and government funding were all found to be true. If you haven’t watched the movie ‘Icarus,’ the depth of manipulation and threats might shock you. And I wouldn’t be surprised if it makes you want to turn your back on sport altogether.”\n\nFor more:\n\nAmy Bass: Even if Kamila Valieva wins, she loses.\n\nThe problem with raw cookie dough\n\nWalt Handelsman/Times-Picayune\n\nThe Omicron wave has receded in most of the US, and leaders in government and business now have to manage the aftermath. “While rolling back precautionary policies makes sense right now as Covid-19 cases decline and stabilize, it must be stressed that the only way it is safe to return to normal life is with a contingency plan for masking back up if the next variant of concern warrants it,” wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert.\n\nThe argument for “living with Covid” has been that we all take risks, from driving cars to eating rare hamburgers to eating raw cookie dough, and that the possibility of getting the coronavirus is just another risk. Sepkowitz called this a “continued confusion between advice given for individual health and advice given for public health. … Undercooked chicken is not contagious. If you want to take the risk, go for it. Go ahead and skydive all you want as well, perhaps while eating raw cookie dough…Yes, masks and distancing and vaccines effectively do protect a person’s own health. But the CDC has to worry about that guy over there working the cash register and your friend’s frail grandmother and your friend’s frail grandmother’s health aide.”\n\nFor more:\n\nJulian Zelizer: California’s endemic strategy is a vital step forward.\n\nDean Obeidallah: Rand Paul’s convenient U-turn on protests.\n\nPrince Andrew settles\n\nPrince Andrew’s settlement with Virginia Giuffre, who alleged she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, has major implications, wrote Kara Alaimo.\n\n“What has happened is extraordinarily unusual. The son of the Queen of the United Kingdom – a man who is royalty – was stripped of his privileges by his own mother after being accused of sexual misconduct and made to account for his behavior in a foreign court, though he ended up settling with Giuffre out of court.”\n\n“This sends a deafening message to other powerful men: No privileges in the world will enable you to use your power to dodge allegations of sexual abuse … the fact that he has essentially faced royal excommunication, a foreign civil trial and has been made to pay a settlement to her can only have put many other men on notice – and signals to other women who have been victims of sexual abuse that their voices will be heard.”\n\nUpbeat Super Bowl\n\nNever mind the dramatic football game and the widely praised halftime show. For many, the most anticipated parts of the Super Bowl this year, as always, were the ads.\n\nIn Tim Calkins’ view, the key takeaway of the commercials was that “Americans are fatigued by the pandemic, and are looking forward to brighter days ahead.”\n\nWriting for CNN Business Perspectives, he noted, “Most years, the Super Bowl is a mix of humorous, cheerful spots and more thoughtful, emotional advertising. For every funny Bud Light spot, there is typically a more serious ad, like Google’s wistful “Loretta” spot in 2020, or Airbnb’s “We Accept” ad from 2017. This year, the tone was relentlessly upbeat. Only a few advertisers tried to address anything remotely serious …\n\n“There was almost no mention of the pandemic, aside from an ad from testing company Cue. There were no masks, no thank-yous to the first responders, no reminders to get a booster. There weren’t even subtle references to it…”\n\nWhat was new? “A slew of ads for two technologies that are transforming the country and becoming more widely accepted: crypto and electric vehicles.”\n\nDrew Sheneman/The Star Ledger\n\nTrump’s travails\n\nFormer President Donald Trump suffered a string of reversals this week: documents revealed that his longtime accounting firm said it would stop working with the Trump organization and noted that 10 years of his company’s financial statements could no longer be relied on; a judge ruled that Trump and several of his children would have to give depositions in the investigation of his business empire’s finances by New York’s attorney general; and another judge said Trump couldn’t automatically claim immunity in lawsuits regarding the January 6 Capitol riot.\n\nThe “court rulings are forcing Donald Trump to think about a future when the world will learn more truths about the former president than it has ever known, and he may suffer crushing injuries to his mystique and his bottom line,” wrote Michael D’Antonio.\n\n“The fight over the truth about Trump’s wealth and business operations was always going to become a family affair. As soon as they became adults, Trump made his children top executives. Nestled behind the walls of secrecy granted to privately-held firms, they were trusted to do business his way, which meant they polished the image of wealth and success that was central to his identity.”\n\nDon’t miss\n\nGuthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons and Maggie Siddiqi: Why one Tennessee couple’s struggle to adopt should set off alarm bells\n\nAmit Paley and Joe Saunders: Florida’s ‘don’t say gay bill’ is cruel and dangerous\n\nErik Lundh: Why inflation is about to peak\n\nJanneke Ratcliffe: How we can solve the nation’s affordable housing crisis\n\nAnd…\n\nLBJ\n\nKeystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhen Joe Biden took the oath of office as President last year in the midst of a pandemic, after an insurrection at the Capitol and at a time when millions of Americans were demanding racial justice, some analysts likened the stakes of the moment to the start of Lyndon B. Johnson’s presidency following the assassination of John F. Kennedy.\n\nHistorian Tim Naftali noted that Johnson and Biden “both believed that the country craved more than the competent pragmatism that had defined their long tenures as US senators. Both men thought the national traumas that gave birth to their presidencies would create a magnetic pull to the left.” (A CNN series “LBJ: Triumph and Tragedy” begins Sunday at 9 p.m. ET.)\n\n“But the legislative comparison stops there: with ambition, not achievement,” Naftali wrote. Although Biden can take credit for the infrastructure bill and his Covid relief package, they pale in comparison to the rush of legislation under Johnson, including the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, the Voting Rights Act and the “war on poverty.”\n\nIt’s not Biden’s fault. Last year “wasn’t 1965” and “this isn’t like the moment that LBJ mastered so brilliantly. It is much, much harder, politically, and Joe Biden is not LBJ. Instead, Biden should be assessed on his own terms and in the context of his own time. With almost no margin for error in either House of Congress, an ideologically diverse (let alone iconoclastic) caucus, a partisan Republican bloc, and amid a politically divisive pandemic, it is remarkable Biden got much of anything passed…”\n\n“The President and his congressional allies might keep that in mind as they consider how to make effective use of the power they do have before the midterms this November, when they will face the voters again and ask for more.”", "authors": ["Richard Galant"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2015/11/24/whats-your-fave-album-every-year-your-life/73694002/", "title": "What's your fave album — for every year of your life?", "text": "Chris Shields\n\nclshields@stcloudtimes.com\n\nI find it is good policy to give credit where it is due. I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M. Toss in a bit of Bruce Springsteen. Add a pinch of Roger Waters. Mix it up, and you get some music resembling Arcade Fire's \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nDon't you hate trying to describe how a group or an album sounds to someone who hasn't heard it? What you hear, the similarities or echoes, may hit others differently. \"Th", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/middleeast/saudi-arabia-biggest-rave-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Saudi Arabia is hosting one of the world's biggest raves | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nElectronic music, strobe lights, glittered faces and hundreds of thousands of people in mixed-gender gyrations are all part of a new kind of ritual in Saudi Arabia that didn’t exist just three years ago.\n\nThe kingdom’s Soundstorm music festival, which began in 2019, is back again for its fourth year and will start on Thursday.\n\nIn just five years since Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on musical events, the kingdom’s concert scene has arguably outshined even that of Dubai, long seen as the Gulf region’s premier entertainment hub.\n\nThe country that has been better known as the birthplace of Islam than a rave capital has gone through a tremendous makeover since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) took control of the everyday running of the kingdom in 2017. Soundstorm is an eye-catching symbol of that change.\n\nFor three days every winter, hundreds of thousands of people from across Saudi Arabia and the region descend on a desert site outside the capital Riyadh to listen to some of the top Western and Arab acts .\n\nThe rave is a manifestation of the ethos behind Saudi Arabia’s socioeconomic transformation, according to Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “(It) is a particularly powerful example because it seeks to bring together young people and women from across Saudi Arabia and the world,” she said.\n\nDavid Guetta, Post Malone and Bruno Mars are just a few of the stars performing at this year’s event, which prides itself as being “the loudest festival in the region,” aiming to “amplify the unseen” as it supports local and international music in the Middle East. Tickets cost between 149 riyals (around $40) for a single day and 6,699 riyals (around $1,800 ) for a three-day VIP treatment.\n\nThe festival reportedly welcomed 730,000 partygoers last year. By contrast, Las Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival, considered North America’s biggest dance music festival, had an attendance of over 400,000 this year.\n\nAn event like Soundstorm was inconceivable in the country just six years ago, when the notorious religious police would roam the streets and censure Saudis for mixing with the opposite sex or flouting social norms. But it is now part of a liberalization initiative spearheaded by MBS, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. It accompanies a series of steps to relax social rules, including lifting the ban on women’s driving and reining in the religious police.\n\nIn 2016, Saudi Arabia established the General Entertainment Authority in tandem with Vision 2030 – the crown prince’s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, which accounts for more than half of the government’s revenue. Among its goals was to almost double household spending on cultural and entertainment activities within the kingdom. Riyadh is now seeing more than $64 billion in entertainment investment, reported Arab News, with a significant proportion of that going to the live music industry.\n\nVision 2030 prides itself on offering “world-class entertainment” and says that it has organized up to 3,800 entertainment events in the country, attended by more than 80 million people.\n\n“The whole principle about allowing festivals is to provide youth with domestic entertainment and local tourism opportunities so they don’t need to travel abroad in search of fun,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst.\n\nSome conservatives may find the festival unacceptable, Shihabi said, but given that youth make up the majority of the country’s population, they remain the primary beneficiaries.\n\nAround two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population is 34 years old or younger, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. Analysts say it’s the youth that MBS needs to placate, not the conservatives.\n\nAlcohol continues to be banned in the kingdom, as are sexual relations between men, and unmarried couples.\n\nThe festival is not, however, without international criticism and accusations of whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that performers should either “speak up” about Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations or not attend the festival at all.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars hosting massive entertainment and cultural events in a deliberate (attempt) to whitewash the country’s abysmal human rights record and the Soundstorm music festival is no different,” Joey Shea, a researcher at HRW told CNN. “The creation of the country’s local entertainment industry was accompanied by waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, human rights defenders and ordinary Saudi citizens.”\n\nShihabi rejects the argument that the festival whitewashes the country’s rights record, saying that it “has little to do with any global image and is purely focused on servicing local needs.”\n\nMdlbeast, the organizers of Soundstorm, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nSome however argue that opening up countries to international norms and values can allow for better discussion on human rights shortcomings.\n\n“I think there is a way for these major international events – whether that be the World Cup in Qatar or music festivals in Saudi Arabia – to help open public discourse to critical debate,” said Jacobs.\n\n“They can help cultivate healthy criticism and discussion around human rights issues in the region,” she added, “and as the Gulf continues to solidify its position as the region’s center of gravity, I think this is what we will see.”\n\nIran protests\n\nThe families of Iran’s World Cup football team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players failed to “behave” ahead of the match against the United States on Tuesday, a source involved in the security of the games said.\n\nFollowing the refusal of Iranian players to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe source said that they were told that their families would face “violence and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization said on Tuesday that at least 448 people have been killed in the unrest surrounding the protests. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll.\n\nMembers of the activist art group Pussy Riot wore shirts in support of Iranian protesters at Tuesday’s World Cup game between Iran and the United States in Doha.\n\nTwo Iranian footballers were freed from detention on Tuesday, according to reports. Voria Ghafouri, who was facing charges of incitement against the regime, was released on bail, reported Iranian judiciary news site Mizan News. And a former member of Iran’s national team, Parviz Boroumand, who was arrested during protests in Tehran, was also released, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna announced Monday that a third tranche of European Union sanctions against Iran is “being prepared” over the ongoing repression of protests.\n\nThe digest\n\nQatar to send 2 million tons of LNG to Germany in new energy deal\n\nQatarEnergy signed a deal on Tuesday that will allow Germany to receive flows of Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) over a period of at least 15 years, Qatar’s state news agency QNA said. The deal is the first of its kind to Europe from the expansion project of Qatar’s North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and is meant to make up for some of the shortage triggered by Russian supply cuts.\n\nBackground: Until the Ukraine war, Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas. Talks with Qatar have been in the works for months, as Germany and other European countries try to find alternative energy sources as the market tightens following sanctions on Russian supplies. The contract provides Germany with two million tons of LNG annually and the first shipment is due in 2026.\n\nWhy it matters: Tensions were high this month as Germany ramped up its criticism of Qatar ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, questioning its human rights record and later opposing the Gulf country’s ban on the rainbow-colored armband. Europe’s biggest economy has been running short on natural gas, with German economy minister Robert Habeck previously saying that rationing could not be ruled out ahead of the coming winter.\n\nUS State Department approves potential anti-drone system sale to Qatar for $1 billion\n\nThe US State Department has approved the potential sale of an anti-drone system to Qatar in a deal valued at $1 billion, Reuters cited the Pentagon as saying on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon said.\n\nBackground: The potential sale approval comes after US President Joe Biden earlier this year designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally of the US, granting special status to a key friend in a turbulent region. Separately, Qatar has also played a role in the Iran nuclear talks and in relations with Afghanistan, where Washington’s interests were represented by the small Gulf country.\n\nWhy it matters: The approval comes as the use of drones rises in Middle East warfare. In 2019, a drone attack blamed on Iran knocked off half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Iran, which has friendly relations with Doha, has also been accused by the US of supplying Russia with drones in its war with Ukraine. The Pentagon said the proposed sale will improve Qatar’s capability to meet threats by providing electronic and kinetic defeat capabilities against drones.\n\nUS-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fear Turkish ground invasion could start in a week\n\nThe head of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Tuesday said a Turkish ground invasion could take place in a matter of days if Turkey does not see forceful opposition to a military incursion from countries such as the US and Russia.\n\nBackground: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has launched a recent series of airstrikes against Kurdish militants in northern Syria, and has warned that a ground operation will soon follow. The operation is meant to target Kurdish groups that Turkey believes were behind a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul earlier this month.\n\nWhy it matters: The SDF’s backbone is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey considers a wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and seeks to eliminate. But the group has been instrumental in the fight against ISIS since 2014 and has warned that a Turkish assault will complicate the fight against the militants. It is unclear if the US will heed its calls to restrain Turkey. The US has reduced the number of patrols with SDF ahead of a possible incursion.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nQatar’s World Cup chief Hassan Al-Thawadi said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan which aired on TalkTV on Monday, Al-Thawadi was asked about the number of migrant workers fatalities due to construction for the World Cup and said: “The estimate is around 400, between 400 and 500.\n\n“I don’t have the exact number, that’s something that’s been discussed. One death is too many, it’s as simple as that.”\n\nIn November 2022, a government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on World Cup stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe US men’s team advanced to the knockout stage with a hard-fought victory over Iran. US President Joe Biden celebrated the win by saying, “They did it. God love ‘em” and not all Iranians were lamenting their team’s loss.\n\nThe match between Portugal and Uruguay was briefly interrupted by a pitch invader waving a rainbow flag on the field at the Lusail Iconic Stadium on Monday.\n\nUS captain Tyler Adams apologized on Monday after being told an Iranian journalist that he had been pronouncing the country’s name incorrectly as “EYE-RAN” instead of “ee-RON.”\n\nAround the region\n\nA rendition of the Rashid Rover provided by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre\n\nOn Thursday, the UAE is set to become the first Arab country to launch a mission to the moon. The Rashid Rover will begin its trip from Cape Canaveral Space Station in Florida where it aims to land on the lunar surface in the coming months.\n\nBeginning construction in 2017, the solar-powered rover has been developed by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) and is named after the emirate’s late ruler Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed.\n\nThe rover will take a low-energy route and is expected to land on the lunar surface in March 2023. The vehicle will be delivered by the Japanese HAKUTO-R lander and will touch down on the Atlas crater.\n\nIt will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days Earth time) where it will analyze the plasma of the moon’s surface and conduct experiments on lunar dust. It will then spend another lunar day in which it will attempt to survive the moon’s harsh environment, before decommissioning.\n\nThe launch aims to be the first step in the UAE’s greater space prospects. By 2117, the country aims to have a colony built on Mars’s surface. “We are starting small,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC, told CNN. “But we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”\n\nThe UAE launched a mission to Mars in February last year.\n\nBy Ollie Macnaughton\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/27/pion-problems-star-trek-whiskey-lockkeepers-house-news-around-states/50147887/", "title": "Piñon problems, Star Trek whiskey: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal judge will hear arguments next month on whether to block enforcement of a state law outlawing the use of gender-affirming medications to treat transgender people under age 19. The May 5 hearing is scheduled just days before the law is set to take effect May 8. U.S. District Judge Liles Burke set the evidentiary hearing, scheduled to last up to two days, on a request for a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to stop Alabama officials from enforcing the law while a court challenge goes forward. The law will make it a felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for medical providers to give puberty blockers and hormones to transgender people under age 19 to help affirm their gender identity. Four families with transgender children, two doctors and a member of the clergy filed a lawsuit challenging the law as an unconstitutional violation of equal protection and free speech rights and an intrusion into parental decisions.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Airlines says it’s canceling nonstop flights between Anchorage and Honolulu during the summer months, primarily because of limited staffing. The suspension will last from June until November. Alaska Airlines Public Affairs Manager Tim Thompson said no other major nonstop routes to and from Anchorage were affected, KTUU reports. Alaska Airlines has struggled with staffing levels this month, as pilots protested and the airline said it encountered a backlog in its training program while it worked to bring on more pilots. The company had 63 fewer pilots ready to fly in April than it had planned on in January, it said. Travelers between Alaska and Hawaii may have to use connecting flights in Seattle; Portland, Oregon or Los Angeles as alternatives. An Alaska Airlines spokesperson said in an email to the Associated Press that the airline has offered seasonal service on the Anchorage-Honolulu route in the past. The airline also plans to resume nonstop service from Anchorage to Maui and Anchorage to Kailua-Kona on the Big Island in the fall. The airline doesn’t operate these routes during the summer.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Legislation that greatly expands the rights of parents to know anything their children tell a teacher or school counselor and allows them to sue if information is withheld is headed to Republican Gov. Doug Ducey’s desk. The parental rights bill sponsored by state Rep. Steve Kaiser was approved along party lines by the House on Monday. Changes made in the Senate, which passed the bill with no Democratic backing last week, required a second House vote. Kaiser had previously stripped the measure of major penalty provisions for teachers to get enough votes for its initial House passage. The broad expansion of the state’s parents’ bill of rights no longer will lead to fines, suspensions or dismissal for teachers or other school employees. But it does allow lawsuits against any school district or official for violations and requires them to prove they did not interfere with a parent’s rights. The House also gave final approval to a bill that expands the ability of parents to review books in school libraries and requires a 60-day review period for titles being considered for addition by librarians. Republicans say some schools are allowing books that contain inappropriate content on sex or sexual orientations in their collections. Democrats said both bills are overreactions that target teachers, and the parent’s rights bill will put children at risk.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The Sebastian County judge wants to use federal COVID-19 dollars to fund a sobering center until 2026. County Judge David Hudson proposed that the quorum court use $2.5 million of the American Rescue Plan money to pay for a sobering center, where officers can take people accused of low-level, alcohol-related offenses, instead of taking them to jail. The center could also be used for people who have committed low-level crimes related to substance abuse, said Rusti Holwick, the CEO of The Guidance Center. “It really helps to just keep people out of jail who are nonviolent offenders,” Holwick said. The sobering center will be a safe place where medical staff will monitor those intoxicated and allow them to become stable. Hudson plans to have an upcoming meeting to exclusively discuss what the American Rescue Plan money should fund. At a follow-up meeting, the quorum court members will decide whether to provide money for the sobering center through the federal act. If people volunteer to go to the center – where they would stay until becoming sober – charges would be dropped, Hudson said. A typical stay would last about 12 hours.\n\nCalifornia\n\nHuntington Beach: A report issued Monday urges a coastal panel to deny a proposal to build a $1.4 billion desalination plant that would draw on the ocean to expand water sources in Southern California. Staff for the California Coastal Commission recommended the panel reject Poseidon Water’s proposal to build the 50 million gallon-a-day facility in Huntington Beach. The project is up for discussion before the panel May 12. “This project raises significant and complex coastal protection policy issues,” staff wrote, “including conformity with policies that require protection of marine life, water quality, environmentally sensitive habitat areas, and policies meant to avoid or minimize hazards associated with sea level rise, floods, tsunamis, and geologic hazards.” The staff also wrote that the proposal raises “significant issues” about potential impacts on environmental justice communities. It also lacks details about who would ultimately buy Poseidon’s water and at what cost, according to the report. Poseidon Water said it believed the commission staff erred in its recommendation. “No water infrastructure project in the state of California has ever undergone this level of study and scrutiny,” the company said in a statement. “If this recommendation stands, it will effectively be the death knell for desalination in California.”\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: NOCO Distillery founder and master blender Sebastien Gavillet is busy commissioning custom bottle corks affixed with Star Trek figurines and dealing with a rush of new customers after a bottle of the distillery’s “Bourbon II” whiskey appeared on the latest season of Paramount+ series “Star Trek: Picard.” The bottle, shown during a bar scene, appeared on screen for a few seconds – just long enough for fans to pause and make out its name, batch, cask, bottle numbers, and the distillery’s logo and hometown: Fort Collins, Colorado. “I was floored,” said Gavillet, who woke up to a flurry of text messages and calls after the episode dropped on the streaming service. NOCO Distillery had dipped its toes in product placement thanks to Mark McFann, a distillery customer and owner of Cast a Long Shadow, a Fort Collins-based product placement company. Seeing it as an interesting marketing opportunity, Gavillet said NOCO Distillery also pursued small placements on Netflix’s “Lucifer,” the new Ben Affleck movie “Deep Water” and Peacock’s “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” reboot, “Bel-Air.” While most of those placements were minor, Bourbon II’s extended appearance on “Star Trek: Picard” was “very unique,” he said. “People started showing up at the distillery ... waiting outside before it opened,” Gavillet said. “We started getting a lot of Trekkies as regulars.” He’s planning a special release of Bourbon II that will reflect the same batch and barrel number featured on the show.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city’s acting police chief was ordered to resign by a judge, who ruled Monday that the chief has held the temporary position longer than the city charter allows. Mayor Justin Elicker immediately vowed to appeal the ruling and said Renee Dominguez would remain acting chief during the legal challenge and until a permanent chief is hired. Dominguez, who has served as acting chief since March 2021, had been on track to become the first woman to permanently lead the New Haven Police Department. But in December, the city’s Board of Alders rejected Elicker’s nomination of her after some residents raised concerns about increasing violent crime and low diversity in the department. In his ruling, Judge Michael Kamp said the city charter prohibits acting city officials – including the police chief – from holding the temporary jobs for more than six months without their names being submitted to the Board of Alders. Elicker did submit Dominguez’s name to the alders within six months, but the board rejected the nomination, the judge said. “The clear import of the city charter is that an acting police chief cannot remain in place indefinitely,” Kamp wrote. “To conclude otherwise would completely thwart and eliminate the Board of Alders’ advice and consent role in approving the mayor’s nominee.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state ranks below the national average in available affordable housing for the lowest-income renters and is one of the most unfriendly to those households in the Mid-Atlantic region, according to a report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “The Gap: A Shortage of Affordable Homes” found no state in the nation offers enough affordable rental homes to accommodate the lowest-income households, with an average of 36 affordable and available rental homes for every 100 households. In Delaware that gap is even starker, with only 31 available homes for every 100 of the lowest-income renters. New Jersey had a similar supply for the lowest-income households with 31 available for every 100 renters. Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania offered 34, 37 and 39 homes for every 100 renters, respectively, according to the report. Seventy-two percent of Delawareans in the lowest-income bracket are spending more than 50% of their income to put a roof over their heads. “In Delaware, we have a shortage of 18,000 affordable and available rental units for the lowest-income renter households,” Rachel Stucker, executive director of Housing Alliance Delaware, said in a news release. “Significant and sustained federal and state-level investments in affordable housing development and preservation are needed. Housing is not optional.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The oldest existing structure on the National Mall has reopened to the public, WUSA-TV reports. The Lockkeeper’s House, on the corner of 17th and Constitution Avenue, is 185 years old and once served as the home of a canal lock tender. Following a restoration project by the Trust for the National Mall, which included moving the house approximately 36 feet to the south and then 35 feet to the west using a hydraulic system, the house now serves as the gateway to the National Mall. According to the National Park Service, tours of the small but mighty house happen daily from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and include an immersive multimedia program to introduce visitors to the evolution and growth of the National Mall. It also includes information about the lockkeeper who collected tolls and managed traffic along the C&O Canal in the 1800s. Originally constructed in 1837 after George Washington advocated for canals in the nation’s capital, the lockkeeper’s house sat at the intersection of the former C&O Canal and Washington Canal. The lockkeeper kept records of merchandise that entered the city. Over the years the canals were filled, and the house evolved to meet the needs of the city, also serving as a tool shed for park staff, a watchman’s lodge, and a temporary holding cell for Park Police. The 540-square-foot house stood neglected for 40 years prior to the Trust for the National Mall’s $6 million effort to restore the building, which began in 2018.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Monday to create a police force dedicated to pursuing voter fraud and other election crimes, embracing a top priority of Republicans after ex-President Donald Trump’s false claims that reelection was stolen from him. The new law comes after the Republican governor made voting legislation a focus this year, pushing the GOP-controlled statehouse to create the policing unit as states reevaluate their own election systems in the wake of Trump’s unfounded allegations. DeSantis, who is running for reelection and widely considered a potential 2024 presidential candidate, has both praised the last election as smooth and suggested more rules were needed to deter fraud, underscoring Trump’s lingering influence on Republican policymaking. Critics have deemed the law politically motivated and unnecessary, arguing that local prosecutors can handle election crimes. At a bill-signing ceremony Monday at a sports bar in Spring Hill, DeSantis justified the need for the new unit and suggested existing law enforcement may not be equipped or willing to thoroughly investigate fraud cases. “Some of them may not care as much about the election stuff. I think it’s been mixed at how those reactions are going to be. So we just want to make sure whatever laws are on the books, that those laws are enforced,” he said. Voter fraud is rare, typically occurs in isolated instances and is generally detected.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: An economic analysis by University of Georgia professors estimates residents of Linnentown are owed upward of $5million in reparations. The study assessed the financial loss from urban renewal in Linnentown, a Black community displaced in the 1960s to create student housing. The preliminary calculations come after the Athens mayor’s office assembled an economic analysis team at the request of the Athens Justice & Memory Project. Jerry Shannon, an associate professor in the Department of Geography and the Department of Financial Planning, Housing, and Consumer Economics, presented the report last week to the Athens Justice & Memory Project. “I think it’s important to note at the outset that our research is not meant to cover all forms of loss,” Shannon said. Through the analysis, it became clear researchers would not be able to effectively capture impacts on employment or education due to displacement, he said. Nor did they have the expertise to create a measure of the emotional trauma of forced displacement. State law also currently prohibits any state agency from giving funds to private individuals. But members of the Athens Justice & Memory Project, a resident-led effort to address the history and impact of urban renewal, discussed requesting funds to address a variety of projects or efforts like affordable housing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Out-of-state visitors will soon need reservations to visit one of the islands’ most recognizable natural sites. State land officials announced Monday that the new policy for Diamond Head State Monument will take effect May 12. The iconic ancient volcanic crater stands at the end of Waikiki Beach on the island of Oahu. Diamond Head is the third state park to have such a rule. Nonresidents must also make reservations for Haena State Park on Kauai and Waianapanapa State Park on Maui. Reservations are required at certain times to visit Haleakala National Park on Maui. Diamond Head can get thousands of visitors per day. The park attendance record was set in 2019 when about 6,000 people came to the site in one day. State officials said the new rules are needed to control damage to the environment and infrastructure, congestion on hiking trails, heavy vehicle traffic and illegal parking. “We want to reduce the impact of visitors and really ensure that our residents have access to these desirable places,” Gov. David Ige said during a visit to Diamond Head last week. “We can control the numbers of people who visit a particular place so they can more easily be spread out across the day.” Hawaii residents do not need reservations to visit the monument, but parking is limited.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A nuclear waste treatment plant in eastern Idaho had two unanticipated shutdowns this year, U.S. officials said Tuesday, continuing a lengthy history of setbacks. Trent Neville of the U.S. Department of Energy said the agency is working on the problems at the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit at the department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory. The plant might start operating later this year. Neville told members of the Environmental Management Site-Specific Advisory Board and Idaho Cleanup Project that the plant ran out of liquid nitrogen in January and also had a rapid automatic shutdown while testing with a simulant material in February. The plant was built to treat 900,000 gallons of sodium-bearing, radioactive waste from processing spent nuclear fuel to recover highly enriched uranium. The waste is in tanks above the Eastern Snake Plain Aquifer that supplies water to cities and farms. The department is paying fines to Idaho for missing a deadline to convert the liquid waste into solid material as stipulated in a 1995 agreement that was the culmination of a series of federal lawsuits. Idaho, because of the missed deadline, is preventing the department from bringing in research quantities of spent nuclear fuel to be studied at the lab.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Jurors on Monday convicted a state Department of Corrections officer for violating the civil rights of an inmate brutally beaten at a western Illinois prison in 2018, but they could not reach a verdict against a superior. Alex Banta, 30, of Quincy, was convicted after a four-week trial in U.S. District Court of conspiracy to deprive civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, obstruction of an investigation, falsification of documents and misleading conduct. Banta faces up to life in prison because jurors also indicated Monday in finding him guilty of the civil rights and conspiracy charges that those crimes led to the death of 65-year-old inmate Larry Earvin. Members of the eight-man, four-woman jury, while unanimous on Banta’s culpability, were split 9-3 on the involvement of co-defendant Lt. Todd Sheffler. The May 17, 2018, beating of inmate Earvin at Western Illinois Correctional Center in Quincy, 250 miles southwest of Chicago, resulted in 15 broken ribs and abdominal injuries so severe a portion of his bowel was surgically removed. He died June 26. Earvin allegedly refused to return to his cell in the housing unit known as R-1, and a disturbance there summoned dozens of officers for an escort to the segregation unit. “Those who were on the fence were on the fence because they didn’t think the assault happened in (segregation),” one juror said.\n\nIndiana\n\nClarksville: The federal government is accusing the town of discriminating against a man with HIV who applied to become a police officer. The Justice Department said it filed a lawsuit Monday against Clarksville, where police had offered a job to a man who was already working as a volunteer reserve officer but then dropped the offer in 2015 based on his HIV status, according to Justice. “No qualified individual should lose a hard-earned career opportunity because of misguided views about their disability that are not supported by medicine or science,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the department’s Civil Rights Division. HIV is a virus that can weaken the immune system. The man’s HIV is “well-controlled with medication and his viral load is, and during all relevant times was, fully suppressed,” the lawsuit says. Clarksville’s town manager, Kevin Baity, said the town is working with the Justice Department to “find an amicable solution.” The man spent 15 months appealing the decision. Clarksville added him back to the list but never hired him, according to the lawsuit. The man got a job with another police department.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: After months of wrangling, state lawmakers have passed a bill to require most gas stations to offer gasoline with higher blends of ethanol at the pump, as Gov. Kim Reynolds seeks to bolster Iowa’s biofuels industry. The bill would require gas stations and other fuel retailers to offer gasoline with 15% ethanol, known as E15, beginning in 2026. That would greatly expand the availability of E15, which is currently available at just a fraction of Iowa’s gas stations and truck stops. The measure passed the state Senate on Tuesday on a 42-3 vote and cleared the House a short time later on a 81-13 vote. It now awaits Reynolds’ signature to become law. “This legislation is good for Iowa,” said the bill’s Senate floor manager, Sen. Waylon Brown, R-Osage. “The legislation opens new markets for Iowa’s ethanol – cleaner, greener renewable fuel.” Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Reynolds praised the bipartisan vote. She is expected to sign the bill, which is one of her legislative priorities. House lawmakers passed a version of the bill in early February, but the measure had languished in the Iowa Senate until this week. The final version of the legislation includes a more robust waiver process that senators estimate will allow hundreds of Iowa gas stations to opt out.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A legislator has complained publicly about having to share women’s restrooms with a “huge” transgender colleague whom she derided as a potential threat to young children who visit the Statehouse. Republican state Rep. Cheryl Helmer on Tuesday stood firmly by her comments in an email to a University of Kansas graduate student while defending a bill she co-sponsored that would make it a felony for doctors to provide hormones or perform gender transition surgery for anyone under 18. She also decried what she called the “in your face” approach to promoting transgender rights by Democratic state Rep. Stephanie Byers, the first transgender elected lawmaker in Kansas. The House speaker called Helmer’s comments “unfortunate,” and Democrats condemned them. The state’s most visible LGBTQ rights lobbyist called for the House to censure Helmer. The Republican-controlled Legislature is trying to override Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto of a ban on transgender athletes in girls’ and women’s K-12 and college sports, and LGBTQ rights advocates say Helmer’s comments prove anti-trans bigotry is behind the measure. “We know this has been going on in offices and back rooms and conversations since the day I was elected,” Byers said Tuesday. “The shocking part is that it came out, that someone actually said it.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Monday cited “drafting errors” in vetoing legislation that had been intended to expand the use of state lottery-supported scholarship money. The Democratic governor said he was supportive of the bill’s original intentions, including expanding scholarship funding for proprietary education under the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship program. The popular state lottery-supported program allows students to earn money, based on academic performance, to help defray college expenses. Beshear said he also shared the bill sponsors’ desire to extend KEES scholarships to nonviolent offenders to support their transition back into society after incarceration. “However, acknowledged drafting errors will lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences that will undermine the bill and the goals it seeks to achieve,” the governor said in his veto message. “It is my hope that early in the next legislative session, those errors can be rectified.” The veto will stand since the measure passed on the final day of this year’s legislative session. Lawmakers won’t reconvene until January 2023 for their next regular session. In recent days, several organizations had urged the governor to veto the measure, saying it would have reduced opportunities for formerly incarcerated people to access state scholarships, contrary to the bill’s original intent.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Johnnie A. Jones Sr., a civil rights attorney and World War II veteran who was wounded during the D-Day invasion of Normandy, has died. Jones was 102 years old. His goddaughter, Mada McDonald, told WAFB-TV that Jones died Saturday at the Louisiana War Veterans’ Home in Jackson. Jones was born Nov. 30, 1919, in Laurel Hill, Louisiana, and raised on Rosemound Plantation by his parents, who farmed 73 acres of land but insisted that their son get an education. He graduated from Southern University and then was drafted in 1942. He became the Army’s first African American warrant officer. Jones said in 2019 that after returning from Europe, he had to move to the back of a bus filled with fellow soldiers as it crossed the Mason-Dixon line separating North from South. “I couldn’t sit with the soldiers I had been on the battlefield with. I had to go to the back of the bus,” he said. Moreover, while traveling to New Orleans to get shrapnel removed from his neck, Jones was pulled over by a white police officer and roughed up. Such events served as a call to action to fight racism. He obtained a law degree and was recruited in 1953 to help organize a bus boycott in Baton Rouge and defend the participants. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King used that event to plan his larger bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, several years later. Jones also defended students arrested during sit-ins as civil rights protests gained momentum in the South. His car was bombed twice.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Construction workers completed their feat of tearing down one bridge and replacing it with another over the weekend, allowing a key stretch of I-295 to reopen Monday morning in Maine’s largest city. The bridge closed Friday evening and reopened by 7:30 a.m., several hours ahead of schedule, for the morning commute. The technique of prefabricating a bridge and quickly moving it into place is the construction equivalent of ripping off a Band-Aid. It reduces highway disruptions to several days compared to an estimated four years of disruptions during typical construction, officials said. This is the first time the Maine Department of Transportation has tried the technique. A vehicle fire necessitated closure of part of the same highway later Monday morning. Fire departments responded to the fire in South Portland and extinguished it.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A police lieutenant won’t be prosecuted in the death of a Black man he shot in the back during an exchange of gunfire last fall, officials said Monday. The shooting happened about 2 a.m. Oct. 11 after Baltimore County police officers responded to a report of an armed robbery at a Woodlawn-area convenience store, according to a report from the Independent Investigations Division of the attorney general’s office. The report said the robber fled, crashed about a mile away and ran. Lt. Gregory Mead, who is white and has been with the department since 1996, responded to the area of the crash and saw Jovan Singleton, who was Black and resembled the description of the robbery suspect, the report says. In a written statement, Mead said he asked Singleton to sit on the curb, but he took off, and Mead followed. Seconds later, Mead said Singleton turned, and Mead saw a muzzle flash, heard a gunshot and, with a second muzzle flash, fell to the ground in pain, feeling like a crow bar hit his knee cap. He said Singleton moved toward him, and he fired. About five hours later, Singleton’s body was found about 173 feet from the shooting scene and 50 feet from a firearm under a car, according to the report. Mead suffered an “incapacitating knee injury” but was not shot, the report says.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nTaunton: A county’s cold case unit is working to identify a dozen unidentified bodies or skeletal remains that have been found through the years, some dating back nearly four decades. Traditional methods using fingerprints or dental records have not resulted in their identification, Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn III said. At least two cases were determined to be homicides. “We are trying to identify these remains so that family members can have some closure and to also determine if a crime was committed,” he said in a news release Friday. “Our Cold Case Unit has been successful in solving multiple cold case homicides and previously unsolved violent sexual assaults. The unit is now expanding its efforts to focus on unidentified remains. If anyone has any information related to these cases, please contact us.” Two of the oldest cases are baby boys who were found dead in the woods. One died of exposure in November 1983 in Freetown; the other, found in Mansfield in January 1985, was born alive, but died a short time later, autopsies showed. The most recent case is a human skull in January 2021, found on the ocean floor southwest of Fish Island in New Bedford.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The police officer who killed Patrick Lyoya with a shot to the head has been with the Grand Rapids department for seven years, after starring as a pole vaulter at a small college and marrying his longtime girlfriend during a church mission trip to Africa. Christopher Schurr’s name had been circulating since his face was seen in videos of the April 4 confrontation with Lyoya, a Black man. But his identity wasn’t publicly acknowledged until Monday, when the police chief changed course and released it, three days after passionate demands at the funeral of the 26-year-old native of Congo. Chief Eric Winstrom said he was acting “in the interest of transparency, to reduce ongoing speculation and to avoid any further confusion,” though no other information about Schurr’s service with the department was released. Lyoya, who was unarmed, was facedown on the ground when he was shot in the back of the head, moments after a traffic stop in Michigan’s second-largest city. Schurr was on top of him and can be heard on video demanding that he take his hand off the white officer’s Taser. A forensic pathologist who conducted an autopsy at the family’s request said the gun was pressed to Lyoya’s head when he was shot.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge has ruled that the trial of three fired police officers charged with aiding and abetting George Floyd’s killing will not be livestreamed. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill, who cited the threat of COVID-19 to allow livestreaming of last year’s murder trial of Derek Chauvin in Floyd’s death, wrote in an order filed Monday evening that the pandemic has receded to the point that he cannot override the other three officers’ objections to live audio-visual coverage. The trial for former Officers Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng is set to begin with motions June 13. Jury selection begins June 14 with opening statements set for July 5. Cahill said he expects the evidence phase to take four or five weeks, meaning the trial could last into early August. Kueng knelt on Floyd’s back, Lane held his legs, and Thao kept bystanders back as Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin Floyd, a Black man, to the pavement for 91/ 2 minutes on May 25, 2020, in a case that sparked protests around the world and a national reckoning on race. Thao, Lane and Kueng were convicted in a separate trial in federal court in February of violating Floyd’s civil rights. Chauvin pleaded guilty in December to a federal charge of violating Floyd’s civil rights. Sentencing dates have not been set in those cases, which were not televised due to federal court rules.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: On a day that many state and local government offices were closed for Confederate Memorial Day, protesters said Monday that the state needs to stop commemorating the Confederacy. Several members of Indivisible Northeast Mississippi held signs denouncing the holiday in front of a Confederate monument at the old Lee County Courthouse in Tupelo, the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports. Mississippi law designates the last Monday in April as Confederate Memorial Day. The protesters also criticized Republican Gov. Tate Reeves for issuing a proclamation that April is Confederate Heritage Month. “You have to ask yourself: ‘OK, what heritage is that?’ That heritage is one of white supremacy, the right to enslave human beings for economic gain,” said Mary Jane Meadows. Every Mississippi governor since Republican Kirk Fordice in the 1990s has issued a proclamation of April as Confederate Heritage Month, and Reeves said April 13 that he “didn’t think this was the year to stop doing it.” Daniel Jenkins of Tupelo said he was protesting Monday because, as a Black man, he doesn’t subscribe to the Confederate observances. Jenkins sees them as enduring signs of systemic racism, he said, urging others to join the fight against them.\n\nMissouri\n\nGrain Valley: A suburban Kansas City school board has told teachers at a high school to remove cards and stickers showing support for LGBTQ students. The Grain Valley school board sent an email to families Monday saying members had “received a concern” about the cards and stickers some high school teachers were displaying to tell students they could approach them regarding LGBTQ questions, The Kansas City Star reports. “We remain committed to providing professional development to help our staff create a safe, collaborative, and inclusive environment, consistent with our core beliefs, where each student feels a sense of belonging,” the email said. “The use of these cards, however, is determined to not be an appropriate step at this time.” Some parents, teachers and advocates in the district opposed the decision. Travis Holt, a Grain Valley graduate who is gay, called the decision “disheartening” and said he is asking the school board to reconsider to “keep the students’ best interests at heart rather than buckling under pressure from a select few parents.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park is seeking Native American vendors and artists to participate in the upcoming buffalo kite festival and craft fair. The festival is held July 9-10 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and will feature buffalo-themed kites made by Native artists nationwide. Artists will share information about their kites, and visitors will be invited to create their own kites to fly over the buffalo jump. Attendees can also make traditional Indigenous game pieces and dolls to take home. Alice Southworth, a park ranger, said she hopes Native American artists and vendors “share their traditional knowledge and passion with our visitors.” For more information, contact Southworth at 406-866-2217 or alice.southworth@mt.gov, and visit fwp.mt.gov/first-peoples-buffalo-jump.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Firefighters took advantage of higher humidity and calmer winds Monday to work toward containing a wildfire in rural southwestern Nebraska that has killed one person, injured at least 15 firefighters and destroyed at least six homes, an official said. Jonathan Ashford, spokesman for the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team, said more than 80 firefighters, emergency management personnel and others were helping fight the fire, known as the Road 702 Fire. It had burned nearly 65 square miles in Red Willow, Furnas and Frontier counties by late Sunday. Officials initially reported the fire was spread over more than 78 square miles of mostly rolling rangeland, but Ashford said aerial mapping Sunday gave a more accurate size of the blaze. The fire that began last week has been fueled by tinder-dry conditions and days of strong winds. More favorable weather Monday had firefighters scrambling to dig trenches and create other breaks along the blaze’s perimeter, Ashford said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A federal judge said Monday that he’ll decide in three weeks whether to dismiss a condemned killer’s lawsuit challenging Nevada’s plan for his lethal injection because the state doesn’t have one of the drugs it would use. U.S. District Judge Richard Boulware II acknowledged during a brief hearing with attorneys for the state and the inmate, Zane Michael Floyd, that key questions about the execution method remain unanswered following weeks of testimony late last year. But the Nevada Department of Corrections supply of the sedative ketamine expired Feb. 28, and Randall Gilmer, chief deputy state attorney general, said prison officials have been unable to get more. The prison execution method, or protocol, calls for using large doses of three or four drugs also including the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl or a substitute, alfentanil, possibly a muscle paralytic called cisatracurium, and either potassium chloride or potassium acetate to stop Floyd’s heart. Boulware said the question before him might have become moot. “There is no foreseeable likelihood that NDOC would be able to obtain one of the main drugs in the protocol,” Boulware said, adding that there also is no current warrant for Floyd’s death. State law calls for two weeks’ notice to schedule an execution and for them to be performed by lethal injection.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has a good track record when it comes to elections, but it would benefit from a voter confidence commission to address residents’ concerns in a time of political polarization, its new secretary of state said Tuesday. “It is clear to me that for some time now, a few years, that there’s just a decline, both nationally and in the state of New Hampshire, on general voters’ belief about the accuracy of election results,” David Scanlan said at a news conference from his Statehouse office. “I felt that it’s really important to initiate a discussion on that topic – a very public one – involving some very capable people with diverse interests, so we kind of get to the bottom of why we find ourselves in a situation, and how we can put the brakes on it and turn that trend around.” Scanlan replaced Bill Gardner, who retired in January after 45 years of overseeing elections, the state archives and other divisions. Scanlan had served as deputy secretary of state for 20 years. The announcement came months after an audit of a legislative race in Windham, where a discrepancy drew the attention of ex-President Donald Trump and his supporters seeking to bolster unfounded claims of election fraud. The audit showed the cause of the discrepancy was not a vote counting machine but a separate machine used to fold absentee ballots. But those who reject that conclusion have been pushing for either getting rid of automated counting machines or performing audits.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Reports of antisemitic incidents in the state climbed to a record high last year, returning to pre-pandemic levels and seemingly boosted by heightened Middle East tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. There were 370 such incidents in New Jersey last year, a 25% increase over 2020 and part of a nationwide trend of rising harassment and violence against Jews, according to a report Tuesday from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization. The report came a day after the Council on American-Islamic Relations said complaints of harassment against Muslim Americans had also reached a record high last year. New Jersey and its diverse communities were at the center of both troubling trends, with anti-Jewish or Muslim incidents making national headlines in Teaneck, Ridgefield, Clifton, Lakewood and other towns, the groups said. “We are alarmed by the dramatic increase in antisemitic incidents in New Jersey – (a) disturbing fact emblematic of a larger national problem,” Scott Richman, the regional director of the ADL’s New York/New Jersey office, said in a statement. The ADL documented the highest number of incidents in areas with among the highest Jewish populations in the region: Bergen County recorded 70 and Ocean County 44.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Collecting piñon nuts has been tradition for Native American and Hispanic families in the Southwest for generations. But environmentalists are concerned that without the pinyon jay – a very social bird that essentially plants the next generation of trees by stashing away the seeds – it’s possible the piñon forests of New Mexico and other Western states could face another reproductive hurdle in the face of climate change, persistent drought and more severe wildfires. The Washington, D.C.-based group Defenders of Wildlife filed a petition Monday with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to protect the bird under the Endangered Species Act, saying the once common species plays an integral role in the high desert ecosystem. The group points to research that shows pinyon jay numbers have declined by an estimated 80% over the past five decades, a rate even faster than the greater sage grouse. Patricia Estrella, who represents the group in New Mexico, said that while population declines are well documented, the exact cause remains unclear as multiple threats are at play. Piñon-juniper forests cover more than 75,000 square miles in the United States, and wildlife managers in New Mexico and six other states already have classified the bird as a species of greatest conservation need. Nearly 60% of the jay’s remaining population can be found in New Mexico and Nevada, but its range also includes parts of California, Oklahoma, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming and Mexico’s Baja California.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The failure of security cameras in the subway station where a gunman opened fire this month is the subject of an investigation. “As the horrific mass shooting two weeks ago in Sunset Park has raised questions about the MTA camera system, the Office of the Inspector General has initiated an inquiry into why the cameras were not transmitting on April 12 and a review of the maintenance and repair program for the critical equipment,” Acting Metropolitan Transportation Authority Inspector General Elizabeth Keating said in a statement Monday announcing the probe. Police acknowledged that security cameras in three stations weren’t working on the morning of April 12, including the Brooklyn station where the gunman set off a smoke device and shot 10 people. The MTA has nearly 10,000 cameras at its 472 subway stations, and other cameras in nearby stations helped police track suspect Frank James’ movements before and after the shooting. James also left behind a bag containing weapons, smoke grenades and the key to a U-Haul truck he had driven. The truck was found parked near a station where authorities believe James entered the subway dressed in construction clothing. He was apprehended the following day in New York and charged with a federal terrorism offense.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMorrisville: A bipartisan panel of education leaders, legislators, and representatives of government agencies and outside groups on Monday recommended ways to improve North Carolina’s public education and access to it, from preschool to universities. Members of the Hunt-Lee Commission, which was formed to address inequities in student outcomes, backed 16 proposals, some of which need General Assembly approval. Others require better coordination between entities that already have authority to act, the report’s authors said. The commission, which met four times starting in August, praised current successes in education and discussed ways to make the system better. The report also urged testing new ideas, such as monetary incentives and benefits to make early childhood education an attractive career. Pilot programs should be created to encourage increasing spaces for toddlers and infants in child care centers through incentives, another recommendation said. As children get older, school systems could develop programs to ease the transition for students from middle school to high school, the report said. And providing in-state college tuition rates to some high school graduates in the state who lack legal residency could be considered, the report said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Federal investigators say a cyberattack on a company that provides software and billing services for doctors and health care professionals affected more than a half-million customers. Williston-based Adaptive Health Integrations was the target of a hacking incident that happened in mid-October, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The data breach was reported to the government earlier this month. “An unauthorized individual may have accessed a limited amount of data stored on our systems,” the company said in a release. “Upon learning of the issue, we contained the threat by disabling unauthorized access to our network and commenced a prompt and thorough investigation with assistance from external cybersecurity professionals.” The federal government says the security breach affected 510,574 people, KVRR radio reports. The company said some of the data could have contained personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact information, and Social Security numbers. It does not affect all Adaptive Health Integrations patients, and not all information was included for all individuals, the statement said.\n\nOhio\n\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base: An Air Force major general who was convicted on one of three specifications of an abusive sexual contact charge was told Tuesday he would receive a reprimand and must forfeit $10,910 of monthly pay for five months. Maj. Gen. William Cooley, 56, was found guilty Saturday in what was the first-ever military trial of an Air Force general. The weeklong court-martial at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio had three specifications, one accusing Cooley of a forcible kiss and two alleging forcible touching in 2018. Cooley was convicted of the forcible kissing specification but acquitted of the other two. Cooley had the option of a trial by court member jurors or by military judge and chose to have the case heard by the judge. He had faced a maximum punishment of dismissal, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for seven years. Speaking after the sentencing hearing, Cooley’s civilian attorney, Dan Conway, told the Dayton Daily News that his client is “very thankful for the judge’s compassion here.” Conway said the punishment was “a very significant sentence,” and he said a letter of reprimand may have implications in terms of the rank at which Cooley will be allowed to retire, if he chooses to do so.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A Republican lawmaker who wanted to refer to himself as “The Patriot” on the ballot can’t use that nickname, the Oklahoma Election Board has ruled. The board decided Monday that term-limited state Rep. Sean Roberts can still run for state labor commissioner, but he can’t refer to himself by that nickname on the ballot. Oklahoma election rules allow a candidate to use a nickname if it’s a name by which the candidate is generally known or under which they do business. Roberts’ opponent, Republican Labor Commissioner Leslie Osborn, said there’s no evidence Roberts is known as “The Patriot.” She pointed out in her petition to the board that Roberts has appeared on the ballot in seven successive elections as Kevin Sean Roberts or Sean Roberts. Roberts said in a statement that he’s considering appealing the board’s decision. Also on Monday, the board rejected a petition by Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jason Bollinger to have his Democratic opponent, Madison Horn, removed from the ballot. Bollinger alleged Horn’s candidacy declaration was incomplete. The two are seeking the Democratic nomination in the U.S. Senate race for the seat currently held by Republican U.S. Sen. James Lankford.\n\nOregon\n\nAstoria: Wildlife officials have voted to end a summer steelhead hatchery program on the North Umpqua River after severe declines in the number of wild steelhead returning from the Pacific Ocean each summer, agency officials and environmentalists said. The 4-3 vote by the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission transitions the agency to a “wild fish only” management plan in an attempt to help the genetically distinct wild summer steelhead bounce back. Wild winter steelhead, which do not have a hatchery program, remain strong. No smolts were released into the North Umpqua last summer either because of wildfires. Environmental groups said they owed the commission a “debt of gratitude” for taking the vote. State officials closed sport fishing on the Umpqua and North Umpqua rivers last summer in response to record-low wild summer steelhead returns. “We are thrilled to see the Commission end the hatchery summer steelhead program,” said Karl Konecny of the group Steamboaters, which is part of a coalition of environmental and angler groups that supported an end to the hatchery program. “The continued presence of hatchery fish on the spawning beds would have slowed the recovery and depressed the eventual size of the wild steelhead run.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nSomerset: A suspended western Pennsylvania prosecutor facing charges in a sexual assault case has now been charged in an unrelated assault almost a year ago. Jeffrey Thomas, 36, Somerset County’s elected district attorney, was jailed Monday on charges of simple assault, reckless endangerment and harassment after state police alleged that he was seen on a video call punching a woman as the two rode in a vehicle in May 2021. Authorities said a woman said she was on the call and saw Thomas punch the other woman at least 10 times in the head and face. She said she determined the alleged assault took place in a vehicle traveling between Cambria and Somerset counties, and she later found the victim and took photos of her injuries. Thomas was accused earlier of having attacked a woman in her Windber home in September. He faces sexual assault, aggravated indecent assault, unlawful restraint and strangulation charges in that case. Defense attorney Ryan Tutera earlier said Thomas maintains he is innocent of all of the charges. Thomas was elected in 2019 but suspended after charges in the sexual assault case were filed, and his pay was halted several months ago. A message seeking comment on the new charges was left Tuesday for his attorney.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The head of the state Division of Motor Vehicles won’t face criminal charges in connection with an alleged prostitution operation that leased his rental property, the state’s attorney general said Monday. Attorney General Peter Neronha said his review of the Rhode Island State Police investigation into DMV Administrator Walter “Bud” Craddock is complete. His office concluded the evidence does not show “beyond a reasonable doubt” that Craddock knew commercial sex activity was going on at his property in Cranston. When asked for comment from Craddock on Monday, a DMV spokesperson directed questions to the governor’s office. The governor’s office is referring the matter to the state’s human resources department and said that “two highly-respected organizations” have done a thorough review and “concluded there was no criminal activity or evidence of wrongdoing against Craddock,” who has said he had no knowledge of any illegal activities at the site and had never heard any complaints. Rhode Island’s Republican Party said Craddock should still be fired from his job. “Although there may not be enough evidence to charge Craddock with a crime, there is certainly enough evidence to show that Craddock had bad judgment,” the party said in a statement Monday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Mark Meadows – a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump who was removed earlier this month from voter rolls in North Carolina, which he once represented in Congress – is still a registered voter in South Carolina and another state, according to officials and a published report. Chris Whitmire, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Elections Commission, told the Associated Press the Republican former lawmaker and his wife registered as voters in the state in March 2022. “That’s when he became active,” Whitmire said, noting that neither Meadows had yet cast a vote in the state. “From our perspective, it just looks like any new South Carolina voter.” The South Carolina registration was first reported by The Washington Post, which noted that Meadows had been a registered voter simultaneously in three states – the Carolinas and Virginia – until North Carolina removed him from its rolls. Meadows remains a registered Virginia voter, the paper reports. Mark and Debra Meadows bought a home on picturesque Lake Keowee for $1.6 million in July, according to records for the property, which was listed on their South Carolina voter registration records.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state Senate on Tuesday approved the rules for an impeachment trial of the state’s attorney general for his conduct surrounding a 2020 fatal car crash, laying out a two-day proceeding in June that gives just hours to either side to argue their case. Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg, a Republican, was impeached by the House this month over the crash in which he killed a pedestrian but initially said he may have struck a deer or other large animal. The Senate trial, which will decide whether he is guilty of the House impeachment charges, is historic since Ravnsborg is the first official to be impeached in South Dakota. The trial’s rules received unanimous approval in the Republican-controlled Senate. They give both the impeachment prosecutors and Ravnsborg’s defense attorney one hour for an opening statement, four hours to present evidence and one hour to close their arguments. Senators may take additional time to ask additional questions, debate the articles of impeachment and hear directly from Ravnsborg if he chooses to testify. The trial starts June 21. “These rules were designed to be a very simple and fair process,” said Republican Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, who presides over the Senate. He added that the files used in the impeachment investigation will be posted online and that he expects senators to review those before the trial.\n\nTennessee\n\nFranklin: Two years after voting to remove the Confederate flag from its seal, Williamson County finally has the go-ahead to do so. The Williamson County Commission voted in 2020 to request permission from the Tennessee Historical Commission to remove the flag from the upper-left quadrant of its 1960s-era seal. That decision came after months of discussion and the appointment of a task force that unanimously recommended removal. The county had to go through the Historical Commission because the Tennessee Heritage Protection Act limits the removal or changing of historical memorials. On Friday, the county shifted tactics, asking the Historical Commission to declare that the law does not apply to the seal. “Williamson County now brings this petition for a declaratory order asking the Tennessee Historical Commission to hold that … the seal is not a ‘memorial’ as defined in the act,” County Attorney Jeff Moseley wrote in the petition. Even if it was a memorial, the petition continued, “it was not erected for, named, or dedicated on public property in honor of any historic conflict, historic entity, historic event, historic figure or historic organization.” The Historical Commission unanimously accepted the county’s argument.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The world’s largest international dark sky reserve opened this month through a collaboration of entities that focus on environmental concerns and astronomy in West Texas, including the University of Texas’ McDonald Observatory, The Daily Texan reports. The new reserve, called the Greater Big Bend International Dark Sky Reserve, stretches over 9 million acres and spans from Fort Davis to the Chihuahuan Desert, according to the International Dark-Sky Association. Stephen Hummel, dark sky initiative coordinator at the McDonald Observatory, said in addition to its uses in astronomy research, the reserve will protect and support wildlife. “We’ve been doing dark sky advocacy for a long time,” Hummel said. “Most of that, at least initially, was centered around protecting astronomical research, but over the decades, as the body of science has grown, we’re realizing it’s about so much more than astronomy. … Light pollution (poses) a threat to our environment.” Numerous organizations such as the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit that works to address climate change and biodiversity loss, contributed to the dark sky reserve’s creation.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: In a national report on air quality pollution levels, southwest Utah earned the distinction of having some of the cleanest air in the country. Both Iron and Washington counties ranked as having high-quality air, according to the report, “State of the Air,” produced by the American Lung Association. The report measured pollution levels for both particle and ozone pollution over a three-year period from 2018 to 2020. St. George was one of the cleanest cities when it came to short-term particle pollution and ranked eighth in clean cities in the nation for year-round particle pollution, which is “a mixture of tiny bits of solids and liquids in the air we breathe,” according to the report. Factories, power plants, fires, diesel and gas-powered vehicles emit these polluting particles into the air. But while St. George ranked high for its quality in particle pollution, the city and surrounding area – Washington County – received a C grade for ozone pollution levels, with four days annually falling into the “orange” category of pollution. On an “orange” day, the air quality levels are unhealthy for sensitive groups, which include people diagnosed with heart or lung diseases, people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and anyone who is pregnant, according to the ALA.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city says construction could begin this summer on a road project that has been in the planning stages for decades. The Burlington City Council on Monday unanimously approved a construction contract for the $45 million Champlain Parkway. The project is designed to improve traffic circulation, alleviate overburdened roadways, protect Lake Champlain through enhanced storm water management, and improve vehicular, bike and pedestrian safety. The office of Mayor Miro Weinberger says the federal government will pay 95% of the cost, the state 3% and the city 2%. The Champlain Parkway will be a two-lane road that is designed to eventually connect Interstate 189 with with downtown Burlington, but the initial construction phase will not connect to the interstate. Weinberger’s office said the construction schedule will allow the mayor’s office and the City Council “to work with the public in the future to determine when our community is ready for the second phase of the project that will make the interstate connection.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s attorney general has launched an inquiry into the Washington Commanders following allegations of financial improprieties raised by a congressional committee. Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican, disclosed his office’s investigation in a letter to a team lawyer Monday, saying he viewed it as his “responsibility to carefully examine the material facts regarding this matter.” “To be clear, I have not prejudged the issues raised regarding the Commanders,” he wrote. The announcement from Miyares comes about two weeks after the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote to the Federal Trade Commission saying it found evidence of deceptive business practices over the span of more than a decade, including withholding ticket revenue from visiting teams and refundable deposits from fans. The Commanders denied the allegations in a letter to the FTC. “The team categorically denies any suggestion of financial impropriety of any kind at any time. We adhere to strict internal processes that are consistent with industry and accounting standards, are audited annually by a globally respected independent auditing firm, and are also subject to regular audits by the NFL. We continue to cooperate fully with the Committee’s work,” the team said in a statement Monday.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: After efforts to restrict the use of natural gas in future commercial building heating systems stalled in the Legislature, the state’s Building Code Council adopted revisions to Washington’s energy code that require new businesses and apartments to mostly use heat pumps to warm air and water starting next year. The Spokesman-Review reports the council approved the changes on an 11-3 vote Friday. The new rules take effect July 1, 2023. Under the revised code, new commercial buildings would have to use heat pumps for space heating. The plan would effectively ban HVAC systems that use fossil fuels like natural gas – including most standard furnaces – or systems that use electric resistance, such as baseboard heaters, wall heaters, radiant heat systems and electric furnaces. Certain exceptions allow electric resistance to be used in specific situations as approved by a code official, and some exceptions also would be allowed for space heating using a fossil fuel. For water heating, 50% of water must be warmed by a heat pump system, while the rest can be heated by an additional source like electric resistance or fossil fuels.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: People having problems with mental health or suicidal thoughts will soon be able to find help by calling just three numbers – 988. The state Department of Health and Human Resources has received a federal grant to change over to the three-digit system July 16, WCHS-TV reports. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline call center based in Charleston is operated by First Choice Services and answers West Virginia calls to the lifeline. Callers can reach help now at (800) 273-TALK (8255), before the change in July. “Coming in July, that number is going to be even more accessible,” said Sheila Moran, communications and marketing director for First Choice Services. “People will be able to dial simply 988 to reach someone 24 hours a day. So anyone who is feeling suicidal, or any kind of mental health crisis, can call that line.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nBrookfield: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos is extending the taxpayer-funded contract of the former state Supreme Court justice leading a review of the 2020 election – a decision announced a day after ex-President Donald Trump sought to intimidate Vos by threatening a successful primary challenge if the review did not continue. In a statement Monday that did not name Vos directly, Trump suggested in a statement to his millions of supporters that the Rochester Republican will see a successful primary opponent if he does not extend former Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman’s contract with the Assembly. “Anyone calling themselves a Republican in Wisconsin should support the continued investigation in Wisconsin without interference,” Trump said. On Tuesday, Vos issued a statement announcing Gableman’s office will remain open “as we guarantee the legal power of our legislative subpoenas and get through the other lawsuits that have gridlocked this investigation.” Vos hired Gableman to look into the last presidential election in June 2021, just hours after Trump blasted a statement to his supporters criticizing Vos and other Republican legislative leaders for not doing more to litigate his 2020 election loss. Vos gave Gableman a $676,000 taxpayer-funded budget, which includes an $11,000 monthly salary. Since the review launched, Gableman has missed multiple deadlines to issue a final report.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s third through eighth graders saw a minimized loss in standardized testing scores as the pandemic disrupted classrooms, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming students were the least likely in the nation to be pushed out of in-person learning as COVID-19 began gripping the nation, according to the paper, which cited research from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Brown University and MIT that showed less of a decline in scores in the Equality State than any other.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/07/17/has-twitters-cancel-culture-gone-too-far/5445804002/", "title": "Twitter's cancel culture: A force for good or a digital witchhunt? The ...", "text": "The latest celebrity to enter the social discourse surrounding online cancellation: Nick Cannon.\n\nThe comedian’s name trended on Twitter on July 15 after he was fired by ViacomCBS over “hateful speech.” The news added fuel to the debate over whether holding celebrities accountable for their opinions has gone too far.\n\nSome argued that the host of \"Wild 'n Out,\" which airs on VH1 and MTV, should be “canceled,” which often entails boycotting a famous person’s work. Others asked: “What happened to freedom of speech?”\n\nTwitter has become a powerful court of public opinion and \"cancel culture\" plays a role. The phenomenon occurs when people get upset about something that a company or person has done or something they have said. It also can be divisive with opposers saying threats of cancellation stifles free speech.\n\nIt's hard to deny that cancel culture has sparked important conversations and change, such as when #Oscarssowhite trended for the first time. Since then, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has made efforts to diversify its ranks. Twitter also helped elevate the complaints and charges of sexual assault, sexism and unfair treatment of women during the #MeToo movement.\n\nBut the strength of cancel culture can also ravage careers and lives. And there are cases where the people on Twitter don't have all the facts and perhaps took on the role of judge and jury without having an accurate picture of the story behind their ire.\n\nGetting \"canceled\" can mean being removed in many ways. In recent weeks, episodes of \"Live PD\" and \"Cops\" were pulled from the air after George Floyd's death sparked questions surrounding misleading police story lines. Last year, comedian Shane Gillis was fired from \"Saturday Night Live\" after people unearthed old, offensive comments. Others have faced a similar fate.\n\nBut has the backlash gone too far? The answer isn't clear cut, experts say.\n\n“Society is still grappling with what’s considered ‘too far’ on the internet,” said Anne Charity Hudley, the chair of linguistics of African America at the University of California. “Something that can be used for good can also be weaponized. Everything can go too far; even free speech can go too far.”\n\n'Keep this energy up':Black-owned businesses see surge of interest amid racism protests\n\nGoya products boycott\n\nThe internet recently came down hard on Goya Foods after its CEO praised President Donald Trump. People vowed not to support the brand, and the now embattled chief executive called the backlash “suppression of speech.” Others who faced \"cancellation\" include Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute from \"Vanderpump Rules\" and YouTube influencer James Charles.\n\nIn Cannon’s case, the comedian said on Facebook that he was an \"advocate for people's voices to be heard openly, fairly and candidly.\" The post came after ViacomCBS severed ties with the entertainer over an episode of his podcast “Cannon's Class”, where he “promoted hateful speech and spread anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.”\n\nThe cancel culture debate hit a high point this month when Harper’s Magazine published a letter proposing that successful writers and editors felt stifled by a growing public intolerance.\n\nOn the flip side, professionals who specialize in social movements say cancel culture was birthed from groups of people growing tired of others abusing power by controlling the narrative of marginalized communities.\n\n“People have learned over time, and over decades, that sometimes you have to make a little bit of noise on social media in order for people to be held accountable,” said Apryl Alexander, professor of psychology at the University of Denver.\n\nIt’s easy for the cancel culture movement to get wound into a game of false equivalence, with some people calling for justice while others worry about expressing themselves, experts said.\n\n\"Yes, there is freedom of speech and people should be allowed to voice their opinions,\" Alexander said. \"But when they use that voice and it's causing harm, we do need to address the harm.\"\n\nSome of the people who have been on the receiving end of cancellation were charged or convicted of crimes, such as rape and sexual assault, as in the Harvey Weinstein case.\n\nToo big to cancel?\n\nDespite disturbing revelations, sometimes people aren’t ready to let go of their idols.\n\n\"Tonight Show\" host Jimmy Fallon was at the epicenter of digital backlash in March after old photos of him wearing Blackface surfaced. It wasn’t his first racial indiscretion, yet the show remains on the air. Old racist tweets from songstress Camila Cabello surfaced in 2019. As of June, she’s still the face of L'Oreal in commercials. Both issued a public apology.\n\n“That’s one of the most concerning parts, many of these individuals go on living their lives without being truly canceled or held accountable for the things they did or said,” Alexander said.\n\nShort attention spans allow many people to avoid long-term cancellation, experts say. Today’s headline is often forgotten when something scandalous comes out tomorrow. Also, calls to cancel someone can be made by anyone, including people who never supported the entertainer in the first place.\n\nGetting doxed\n\nCancel culture is tethered to other social media occurrences that can cause real harm.\n\nSometimes, when people voice controversial opinions online, they get doxed, or have their private information researched and posted, by a digital vigilante. There are instances where the wrong person’s information was shared, and others where the content was misinterpreted.\n\nIn one case in May, a Santa Monica woman said in an opinion piece published by USA TODAY that her life was threatened by a “social media mob” that misunderstood what was really happening in a 34-second clip. The video showed her holding a power drill in Santa Monica, California, after uprisings there. People on the internet alleged she was posing for an Instagram photo, but in real life, she says she was joking with local volunteer workers.\n\nThere are also elements of cyberbullying that can happen when people are “called out” for their behavior.\n\n\"Cyberbullying is a negative outcome, but it can come from both cancel culture and people trying to oppress others,\" said Alexander of the University of California.\n\nBut it can lead to change, too\n\nCancellation, in most cases, isn't permanent. But widespread calls to boycott or call out people, companies and institutions have led to change that many view as positive.\n\nThink back to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy. When activist April Reign sparked the hashtag in 2015, the nominees for the prestigious acting awards visibly lacked diversity. The Academy responded to the outcry by setting inclusion goals, and in 2020 announced that it had more than doubled the number of minority members since 2016.\n\nAnd social media-spun uprisings have contributed to the calls for racial justice in America. When people online point out the issues and provide video proof online, it has led to people being arrested and, sometimes convicted, of crimes or changes to policy.\n\n\"Social media has allowed people to organize more comprehensively and react more quickly,\" Alexander said. \"Changes are happening in terms of police departments, universities and schools looking at their anti-blackness policies. Now, how do we sustain it? That's the next big question.\"\n\nFollow Dalvin Brown on Twitter: @Dalvin_Brown.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/11/27/subway-thanksgiving-high-horse-gift-wrap-wars-news-around-states/40714889/", "title": "A subway Thanksgiving, too-high horse: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A new statue of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks will be unveiled at Court Square downtown Sunday at 1 p.m. The unveiling Dec. 1 will coincide with the day in 1955 when Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a public bus to a white man. Along with the Parks memorial, the city will present two historic markers for Browder v. Gayle – the landmark case that ruled segregation on Montgomery buses unconstitutional. The civil rights memorials are a partnership among the City of Montgomery, Montgomery County, the Alabama Department of Tourism and the Montgomery Area Business Committee for the Arts.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal agency will decide by September how much ocean and coast will be designated as critical habitat for two ice seal species found in the state. The Center for Biological Diversity announced Monday that it had reached an agreement with the Commerce Department for the Trump administration to issue a critical habitat rule for ringed and bearded seals. Ringed and bearded seals live off Alaska’s northwest coast. Both are listed as threatened. Designation of critical habitat for threatened species is required by the Endangered Species Act a year after a listing. The Center for Biological Diversity sued in June because no critical habitat has been designated. Federal agencies that authorize activities such as oil drilling within critical habitat must consult with wildlife managers to determine if threatened species will be affected.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: For many elementary students, this time of year is filled with lessons about Thanksgiving, often arts and crafts or plays about the Pilgrims. That’s not the case for students at schools like Salt River Elementary and Puente de Hozho. Instead, these students get lessons that give insight into and strengthen their identity as indigenous people, focusing on fall harvest traditions and the importance of giving thanks. Teaching the myth of Thanksgiving is not required in the state’s standards for history and social studies. Salt River Elementary is a Bureau of Indian Education school located on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, and 100% of the student body is Native American. The school incorporates cultural and traditional learning within its curriculum. During November, many teachers increase those lessons for Native American Heritage Month. As for Thanksgiving, “we only talk about being thankful and being with family,” says Clarice Garcia, a fifth grade teacher. In the weeks leading up to the holiday, Garcia said she tries to talk about the positive and negative impacts explorers had on indigenous people, letting students form their own opinion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The University of Arkansas is now the home of a photo archive containing nearly a million photos of historical figures and events. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the collection arrived at the campus in Fayetteville last month. The archive includes photos of Babe Ruth, Bonnie Parker, Winston Churchill and Martin Luther King. There are also pictures documenting politics, wars, natural disasters and the civil rights movement. Dean of libraries Dennis T. Clark says the large trove is very significant in American journalism. He says it is the New York Post’s photo archive, which contains photos dating back to the 1860s. Lori Birrell, head of the special collections department at the UA library, says the collection will show the university is interested in having a national and international presence. Clark says the gift came from an anonymous donor in 2017.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo Safari Park has a pair of quirky new arrivals from Australia: platypuses. Last week the zoo publicly debuted an 8-year-old male named Birrarung and a 15-year-old female named Eve. The pair were flown to the park late last month. The zoo says it’s the first time in more than 50 years that platypuses – egg-laying mammals with furry bodies and ducklike bills – have been cared for outside of Australia. Safari Park’s lead keeper, Lori Hieber, says the pair have settled into their new, specially built habitat. She says they swim in the pools, play in the waterfalls and hunt live crayfish. An international conservation group lists the platypus as a “near threatened” species, mainly from habitat loss and the potential destruction from climate change.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court has denied a request to reconsider a ruling declaring the sentences of hundreds of criminal defendants to be illegal. The Denver Post reports the justices refused to rethink whether criminal offenders could be sentenced to both prison and probation in the same case. Officials say the court ruled in September that defendants couldn’t be simultaneously sentenced. Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a petition this month challenging the decision, saying it could create extensive litigation affecting hundreds or even thousands of plea agreements and leading to numerous challenges. Officials say defendants convicted by a jury must be resentenced. Authorities say witnesses might have moved away, police investigators might have retired, and victims might not want to testify again, causing problems in the process.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state will soon host its second inauguration of 2019. On Monday, West Hartford fifth grader Myra Stanfield will become the 2020 Kid Governor, succeeding 2019’s Ella Briggs. A ceremony is planned at the Old State House in Hartford. Like Ella, Myra was elected to the one-year position by fifth graders across Connecticut. She ran on a platform of preventing animal abuse. Her term begins in January. The civics education program was created in 2015 by the Connecticut Public Affairs Network, now known as the Connecticut Democracy Center. Participating students are given an opportunity to create a campaign platform around an issue, run for office and vote in the election. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose inauguration was 11 months ago, released a video online congratulating Myra.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The Delaware Department of Insurance is warning residents about a new Medicare tool that state officials say causes confusion and conceals the total cost of coverage. In what he described as a rare consumer alert, Commissioner Trinidad Navarro said in a press release that the department has received numerous complaints about Medicare’s Prescription Plan Finder. The tool, created by the federal government and used by millions, is supposed to help find and compare Medicare coverage options for the current enrollment period, which ends Dec. 7. Navarro said the tool’s “focus on premium costs can deflect focus from higher personal costs at the pharmacy counter.” The tool organizes responses, Navarro said, by showing lowest premium costs first. But previous versions of the tool showed it by total annual costs. And if residents enter multiple medications, they could receive search results for plans that don’t cover all those they entered, according to the release.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district is joining several states in suing e-cigarette maker Juul Labs, saying the company’s online ads and promotions illegally targeted minors. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine announced the lawsuit Tuesday, alleging that Juul’s viral marketing contributed to the surge in underage vaping by teens in the district and across the U.S. The move follows similar lawsuits filed by California, New York and North Carolina. Several other states are also investigating Juul, which dominates the U.S. vaping market. Under intense pressure, Juul has suspended its U.S. advertising and halted sales of all but two of its flavors. Additionally, the company closed its social media accounts and tightened age verification for online sales. Representatives for Juul did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: The local school district is bringing in a crack squad of four-legged experts to deal with an overgrown patch of rough terrain, where hidden gopher tortoises, snakes, steep banks and vertical drop-offs make it too hazardous for grounds crews to handle. About two dozen goats will descend into a fenced area around a pond next to Imperial Estates Elementary in Titusville next week. Grounds services supervisor Matt Nolle says the area is too dangerous for heavy equipment or even people on foot. Goats are better for the environment and can get into places humans can’t. “Somehow, four legs is an advantage,” Nolle says. The Brevard School District is paying about $4,500 to hire the goats from Rent-a-Ruminant, a landscaping livestock company.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Georgia Southern University has officially opened a learning center in Ireland. Savannah Morning News reports university leaders traveled to Wexford last week for the ceremonial event. A news release from the university says the center stems from a longtime partnership between the town and Savannah, as well as Georgia Southern’s Center for Irish Research and Teaching. The school says many Savannah residents claim Irish ancestry and can trace ancestors specifically to Wexford. University President Kyle Marrero met Ireland’s President Michael D. Higgins during the visit. The school says it marked the first official meeting between a Georgia Southern president and a foreign head of state. The school says Georgia Southern is the first public university in the United States to open an outreach learning facility in Ireland.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state Department of Education plans to offer free Hawaiian language courses to its employees. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the department’s 22,000 salaried employees, including 13,000 teachers, will be able to take courses beginning in January. Officials say the program is a partnership between the education department’s Office of Hawaiian Education and the University of Hawaii’s community colleges. The education department has incorporated Hawaiian language, culture and history in its curriculum since an 80-year public education ban on the language was overturned at the 1978 state constitutional convention. Employees can enroll in scheduled courses at seven community colleges beginning in the spring semester or join customized courses for education department staff groups. Teachers completing courses will receive professional development credits, while other employees will be given college credit.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Fisheries managers are optimistic a program to save imperiled Snake River sockeye salmon is heading in the right direction despite few of the ocean-going fish making it back to central Idaho this year. Of the 735,000 young sockeye released in the state in 2017, only 17 survived the 900-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean and then back again to arrive as adults in the Sawtooth Basin near Stanley. But John Powell of the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said last week that fish raised to adults in hatcheries will keep the population going. Biologists also released 610 adults this fall into central Idaho lakes to spawn naturally. Powell also says biologists have solved problems that caused most of the young hatchery sockeye to die shortly after being released into the wild in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: There are full slates of special events and celebrations scheduled for the holiday season at two state historic sites in the city. Santa will be available regularly at the Old State Capitol to collect children’s Christmas wishes, and specially themed tours are scheduled for the Dana-Thomas House designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Children and families may visit with St. Nick and play holiday games at the Old State Capitol from 1 to 5 p.m. each Saturday from Nov. 30 to Dec. 21 and from 5 to 8 p.m. each Wednesday from Dec. 4 to 18. Each day will feature a different musical group as well. A dozen variously themed tours of the Dana-Thomas House are scheduled periodically from Nov. 29 through Dec. 20. Some require reservations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is facing calls from Democrats to explain his role in Amazon being cleared of responsibility for a warehouse worker’s death despite initial findings of major safety violations. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb denies any involvement in the state’s investigation of the 2017 death at Amazon’s Plainfield warehouse. The news outlet Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting reports a safety inspector ordered a $28,000 fine against Amazon, concluding it didn’t provide enough training before a forklift fatally crushed 59-year-old Phillip Lee Terry. It cites a recording the inspector made in which his boss tells Amazon officials how to shift the blame to “employee misconduct.” The death investigation happened while the Holcomb administration was bidding on Amazon’s planned second headquarters project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds has pardoned two tom turkeys, continuing a long-standing Thanksgiving tradition celebrating the state’s turkey industry. The male birds named Benjamin and Franklin will live at Living History Farms in Urbandale, a 500-acre, open-air history museum that demonstrates three centuries of Iowa farm life. Reynolds held the annual event Tuesday at Terrace Hill, the governor’s residence, where she says she’ll spend Thanksgiving cooking for her family. Several family members, including grandchildren, petted the turkeys after Reynolds read the proclamation freeing them from becoming a thanksgiving meal. Iowa ranks seventh in U.S. turkey production, turning out more than 12 million turkeys annually on 130 farms. The state is fifth in turkey processing with plants in Storm Lake and West Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly reveled in holiday spirit Tuesday for the annual horse-drawn delivery of a Christmas tree to Cedar Crest, the official governor’s residence. The first-year governor said for years she has watched the celebration on the news with the rest of the state, and it was a “treat” to preside over the event. Every year, a member of the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association donates a tree for the occasion. Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm near Lawrence donated this year’s model. Robin Dunn, of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville, guided percherons Bill and Bruce as they pulled a replica Wells Fargo stagecoach up the drive to the front of the governor’s mansion to deliver the tree. Dunn said she has now delivered trees to five Kansas governors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The state’s politicos are getting all wrapped up in the Christmas wars this year. After the reelection campaign for Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., began selling gift wrap featuring the Senate majority leader’s face with a Santa hat and a green bow tie – reminiscent of an iconic image of Christmas crooner Bing Crosby – the Kentucky Democratic Party has shot back with its own bespoke present paper. A donation of $30 to the commonwealth’s blue party yields a roll of red “Moscow Mitch” wrapping paper, featuring yellow images of the Republican wearing a Cossack hat with the “hammer and sickle” symbol on top of the words “Just Say Nyet to Moscow Mitch,” referring to a nickname McConnell received over the summer. “Anything @Team_Mitch can do, we can do better,” the Kentucky Democratic Party wrote in a tweet.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state museum system is asking for feedback as it works to update its governance, operations and attendance at its properties. The museum system wants people to fill out a five- to 10-minute survey about their interest in the facilities and their experiences at them. The survey will be available online until Saturday. The Louisiana state museum system includes the Cabildo and the Presbytere in New Orleans, the New Orleans Jazz Museum, the Capitol Park Museum in Baton Rouge and the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in Natchitoches, among other facilities. Survey participants can enter to win a membership through the Friends of the Cabildo that gives free admission for two people and any children to all public state museum properties.\n\nMaine\n\nBucksport: Officials say a new partnership with the state’s farmers markets has expanded the number of people who can use the markets by making food assistance easier to access. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry says it has partnered with the Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets to help pay for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program processing equipment. The technology can cost hundreds of dollars, which prices many small markets out of the ability to buy it. About 1 in 8 Maine residents uses SNAP. The state says a half-dozen farmers markets have received new SNAP processing gear through the partnership since July. Maine has a total of about 35 farmers markets that accept SNAP.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island National Seashore: The National Park Service will institute a modest increase for all parks that charge entrance fees next year, including on Assateague Island. Effective Jan. 1, 2020, entrance fees at Assateague Island National Seashore will be modified to align with standardized rates being implemented nationwide for similar national park areas at the rate of an extra $5 per category. A seven-day pass to the park will be $25 per vehicle or $20 per motorcycle. An annual park pass will cost $45, and individuals will be charged $15 per person when entering by commercial vehicle. An entrance pass provides seven consecutive days of access to the seashore and the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge in Virginia. The additional funds will be used for infrastructure and maintenance needs to enhance the visitor experience.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Native Americans are gathering for a 50th year in the seaside town where the Pilgrims settled – not to give thanks but to grieve. United American Indians of New England held its first National Day of Mourning in 1970. Since then, tribes have assembled at noon every Thanksgiving Day on a windswept hill overlooking Plymouth Rock. On Thursday, they’ll recall what organizers describe as “the genocide of millions of native people, the theft of native lands and the relentless assault on native culture.” That’s an in-your-feast message, but co-leader Mahtowin Munro says the group is determined to get Americans to look beyond the Thanksgiving myth of European settlers and native people coexisting peacefully. Next year, Plymouth marks the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing in 1620.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: Leaders with Flint Community Schools are considering closing four of the district’s 12 school buildings amid a $5.7 million budget deficit partly driven by rising special education costs not covered by the state. Superintendent Derrick Lopez presented the proposal at a special school board meeting last week. It also calls for the restructuring four other district buildings. The plan would decrease transportation, security, maintenance, administrative and other expenses. Lopez says the district’s special education student number has greatly risen from just under 15% in the 2014-15 school year, as Flint’s water crisis began, to now 24%. Flint’s water was lead-contaminated when officials used corrosive river water from April 2014 to October 2015. In children, lead exposure can result in serious effects on IQ, ability to focus and academic achievement.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State officials have warned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that a proposal to streamline water quality laws would cripple their authority to protect drinking water, streams and wildlife from dozens of new projects each year. The EPA’s proposal targets Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which allows states to set their own conditions, conduct reviews, and approve or deny projects that could potentially pollute waterways. The change would give federal authorities power to dismiss conditions set by states or tribes and allow the EPA to overrule a state’s project denial. It would also prevent states from studying indirect sources of water pollution. But the Star Tribune reports that a Minnesota Chamber of Commerce official says some businesses welcome the changes. The EPA says states use their authority to impose conditions not related to water quality.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Magnolia State residents don’t have to leave the state to buy lottery tickets anymore. Tickets went on sale Monday at roughly 1,200 convenience stores and other sites. The Mississippi Lottery Corporation says people bought a total of $2.5 million in lottery tickets on the first day of sales, which translates into $570,000 for the state. Democratic state Rep. Alyce Clarke of Jackson has been pushing for years to bring a lottery to Mississippi. She bought a ceremonial first ticket at a RaceWay store and gas station in south Jackson. “It feels great. Finally, it becomes a reality. And it just goes to show you what happens if you don’t give up,” Clarke said. For decades Mississippi was one of only six states without a lottery amid strong opposition from politically powerful churches. People often drove to neighboring states such as Louisiana to buy tickets there.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Comedian Heidi Gardner is flipping the switch on an annual holiday lighting ceremony at the upscale Country Club Plaza shopping and dining district. The “Saturday Night Light” cast member says getting the starring role at the Thanksgiving night event once seemed “crazy” and “out of reach.” The Kansas City native was working on the Plaza in 1998 when actor Paul Rudd did the honors, lighting up several blocks of buildings. And she told The Kansas City Star that she has long had a picture of the Plaza lights on her refrigerator. The ceremony dates back to the 1930s. The only time the Plaza lights were not in operation occurred in 1973, when President Richard Nixon called upon all Americans to curtail the use of Christmas lights to reduce dependence on foreign oil imports.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: The Board of Regents has approved a $150,000 pay raise to retain Waded Cruzado as the president of Montana State University after she received an offer for a higher-paying job. Supporters say Cruzado’s vision and fundraising ability make her worth the $476,000 annual salary, while opponents note her raise is nearly three times the median household income in the state. Commissioner of Higher Education Clay Christian supported the raise, saying it would allow Cruzado to continue the momentum she has created on the Bozeman campus. The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports two classified MSU employees noted some workers are paid less than $11 an hour, vacancies are hard to fill, and people have left because they can’t afford to live in Bozeman. Regents on Friday also approved a 2% or 50-cent-per-hour raise for university system employees, whichever is greater.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is temporarily lifting weight restrictions on trucks carrying propane to address a shortage of heating fuels. State officials have suspended the 90,000-pound gross weight limit for motor carriers hauling critically needed heating fuels through Dec. 15. Lt. Gov. Mike Foley issued the order last week on behalf of Gov. Pete Ricketts, who is out of the state. Officials say drivers exceeding the normal weight limits must carry a copy of the executive order to document that they are providing direct support to the state. The order doesn’t apply to the interstate system. State officials say the shortage isn’t serious, but they’re monitoring it. They say more extreme shortages in surrounding states have increased the need to transport through Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A multibillion-dollar megaresort taking shape on the north end of the Strip is on track to become the most expensive hotel-casino project ever built. Malaysia-based Genting Group says the company’s Resorts World Las Vegas is expected to open in the summer of 2021. The cost of the project, initially targeted for a 2016 opening on the former site of the Stardust, was last estimated at $4 billion. Now it sits at $4.3 billion. That would make Resorts World Las Vegas more expensive than the development of the $4 billion Cosmopolitan. With the inflated price tag comes new features, according to the company, including a 5,000-capacity “state-of-the-art theater” scalable to host A-list residencies and corporate events; a 75,000-square-foot “nightlife and daylife concept”; and a 50-foot-diameter video globe to display over 6,000 square feet of LED content.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nMerrimack: Gov. Chris Sununu’s advisory board has voted to eliminate tolls on one of the state’s heavily traveled highways. The Executive Council voted Monday to get rid of the Merrimack tolls at the Everett Turnpike. The highway links Massachusetts and the New Hampshire cities of Manchester and Concord. Drivers currently pay 50 cents on the on and off ramps at the exits. The tolls bring in more than $1 million each year, but a transportation commission has decided that it puts Merrimack residents under an unfair burden. The tollbooths that were built 30 years ago will remain, but starting Jan. 1, motorists will be allowed to drive through without paying a toll.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Officials are hoping the return of redesigned holiday decorations will keep the season bright for commuters who travel through the Holland Tunnel. A slightly larger Christmas tree than the one used last year will be placed to cover the letter “A,” and a wreath will cover the letter “O.” A menorah will be positioned adjacent to the toll plaza on the New Jersey side of the tunnel. After complaints that the decades-old decorations over the New York-bound tunnel were distracting, more than 21,000 people last year voted in a poll commissioned by tunnel operator the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Voters wanted the tree moved from over the “N” in “Holland” to cover the “A” and the wreath moved from over the “U.” The decorations go up Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCimarron: One of the most spectacular properties owned by the Boy Scouts of America is being mortgaged to help secure the youth organization’s line of credit. The Boy Scouts say there is no plan to sell the Philmont Scout Ranch in Colfax County. It is being used as collateral to help meet financial needs that include rising insurance costs related to sex-abuse litigation. The move dismayed a member of Philmont’s oversight committee, who says it violates agreements made when the land was donated in 1938. The BSA disputed his assertion. The mortgage document was signed by top Boy Scout officials in March. But members of the Philmont Ranch Committee only recently learned of the development. The ranch is a popular destination for hiking and camping trips.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Thanksgiving came early for a group of New York City commuters who enjoyed a holiday feast on a subway train. Video footage shows riders standing behind a white-clothed table covered with plates of turkey, mashed potatoes and cornbread in the middle of a Brooklyn-bound L train on Sunday. Stand-up comedian Jodell “Joe Show” Lewis tells the New York Post he organized the Thanksgiving dinner to “bring a little excitement to commuters” and feed any New Yorkers who might be hungry. Lewis says he chose the L train after he saw how “dreary and upset” riders were at the inconvenience of a construction project that has cut service on the line.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Students and employees at all University of North Carolina system campuses will be able to use their school identification cards for the state’s voter ID mandate starting in 2020. The State Board of Elections announced on Tuesday the approval of cards for students and employees at 12 of the 17 UNC schools. These IDs were rejected earlier this year because they didn’t meet standards set in a law implementing the photo ID requirement. The ID mandate was added to the state constitution in 2018. The General Assembly altered ID security rules last spring so schools with rejected cards could apply again for next year. The board says more than 150 types of photo ID are approved for use with the March primary. A driver’s license is the most common.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There will be a runoff election for a new state Supreme Court chief justice. None of the three justices running to lead the high court received the majority votes necessary on Monday to clinch the position. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jon Jensen were the top vote-getters, followed by Daniel Crothers. McEvers and Jensen are still in the running. The ballots were cast by the state’s 52 district court judges and each of the five justices on the high court. They will now recast their votes, to be tallied in early December. The chief justice position was left open after 86-year-old Chief Justice Gerald VandeWalle announced in September that he would not seek reappointment to the top post when his term expires at the end of the year.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city’s zoo has welcomed a new baby giraffe shortly after losing the 12-year-old male giraffe that sired him. The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden says 8-year-old Cece delivered the calf Saturday, and mom and baby are doing fine. Zoo officials say it’s too soon to determine the sex of the 6-foot-tall calf. The calf was the seventh sired by Kimba, who died earlier this month from complications following a surgical procedure on his hooves. The calf is the 17th giraffe born at the zoo. Giraffe populations in the wild are being affected by habitat loss, trophy hunting and illegal poaching, Zoo officials say up to 75% of calves in the wild die in their first few months of life, mainly due to predators.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A new study has found that nearly 500 older, low-income Oklahomans died prematurely because the state did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The Oklahoman reports that a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis estimates 476 state residents between the ages of 55 and 64 died prematurely from 2014 to 2017 because the state declined to expand eligibility for the federal health care program. The left-leaning think tank says they are among 15,600 such deaths that could have been avoided nationally if all states had expanded Medicaid. The Washington, D.C.-based group says its estimates are based on mortality data and records and data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Social Security Administration. Republican leaders in the state dismissed the study as irresponsible and reckless.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregonians are being called to take pictures of the coast this week, for science. Coastwatch volunteer coordinator Jesse Jones says photos of extra high tides happening through Thursday can help scientists learn how different communities will be affected by climate change. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports photographs taken by citizen scientists and assembled by the Oregon King Tides Project can show where the water might be when the oceans rise. The Oregon King Tides project wants pictures from all along the coast to help figure out how to plan for rising seas. In particular, they need photographs of beaches as well as familiar landmarks like jetties, bridges, buildings, roads, seawall, shorelines, beach infrastructure and estuaries. Jones notes that the most helpful beach pictures are taken facing north or south so that it’s clear how far in or out the tide has come. Participants can upload the images to the Oregon King Tides website or post them to social media with the hashtags #orkingtides and #kingtides.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nReading: The state overhauled its child sexual abuse laws Tuesday, more than a year after a grand jury report showed the cover-up of hundreds of cases of abuse in most of Pennsylvania’s Roman Catholic dioceses over the past seven decades. The central bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf gives future victims of child sex abuse more time to file lawsuits and ends time limits for police to file criminal charges. The grand jury report spurred several states to change their laws and other states to begin similar investigations. Wolf said the new laws will help repair “faults in our justice system that prevent frightened, abused children from seeking justice when they grow into courageous adults.” Wolf signed the bills at Muhlenberg High School in Reading, the home district of Democratic state Rep. Mark Rozzi, a champion of the legislation who has spoken publicly about being raped as a 13-year-old by a Roman Catholic priest.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The city is working with Brown University to create a digital map of one of the nation’s largest and most intact Colonial-era African burial grounds. The city wants a high-resolution map of God’s Little Acre to serve as the foundation for future site management and exploration. Doctoral students from the Ivy League university are working on the project. The Preservation Society of Newport County says the burial ground contains about 200 professionally carved headstones for enslaved and freed Africans from the 17th and 18th centuries, a time when African graves were typically left unmarked in the United States. City officials hope the map will be ready next summer so it can be made available to the public through a smartphone app and online. Tours currently rely on a printed map.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLoris: A farm animal with unbridled ambition has given new meaning to the phrase “get off your high horse.” Horry County Fire Rescue workers say they were called Sunday to a barn in Loris, where a horse somehow managed to leave its stall and climb into a hayloft. They had to bring in heavy equipment, and large-animal veterinarians helped sedate the horse before it was lowered to the ground on a makeshift platform. The horse has moved on to greener pastures, seemingly in good spirits in a grazing field. Rescue workers still haven’t figured out how the horse managed to climb a narrow set of stairs into the loft.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The last living worker who helped construct Mount Rushmore National Memorial has died. Donald “Nick” Clifford of Keystone, South Dakota, was 98. His wife, Carolyn Clifford, says he died Saturday at a hospice in Rapid City. At 17, Nick Clifford was the youngest worker hired to work at Mount Rushmore, in the state’s Black Hills. He operated a winch that carried workers up and down the mountain where the faces of Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln were carved, and he drilled holes for dynamite. The Rapid City Journal reports that Mount Rushmore sculptor Gutzon Borglum and his son, Lincoln, decided in 1938 to field a baseball team and hired Clifford, who already was a veteran pitcher and right fielder. Clifford worked on Mount Rushmore from 1938 to 1940, earning 55 cents an hour.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal officials are proposing removing the Nashville crayfish from the endangered species list. A news release from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says a review has found the crayfish populations are “healthy, stable and robust.” The 7-inch crustacean lives only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville. The last review of the crayfish by the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended listing the species as “threatened.” Tierra Curry says that would be a better option. The senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity says Nashville is developing rapidly, and giving the species threatened status would allow it some continued protection. The proposal for delisting was published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The agency will accept public comments through Jan. 27.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: An English teacher who was fired after tweeting that her high school was full of students who are in the country illegally has won an appeal to get her job back. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath ruled Monday that Carter-Riverside High School teacher Georgia Clark’s tweet was protected by the First Amendment. Clark can either receive back pay and employment benefits, or the Fort Worth Independent School District can pay her a year’s salary. District spokeswoman Barbara Griffith says Morath’s ruling was a technicality, and the district is exploring its options. Clark’s attorney didn’t respond for a comment. The district board voted in June to fire Clark. She told a district investigator that her tweet was meant only for President Donald Trump and that she didn’t realize her postings were public.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Two of the state’s small cities tested an alternative method of voting that allows people to rank candidates from first to last during recent municipal elections. The Daily Herald reports six cities had planned to test the ranked-choice voting system, but four backed out over concerns about how to explain how it works to voters. Vineyard and Payson were the municipalities that tried out a method that allows voters to rank candidates from first to last. If none of the candidates gets more than 50% of the first-place votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated. The process continues for several rounds until a candidate gets the majority of votes. Vineyard City Recorder Pamela Spencer says she only received a few calls from confused voters and considered it a success.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Four local high school journalists have won an award for their victory over censorship. Last year, the Burlington High students broke a story in their school newspaper about a school employee facing unprofessional conduct charges. The interim principal asked the students’ adviser to take it down. The article was removed, but students kept up links to it on social media, saying it was censored. Students talked to legal experts, and the newspaper cited its rights under the “New Voices” law that protects First Amendment rights of student journalists. Last week the students were awarded the Courage in Student Journalism Award, sponsored by the Student Press Law Center, the Center for Scholastic Journalism at Kent State University and the National Scholastic Press Association.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials are reminding Virginians it’s not too late to get their flu vaccine. The Department of Health encourages everyone older than 6 months to receive the vaccine. State health officials gathered last week for an event in Richmond to highlight the importance of the vaccine and get a flu shot themselves. Flu season normally begins in October. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says vaccination by the end of October is preferred, vaccination in November and beyond can be beneficial. Influenza activity usually peaks in January or later. The CDC warns the flu is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. The CDC also says vaccination has been shown to significantly reduce a child’s risk of dying from influenza.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council is proceeding with a new tax on Uber and Lyft rides pitched by Mayor Jenny Durkan to help pay for affordable housing and the delayed downtown streetcar and to give new support to ride-hailing drivers. The Seattle Times reports council members unanimously approved the 57-cent tax Monday. Durkan and the council have also promised to ensure Uber and Lyft drivers make Seattle’s $16 minimum wage starting next summer, but the city first plans to study driver pay. The new tax stops short of a more widespread tolling scheme some say is necessary to truly address congestion choking downtown streets. Durkan’s administration has explored the concept of congestion pricing, in which all drivers downtown would pay a toll. Uber and Lyft back that type of widespread charge and decried the new tax, claiming it could stymie ridership and hurt drivers. Durkan’s office projects the new tax will raise about $25 million a year.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It’s officially buck hunting season in the Mountain State. The annual buck firearms season kicked off this week and is expected to bring thousands of hunters to the state’s vast woodlands. Officials say starting the season toward the end of November increases the chances of hunting during snowfall, which makes it easier to spot and track deer. The season traditionally opens on the Monday before Thanksgiving. Hunters can harvest two deer on the same day, but only one can be an antlered buck. Anyone who wants an additional buck must buy a stamp from the state and have additional licensing. Gary Foster of the Division of Natural Resources says the state’s deer seasons help bring in hundreds of millions of dollars to the state’s economy. Buck firearms season ends Dec. 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic lawmakers want more diaper-changing stations in the state. State Reps. Jonathan Brostoff and David Crowley and state Sen. Chris Larson have introduced a bill that would require public and commercial buildings built or renovated after the bill becomes law to have diaper-changing stations in every restroom. Owners of commercial buildings with public restrooms would have to post signs identifying bathrooms with changing stations. Brostoff says he’s a new father, and he’s constantly struck by how few businesses have changing stations and how many place them only in women’s restrooms. Aides for Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald didn’t immediately respond to emails inquiring about Republican support for the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The family of a man who was shot and killed by police officers is suing the city and the Casper Police Department. Daniel Wolosin alleges in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court that police officials failed to properly train officers in de-escalation techniques and failed to enforce policies that would have prevented the death of 38-year-old David Wolosin. Authorities say Wolosin opened fire first in the May 2018 shootout after two officers were called to check on a report of a man allowing children to drive a car on a dirt lot. Officer Jacob Carlson was shot multiple times by Wolosin and nearly died. City attorney John Henley told the Casper Star-Tribune he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit. Prosecutors previously determined the officers’ actions were justified.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/12/06/rocky-mountain-dry-ashes-american-flags-tom-petty-degree-news-around-states/49487927/", "title": "Rocky Mountain dry, ashes of American flags: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDelta: The highest point in the state, Cheaha Mountain, will soon become a repository for the ashes of retired American flags. A vault called “Old Glory Lookout” has been added to Cheaha State Park in Delta and will be dedicated Tuesday, on the 80th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. The vault will hold the remains of old U.S. flags, which are supposed to be destroyed by fire. A statement from Alabama’s state park system said the container consists of a steel vault encased in quartzite that was cut by members of the Civil Conservation Corps, a New Deal program formed in the 1930s under then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The vault is on the eastern slope of a ridge near a public boardwalk. The project is a joint effort between an American Legion post in Atmore and the park, located about 80 miles east of Birmingham. Paul Chason, adjutant for the American Legion post, said military, veteran and civic organizations will be able to inter flag ashes at the site. “We believe it is the first of its kind in America,” he said. Flags that were retired and burned during a ceremony on the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, will be placed in the vault during the ceremony Tuesday.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Matanuska-Susitna Borough is suing the Alaska Redistricting Board over recently drawn legislative boundaries that it says dilutes the votes of its residents. The lawsuit – brought on behalf of the borough and Michael Brown, the borough manager – was filed Thursday, their attorney Stacey Stone said. The board finalized its maps Nov. 10, triggering a 30-day period in which challenges could be filed. The board was charged with rewriting Alaska’s political boundaries following the 2020 census. The lawsuit cites concerns with the degree to which the target population for House districts was exceeded in the region and says two shared districts, with Valdez and parts of the Denali Borough, ignore “logical, municipal, and natural boundaries.” Peter Torkelson, the board’s executive director, said the board “will review any legal challenges with our counsel and then respond through the court system as contemplated by the Alaska Constitution.” A plan proposed by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough included four full House and two shared House districts. It did not seek to be paired with Valdez in one of the shared districts. Officials with the borough and Valdez argued against such a pairing.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A high school principal will not be back next year after a firestorm over a summer book assignment. The Paradise Valley Unified School District governing board voted Thursday not to renew the contract of Linda Ihnat, principal at Horizon High School. Ihnat failed to follow procedure when it came to informing parents about sensitive content in a book, according to board members. The book, “So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed” by Jon Ronson, was an option on an Advanced Placement English reading list last summer. The book examines victims of social media mobs and so-called cancel culture. Controversy erupted last month after some parents became aware of sexual content in the book, including references to orgies and bestiality. Ihnat was put on leave. Superintendent Troy Bales issued an apology letter to parents Nov. 16. He wrote that the book was not on a district approved literature list, nor was it age-appropriate. He also promised better reinforcement of procedures when it comes to relaying assigned books to parents. Several parents and students – some with signs – showed up to Thursday’s meeting to give public comment. Some protested and called for the teacher to be fired. But others argued that the sexual content was only a small portion of the book and that teachers should be given more discretion.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A computer used by Josh Duggar at work contained child pornography behind a partition that allowed the user to circumvent an application that monitors internet use, and metadata indicates the images were downloaded when the former reality TV star was working, computer forensics experts testified. Duggar, 33, is charged with receiving and possessing child pornography and faces up to 20 years in prison on each count if convicted. His federal trial began last week in northwest Arkansas. Defense attorneys for Duggar have argued that someone else downloaded or placed the child pornography onto the work computer, noting that no child pornography was found on Duggar’s phone or laptop. But federal prosecutors have detailed logs showing, minute by minute, the activity on Duggar’s computer that alternated between him sending personal messages, downloading child porn and saving pictures of notes. On Thursday, Justice Department computer expert James Fottrell testified that a Linux open-source operating system and a browser capable of encryption were installed behind a partition on the used-car dealership’s desktop computer. That essentially split the hard drive into a public-facing side that was business-related and included the tracking program and a secret second side using Linux and the browser, experts said. This allowed anyone using the computer to evade an accountability program installed to report to Duggar’s wife about inappropriate internet activity, such as searching for pornography.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A stench that emanated from a flood-control channel in a Los Angeles suburb and triggered thousands of complaints resulted from chemicals that flowed from a storage yard during a fire and caused vegetation to decay, air regulators said Friday. The South Coast Air Quality Management District said in a statement that it issued notices of violation to four companies and Los Angeles County, which is responsible for maintaining Dominguez Channel. The notices allege the emissions of hydrogen sulfide caused a public nuisance. The fire began Sept. 30 at a warehouse property in Carson where two companies stored large amounts of wellness and beauty products, and chemicals including ethanol subsequently flowed into the channel, the district said. Complaints of a rotten-egg stench began Oct. 3 and eventually came from thousands of people in at least a half-dozen communities in the area. The air district sent violation notices to two companies’ whose products were involved, the company that owns the property and its parent company, and LA County. Prologis Inc., the parent of the company that owns the property, said in a statement that it was working with the Los Angeles County Fire Department to safeguard the property from stormwater runoff and to clean up the fire debris.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Mile High City’s winter has started with a whimper, and the parched mountains to the west aren’t faring much better. Denver has already shattered its 87-year-old record for the latest measurable snowfall, set on Nov. 21, 1934, and it’s days away from breaking an 1887 record of 235 consecutive days without snow. The scenario is playing out across much of the Rocky Mountains, as the West at large is experiencing a megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. The warm, dry weather has drawn crowds to restaurant and bar patios in Denver, and the city’s parks and trails have been bustling with people basking in the sunshine in shorts, short sleeves and occasionally flip flops. As enjoyable as the weather is, climate scientists and meteorologists are warning that prolonged drought could threaten the region’s water supply and agriculture industry. It also could hurt tourism, which relies heavily on skiers, snowboarders, rafters and anglers. “Every day that goes by that we don’t see precipitation show up, and we see this year-to-year persistence of drought conditions, it just adds to a deficit. And we continue to add to this deficit year after year, particularly in the Colorado River Basin,” said Keith Musselman, a hydrologist at the University of Colorado-Boulder.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwalk: Multiple students at a southwestern Connecticut high school were hospitalized after using a vaping product at school. WABC-TV reports police responded to the school Friday afternoon after receiving a report of a student needing medical attention. Officers found several students had used a vaping product that appeared to have been tainted somehow and made the students very ill. The Brien McMahon High School students were taken to Norwalk Hospital for treatment. The Norwalk Public Schools district did not immediately respond to a message Saturday seeking an update on the students and more information about the incident. Police warned parents to discuss the dangers of vaping products with their children and said they can be tainted with dangerous or deadly chemicals.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A federal judge on Friday rejected a request by the University of Delaware to allow the state Supreme Court to weigh in on a lawsuit over coronavirus restrictions imposed by school officials last year. The judge ruled in August that current and former students could pursue claims that the university breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring. The plaintiffs are seeking partial refunds of their spring 2020 tuition and fees. Judge Stephanos Bibas said in his August ruling that the students had plausibly alleged the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” he wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Following that ruling, the university sought to petition the Delaware Supreme Court for a determination on whether state law permits an implied contract to be formed between a university and a student where an express written contract exists. The university also wanted the court to determine whether any implied terms sought by a student are limited to those involving “good faith and fair dealing.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Holiday decorations unveiled last week for Joe and Jill Biden’s first White House Christmas honor front-line workers who persevered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses, doctors, teachers, grocery store workers and others are recognized in this year’s gigantic Gingerbread White House, which was made into a 350-pound gingerbread village with the addition of a school and police, fire and gas stations, as well as a hospital, a post office, a grocery store and a warehouse to honor workers who stayed on the job. Fewer people are likely to see the decked-out mansion in person this year, with public tours still suspended because of the continuing threat from COVID-19. But videos, photos and other details are available at WhiteHouse.gov/Holidays. “Gifts from the Heart” is the theme. In remarks thanking volunteers for decorating, the first lady explained the vision behind her theme, speaking of unity and her view that everyone comes together around faith, family and friendship, gratitude and service, and love for one’s community. Front-line workers are also represented in the iridescent doves and shooting stars that illuminate the East Colonnade hallway, “representing the peace and light brought to us by all the front-line workers and first responders during the pandemic,” the guidebook says.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: Nearly two decades after earning a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and more than four years after his death, rock icon Tom Petty has been awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the University of Florida. The school’s board of trustees unanimously voted to award Thomas Earl Petty a posthumous doctoral degree in music during a Friday meeting. Born and raised in Gainesville, Petty once worked as a groundskeeper at UF as he tried to make it in the music industry, but he was never enrolled. Petty passed away from an accidental drug overdose in October 2017. Days later during a UF home football game, the song “I Won’t Back Down” was played at the stadium as a memorial to Petty. The song has since become a regular feature at Gators games. Usually backed by the Heartbreakers, Petty broke through in the 1970s and went on to sell more than 80 million records, featuring hits like “Free Fallin,’ ” “Refugee” and “American Girl.” Petty and the Heartbreakers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The University of Georgia is asking regents to name two buildings for some of the university’s earliest Black graduates. Last week’s proposal followed a decision by the University System of Georgia regents not to remove names of any people associated with slavery, segregation or the mistreatment of Native Americans from 75 buildings statewide. University President Jere Morehead said UGA would seek to name its existing science library for Shirley Mathis McBay, the first African American to earn a doctorate from the university. UGA also is asking regents to name a dormitory under construction for Harold A. Black, Mary Blackwell Diallo and Kerry Rushin Miller. They were the first three African American students to enroll at UGA as freshmen and graduate. Regents decide the names of buildings and facilities at all of Georgia’s 26 public universities and colleges. Their next scheduled meeting is in January. “Through these namings, we acknowledge the importance of these pioneers in the history of our institution,” Morehead said in a statement. “We celebrate their remarkable achievements and recognize the profoundly positive, lasting impact they have made on the University of Georgia.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Amid a continuing crisis over fuel contaminating the Navy’s tap water at Pearl Harbor, Honolulu’s water utility said Friday that it shut off one of its wells so it doesn’t taint its own supply with petroleum from an underground aquifer it shares with the military. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply said it acted shortly after the Navy on Thursday disclosed that a water sample from one of its wells had shown the presence of petroleum. The well is near a giant World War II-era underground fuel tank complex that has been the source of multiple fuel leaks over the years. The tap water problems have afflicted one of the military’s most important bases, home to submarines, ships and the commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific region. They also threaten to jeopardize one of Honolulu’s most important aquifers and water sources. Nearly 1,000 military households have complained about their tap water smelling like fuel or of physical ailments like stomach cramps and vomiting. The Navy water system serves 93,000 people. The Navy said Thursday that it would flush clean water through its distribution system to clear residual petroleum products from the water, followed by testing to make sure the water meets Environmental Protection Agency drinking standards. The Navy said it will investigate how contaminants got into the well and fix it.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Far-right activist Ammon Bundy says hours he spent campaigning to be the next governor should count toward his community service requirement after he was convicted of obstructing police during his arrest for trespassing at the state Capitol. Aaron Welling, Bundy’s campaign treasurer, wrote to Ada County’s 4th District Court that Bundy has “completed 1,621 hours of public service,” doing what appears to be campaign activities. In the letter submitted late last month on campaign letterhead, Welling said that Bundy has traveled the state while encouraging people to “become more active in holding public officials accountable” and that he encouraged people to register to vote. When asked by phone whether the letter described community service or campaign activities, Welling told the Idaho Press newspaper: “It is what it is. If the courts don’t like it, the courts don’t like it.” Bundy was convicted of misdemeanor trespassing and resisting or obstructing officers during a jury trial earlier this summer. He was ordered to pay more than $1000 in fines and sentenced to a few days in jail, but the sentence was commuted to 40 hours of public service to be completed within 6 months. The conviction stemmed from Bundy’s Aug. 25, 2020, arrest after he refused to leave an auditorium in the Statehouse that officials ordered cleared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A civil rights attorney joined Jelani Day’s mother Friday to demand the FBI take charge of an investigation into why the Illinois State University graduate student disappeared in August and was later found dead in a river. Ben Crump told a news conference at Rainbow PUSH headquarters in Chicago that the Justice Department must step in and investigate Day’s death as urgently as it has probed cases of suspected foul play involving white victims, such as Gabby Petito. Crump, who is Black, gained prominence by representing the families of victims of police brutality and vigilante violence. “We will make him a priority,” Crump said Friday of Day. “There is a killer out there on the loose of this young Black man, and we need to find him.” A coroner determined in October that Day died from drowning but said it was unclear how the 25-year-old had gone into the Illinois River, 60 miles north of Bloomington, where he was last seen. LaSalle County’s coroner said an autopsy on Day found no evidence of “manual strangulation, an assault or altercation, sharp, blunt or gunshot injury.” Authorities have said his death remains under investigation. But Day’s mother, Carmen Bolden Day, said law enforcement officials have all but told her they believe her son died by suicide, which she dismissed out of hand.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The two Indiana-raised turkeys given Thanksgiving pardons by President Joe Biden are now at their new Purdue University home. The turkeys arrived last week and were welcomed by visitors on the West Lafayette campus’ Memorial Mall. The turkeys named Peanut Butter and Jelly will live at Purdue’s Animal Sciences Research and Education Center, where the school says they’ll spend their days in an enclosed setting with access to a shaded grassy area. Animal sciences professor Marisa Erasmus told WLFI-TV that having the turkeys on campus will provide a chance to explain more about the birds. Indiana ranks fourth in the country in turkey production, according to Purdue. The two turkeys were raised by Jasper, Indiana-based Farbest Farms, which says it oversees the raising of about 15 million turkeys each year with growers in Indiana, Illinois and Kentucky. The birds were featured in a Nov. 19 ceremony at the White House during which Biden continued the annual tradition of sparing them from the fate met by millions of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, launched in 2015 by the Iowa Attorney General’s Office, has finally worked through the state’s evidence kit backlog, Attorney General Tom Miller announced last week. Iowa received $3 million in federal grant money to tackle its backlog, with roughly 3,800 untested evidence kits collected prior to April 2015, including some dating back to the 1990s. The initiative worked with a private lab to test 1,606 of those kits, resulting in 852 valid DNA samples and 290 matches with other DNA profiles in federal databases. Twenty-six of those belonged to people previously convicted of sex crimes. Others were referred to local prosecutors and have so far resulted in four criminal cases and two convictions. In announcing the conclusion of the project Tuesday, Miller touted not only the hard work of sorting out the backlog but also procedural changes and additional staffing that will allow the state to process sexual assault evidence faster, with more transparency to victims, and without allowing another backlog to develop despite an 87% increase in kits submitted to the state lab for testing. “We’ve gone from a backlog that was a significant problem to a system where it takes eight weeks to test – and it can be tracked during that eight weeks,” Miller said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Dr. Lee Norman, who led the state through the coronavirus pandemic until his abrupt departure last month, has said in an interview that he was “Fauci’d” out by COVID-19 politics. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly announced Nov. 19 that Norman had stepped down both as top administrator at the state Department of Health and Environment and as state health officer. He had been the health department’s top administrator since Kelly took office in January 2019. He was replaced quickly by Janet Stanek, a longtime hospital administrator from Topeka. But in an interview with Kansas News Service published Tuesday, Norman said he resigned because he was asked. He cited constant friction between the governor and the Republican-led Legislature. “The shameful treatment in the Trump administration of public health leaders, I think, set the stage for having the same thing happen at the state level,” Norman said, citing frequent criticism from the right of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert. Referring to the constant criticism, Norman said: “To be honest with you, I think I was Fauci’d.” Kelly, in announcing Norman’s departure, praised him as “the most consequential” leader in the department’s history.\n\nKentucky\n\nMurray: A century-old Confederate statue outside a western Kentucky courthouse has been vandalized with red paint, authorities said. The incident involving a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee outside the Calloway County Courthouse was reported Thursday morning, Sheriff Nicky Knight told the Murray Ledger and Times. The monument had red paint on its base as well as the statue of Lee atop it before volunteers with Sons of Confederate Veterans and other community members cleaned it, news outlets report. The statue had drawn calls for its removal last year, including a resolution from the Murray City Council asking county officials to “expeditiously remove and relocate” the monument. County officials decided to keep it, saying it was erected to honor residents who fought for the Confederacy and not, “as several have argued, for the purpose of promoting continued oppression.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nHolly Beach: Dredging has begun for a marsh creation project in southwestern Louisiana. The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority said the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock is expected to complete the 308 acres of marsh in January in Cameron Parish northwest of Holly Beach. “The project will restore critical habitat for fish, wildlife, and the people and communities who depend on those resources,” the authority’s executive director, Bren Haase, said Thursday. This is the second phase of a $3 million project that started by creating 2.3 miles of terraces to slow waves. The agency says those were finished in June. The area has been hit hard by subsidence, drought, surges from storms including Hurricane Rita in 2005, and saltwater retention caused by poor drainage resulting from silted-in canals. The authority said 1.9 million cubic yards of sediment will be pumped from the Gulf of Mexico to make the new marsh. “The Cameron Meadows project will fortify the natural buffer that protects southwest Louisiana from storm surge while restoring hundreds of acres of coastal marsh habitat lost due to hurricanes and other factors,” agency chairman Chip Kline said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: An abandoned Maine Central Railroad Company corridor is being converted to a new multiuse trail. The Madison Branch spans 32 miles across Kennebec and Somerset Counties and will connect with the Maine Interconnected Trail System and Maine ATV Trail System, officials said. “Snowmobiles and ATVs are as much a part of the Maine outdoor experience as hiking boots, snowshoes, and skis,” said Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. “My administration has listened to our off-road recreational vehicle riding community who wants to be able to travel long distances, legally and safely, and have a good time.” The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry completed the purchase in November from Pan Am Railways at the cost of just over $1 million.\n\nMaryland\n\nPoolesville: A home was accidentally burned to the ground by an owner trying to get rid of a snake infestation, officials said. The homeowner in Poolesville, a town about 25 miles outside Washington, D.C., was attempting to use smoke to purge the snakes from the house, according to Montgomery County Fire Department officials. In the process, the homeowner caught the house on fire, causing about $1 million in damage, The Washington Post reports. The fire broke out about 10 p.m. Nov. 23, officials said. Pete Piringer, a spokesman for the county fire department, said on Twitter that 75 firefighters were called to put out the blaze that started in the basement. Piringer said that the fire, caused by placing coals too close to combustible material, was accidental and that no people were hurt. But he said the well-being of the snakes was “undetermined.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Middle and high school students would learn about the history of genocide and human rights issues under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The bill requires middle schools and high schools in the state to include instruction on the history of genocide. The legislation comes as incidences of hate and antisemitism are on the rise across the country, with several incidents reported in Massachusetts over the past year, according to supporters of the legislation. Massachusetts has not required education on the Holocaust or other genocides as part of its classroom curriculum. Lawmakers renewed the push for mandating education about the history of genocide earlier this year after a Duxbury high school football coach was fired following reports that the team used antisemitic language, including a mention of Auschwitz, in its on-field play calling. This bill would create a Genocide Education Trust Fund to support the development of teaching materials and to provide professional development training for educators. The legislation would also require school districts to annually file a description of their lesson plan and programs to educate students about genocides with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state Senate on Thursday unanimously approved $3.3 billion in water infrastructure spending to replace lead pipes and repair aging dams around the state while also sending money to a Detroit-area system that has struggled with flooding blamed on climate change. The House will next consider the massive influx of aid, likely in the new year. It includes about $2.4 billion in federal funding – $1.4 billion from the infrastructure law enacted last month and nearly $1 billion from the pandemic rescue law passed in March. Senators initially proposed $600 million to replace service lines that can leach lead into drinking water if the supply isn’t properly treated. They upped it to $1 billion following the passage of the federal infrastructure bill. Benton Harbor currently is grappling with elevated lead levels in homes. The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated Michigan has 460,000 lead pipes in the ground, the third-most in the country. State regulations, made tougher following Flint’s water crisis, generally require that every line be replaced by 2040 – which could cost $2.5 billion in today’s dollars.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: The U.S. Forest Service plans to reduce the number of entry permits for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness next year, citing damage to natural resources, crowding and congestion. The Forest Service didn’t say how many permits would be eliminated, nor which entry points into the million-acre wilderness would be affected. Superior National Forest spokeswoman Joanna Gilkeson said the reduction will be spread across the entire wilderness, with a focus on more popular entry points and lakes where visitors have complained over the years about resource damage and an inability to find campsites. The number of visitors to the Boundary Waters has surged amid the COVID-19 pandemic as people look for more outdoor recreation. Nearly 166,000 people visited the BWCA in 2020, a 16% jump from the previous year and the most in at least a decade, according to the U.S. Forest Service. The number of permits issued jumped from about 25,000 to more than 30,000, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. The increased popularity played a role in what Forest Service officials said was “unprecedented natural resource damage,” including cutting of trees, littering, and improper disposal of human waste. There were also reports of increased crowding and noise levels, plus disruptive, oversized groups.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has declared that a state law allowing landlords to seize tenants’ belongings during the eviction process is unconstitutional. In his Tuesday order, U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills called the Mississippi law “unpredictable and absurd” and said it goes further than eviction statutes in any other state in the U.S. Under current law, “Mississippi tenants who overstay their lease may be confronted with the loss of virtually everything they own, even cherished belongings such as family photos and diplomas which have no discernable economic value to the lessor,” Mills wrote. Mills was tasked with reviewing Mississippi’s law after Columbus resident Samantha Conner filed a lawsuit last year against an apartment rental company, the apartment’s owner and manager, and the Lowndes County constable. She was aided by a low-income housing clinic at the University of Mississippi School of Law. When she was evicted in 2019, Conner said, her landlord changed the locks on her apartment and refused to let her take any of her belongings from inside, including her computer and hard drive needed for her work as a paralegal, keepsakes from when her son was a baby, family photographs and personal records. Many of her personal items were later discarded by her landlord.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A state health department analysis shows cities that have required masks to combat the coronavirus pandemic this year saw fewer infections, but Republican Gov. Mike Parson insisted Thursday that mandates don’t work. The analysis was first reported Wednesday by The Missouri Independent and the Documenting COVID-19 project at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation following an open-records request. Parson’s office asked the health department for information on the impact of mask mandates on infections, according to emails obtained in the request. In response, the agency last month compared infection rates in urban centers, where mask mandates were in place, with rural areas between April and November. The data shows that cities with mask mandates saw fewer infections and deaths across the board. Parson on Thursday responded to the Independent’s report with a scathing 12-part Twitter thread attacking the reporter. He described the article as “purposefully misleading” and said it left out important context. “There is no definite evidence that proves mandates solely saved lives and prevented COVID-19 infections in Missouri’s biggest cities,” Parson said. He added that mask mandates “do not work and can have collateral health consequences.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Helium prospecting is picking up in north-central Montana, with Canadian companies expanding south after years of development in Saskatchewan and Alberta. Montana oil and gas records show at least two companies drilling wells in an area spanning Toole, Hill and Liberty counties. Developers say geological formations on the U.S. side of the border share similarities with areas in Canada where helium development has become part of a larger plan for long-term economic development. “It all goes back to geology,” Genga Nadaraju, Avanti Energy vice president of subsurface geology, told The Billings Gazette. “Helium is the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium. It comes up from basement rock. Helium is everywhere, but in that area, there are higher concentrations of helium and the right geological conditions. We have reservoir rock, we have structure and we have a seal where you can trap it.” Drilling information at the Montana Board of Oil, Gas and Conservation shows development in potential helium sites. Permit holders have six months to show the state what they’re drilling for, but companies are disclosing Montana development to would-be investors.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: U.S. Rep. Don Bacon is among a list of Republicans being targeted by former President Donald Trump, who is calling for a “Republican patriot” to challenge the Omaha lawmaker in next year’s primary election. On Wednesday, Trump reiterated in a statement his call for Bacon and 12 other lawmakers to face primary challenges, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Trump has targeted Bacon for his vote last month in support of President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. Bacon was one of 13 House Republicans who voted for the bill. Bacon’s campaign said Wednesday that Trump is “entitled to his views” but that the congressman “has a strong record of delivering results for the people of Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.” Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts also issued a statement Wednesday defending Bacon, saying the congressman “has served our country honorably, he has done a good job serving the 2nd Congressional District, and has earned their trust time after time.” So far, no primary challenger has filed to run against Bacon. At least two Democrats – state Sen. Tony Vargas, of Omaha, and Omaha therapist and mental health advocate Alisha Shelton – have announced their candidacies for the seat.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In a federal effort to forcibly assimilate Native Americans into Euro-American culture, more than 20,000 students were sent to the Stewart Indian School, among more than 350 residential schools that the U.S. Interior Department plans to examine as part of the Federal Boarding School Initiative Review. On Friday, Gov. Steve Sisolak heard stories from tribal elders about the school’s history. The governor, tribal leaders, state agency heads and Interior officials discussed ways the state – which funded the school’s construction and helped gather children to send there – can contribute to the federal efforts to confront historic injustices and intergenerational trauma and honor the children who died at boarding schools. Descendants of Paiute, Washoe and Shoshone people who attended Stewart during the 90 years it was in operation told stories of bounties being offered to bring Native children to the school; of students attempting to run away due to starvation; and of extreme overcrowding in dormitories. The governor apologized on behalf of the state and promised to fully cooperate with the Interior Department and its first Native American secretary, Deb Haaland, as they review records and investigate the federal government’s past policies and oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a long-brewing mental health crisis for the state’s children, particularly those whose illness manifests as aggression, according to the latest annual report by a state watchdog agency. The 2021 report released Thursday by the Office of the Child Advocate highlights the state’s recent rollout of community-based services to prevent psychiatric hospitalizations and the long waits in emergency rooms that often precede them. But implementation was long delayed, and in the meantime, the pandemic further stressed children with “isolation, uncertainty and fear,” the report says. The effect was greatest on children with chronic developmental disabilities or those whose illness was so neglected or aggravated that they became assaultive or aggressive, according to the report. Moira O’Neill, the child advocate, said such children have been systemically excluded from acute psychiatric care at Hampstead Hospital, the private psychiatric hospital that the state is in the process of purchasing for children’s treatment. The state moved children from New Hampshire Hospital to Hampstead last year, but the contract excludes patients with “violent or aggressive behaviors resulting in criminal charges or serious bodily harm.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city will host a three-day country music concert festival next August, headlined by Luke Bryan and Morgan Wallen. The Tidalwave Music Festival will be held on the beach Aug. 12-14, 2022. An additional headliner will be announced in the coming weeks. “We knew we wanted to bring our country music festival concept to the northeast coast, but the location had to be just right,” said Brian O’Connell, president of country touring at Live Nation. “The perfect spot by the ocean in Atlantic City. We can’t wait until next summer to bring these world-class acts, alongside a tailor-made festival experience.” Also performing will be Lauren Alaina, Blanco Brown, Breland, Travis Denning, Riley Green, Lindsay Ell, Hardy, Jon Langston, Tracy Lawrence, Chase Rice, Runaway June, Elvie Shane, DeeJay Silver, Mitchell Tenpenny and Lainey Wilson. Three-day passes will go on sale beginning Dec. 13 at 10 a.m. EST at www.tidalwavefest.com.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: James Lujan has resigned as Rio Arriba County sheriff after being sentenced to prison on felony convictions of aiding a felon and intimidating a witness in 2017. Lujan submitted his resignation Thursday after being sentenced to a three-year prison term, one day after state District Court jurors convicted him following a three-day trial. A judge denied a request by Lujan’s attorney that his client remain free pending an appeal, and the 60-year-old Lujan was taken into custody by Santa Fe County sheriff’s deputies. Lujan was convicted on charges stemming from allegations he helped former Española City Councilor Philip Chacon evade police following a high-speed chase. The jury found Lujan guilty of harboring a felon for helping conceal Chacon as police were searching for him. Lujan also was found guilty of bribery of a witness for threatening one of his deputies to prevent him from revealing Chacon’s whereabouts to other officers.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A new allegation of sexual harassment against Chris Cuomo emerged just days before CNN announced it was firing the anchor amid an investigation into work he did defending his brother from similar harassment allegations. Attorney Debra Katz said Sunday that her client was the victim of “serious sexual misconduct” by Cuomo and that she had contacted CNN about the woman’s allegations Wednesday. CNN suspended Cuomo last week after details emerged about how he assisted his brother, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, as the politician faced sexual harassment allegations. Katz said the accuser decided to come forward came after the New York attorney general’s office released evidence showing Chris Cuomo had taken a much more active role than previously thought in strategizing and helping to craft a response to the allegations his brother was facing. When the initial allegations surfaced against the then-governor, Chris Cuomo had told viewers he had “always cared very deeply about these issues,” Katz said. “Hearing the hypocrisy of Chris Cuomo’s on-air words and disgusted by his efforts to try to discredit these women, my client retained counsel to report his serious sexual misconduct against her to CNN,” Katz said in the statement.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s 2022 elections under new legislative and congressional maps can begin as scheduled this week after judges on Friday rejected demands from lawsuit filers who claim the lines have to be blocked because they so egregiously favor Republicans. The refusal of a three-judge panel to issue preliminary injunctions against the boundaries drawn and approved by GOP majorities in the General Assembly last month means candidate filings for the March 8 primary may start at noon Monday. One of the lawsuits, filed by the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, mathematicians and voters, challenges both the legislative and congressional maps. The other, filed by voters supported by a group affiliated with the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, focuses solely on the state’s U.S. House map. The judges said there was a reasonable doubt about whether the lines violated the state constitution. The plaintiffs in the League of Conservation Voters lawsuit filed an appeal notice with the state Court of Appeals late Friday. And Friday’s ruling doesn’t throw out the lawsuits that formed the basis for the injunction requests heard in Wake County court.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The cost of the state’s special five-day session last month is within the amount allotted, a legislative budget analyst said Thursday. Figures released to the Associated Press show costs incurred by taxpayers total just more than $301,000. About $316,000 was budgeted for the session, highlighted by redistricting legislation and the spending of nearly the entire amount of the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus aid available to the state. The Republican-led Legislature also approved policy-related measures, including bills banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates and the teaching of certain concepts about race and racism in public schools. Eleven of the Legislature’s 141 members had not submitted lodging and mileage expenses as of Thursday, said Allen Knudson, the lead budget analyst at the Legislative Council, the Legislature’s research arm. “We expect the final cost of the special session to be very close to the amount budgeted,” Knudson said. Most legislators make $189 daily while in session, with an extra $10 or $15 per day for certain leaders. Each day they are in a special or reconvened session costs taxpayers about $64,000, budget writers estimate. Legislators who do not live in Bismarck or Mandan are eligible for a housing and travel allowance.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge on Friday refused to dismiss the 25-count murder indictment against a doctor accused of ordering excessive painkillers for hospital patients, meaning one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional will proceed toward trial. William Husel, 46, has pleaded not guilty. His lawyers say he was providing comfort care for dying patients in the Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System, not trying to kill them. Mount Carmel’s review concluded Husel ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years, but the fired doctor was charged only in cases involving at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. The previous prosecutor on the case, who wasn’t reelected, had said using dosages that large in nonsurgical situations – for people being taken off ventilators – pointed to an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued that during the still-secret grand jury proceedings, the prosecution must have misrepresented whether such dosages would surely be deadly, and that the resulting indictment should therefore be dismissed. They noted that prosecutors had records from a patient who was not part of the indictment who received even larger dosages and survived for days.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt denied clemency Friday for a death row inmate sentenced to die for the 1985 shooting death of a Putnam City schoolteacher. The Republican governor’s decision clears the way for Bigler Stouffer II, 79, to receive a lethal injection at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester. It comes despite a 3-2 recommendation from the state’s Pardon and Parole Board that Stouffer’s sentence be commuted to life in prison without parole. Several members of the board voiced concerns about the state’s ability to humanely execute people after John Grant convulsed on the gurney and vomited during his lethal injection in October. Stouffer has maintained his innocence in the attack on Linda Reaves and her boyfriend, Doug Ivens, that left Reaves dead and Ivens seriously wounded. Stouffer was convicted and sentenced to death in 2003 after his first conviction and death sentence were overturned. He said at his parole board hearing last month that Ivens was shot as the two men fought over a gun at Ivens’ home and that Reaves was already dead when he arrived. Prosecutors said Stouffer went to the home to borrow the gun from Ivens, then fatally shot Reaves and wounded Ivens in an attempt to gain access to Ivens’ $2 million life insurance policy. At the time, Stouffer was dating Ivens’ ex-wife.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: TriMet officials say bus services will be reduced starting Jan. 9 because of an extreme shortage of bus operators. The Portland-area transit agency said TriMet would temporarily reduce service levels by 9%, meaning TriMet will shrink weekly bus service on about 20 of its 84 bus lines, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. TriMet Spokesperson Roberta Altstadt said services will be less frequent on weekdays for those lines, and most affected lines will follow Saturday schedules. Altstadt said riders should check TriMet’s online trip planner after Jan. 9. As of last week, Altstadt said the agency was short 45 operators. The agency dropped service levels by about that much in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a nearly 70% decrease in ridership. Public transit use slowly began to increase again, but TriMet has had trouble recruiting workers – a problem it hasn’t historically faced. Altstdat said TriMet has stepped up hiring efforts. Bill Bradley, an executive board member with Amalgamated Transit Union 757, representing about 2,700 TriMet workers, said the union believes the current shortage is higher, about 60 drivers. The agency saw a rise in assaults on operators around the beginning of the pandemic, which Bradley said hasn’t decreased. The stressors and dangers have taken a toll on operators, he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf followed through on his veto threat Thursday, rejecting Republican-penned legislation to allow people to carry a firearm openly or concealed, without a permit, adding to his total for Pennsylvania’s chief executive with the most vetoes in more than four decades. Wolf, a Democrat, called the permitless-carry bill “dangerous.” Wolf’s veto comes amid a tide of deadly gun violence in Philadelphia, the state’s largest city, and political finger-pointing over blame. Republicans said the bill would have made people safer. Wolf has said it is a top priority to address what he says is a gun violence crisis affecting largely minority communities, but the Republican-controlled Legislature has rejected nearly all his proposals. The bill he vetoed Thursday would have removed the requirement that gun owners get a permit to carry a gun that is concealed, such as under clothing or in their vehicle’s glove box. It also would have wiped out a law, applying only to Philadelphia, that requires gun owners to get a permit to openly carry a firearm in the city. According to online state records, Wolf penned his 52nd veto with 13 months left in his second term, more than any other governor since Milton Shapp, who left office in 1979.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The largest state employees’ union in Rhode Island has approved a new four-year contract that includes $3,000 COVID-19 vaccination bonuses, officials said. Council 94 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents about 3,800 workers, overwhelmingly approved of the deal Thursday. The contract also includes 2.5% annual raises. Union and state officials said the bonus will help retain strained public workers. “Our employees continue to provide services while shouldering increased demands because of the pandemic, and it is important we recognize those efforts and make the state an employer of choice,” state Director of Administration James Thorsen said in a statement. “This was done so that we could retain your public servants,” Council 94 Vice President Lynn Loveday said. Workers can get the bonus without being vaccinated against COVID-19 if they are granted a religious or medical exemption. The program is estimated to cost $9.6 million and will be funded with federal relief dollars. Democratic Gov. Daniel McKee told WPRI-TV that the contract “was fair to the workers and fair to the taxpayers.” The bonuses drew criticism from some Democrats and Republicans who said it was unfair and appeared to condemn the unvaccinated.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster and his wife, Peggy, are inviting people to come to their house Monday evening to view their Christmas decorations and listen to carols. The open house at the Governor’s Mansion in downtown Columbia is scheduled for 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday. The Columbia Garden Club is decorating the mansion, and light refreshments will be served. Simone Bryant of Benedict College has been invited to sing Christmas carols. Admission is free, but the governor and first lady ask guests to please bring canned goods to donate to Harvest Hope Food Bank. Guided tours of the governor’s mansion are also available on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings over the next two weeks.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Department of Health is beginning to issue medical marijuana cards, but officials say it could be months before dispensaries will have anything to sell. Municipalities across the state are also receiving applications for permits from those who want to open a dispensary. The businesses must sell marijuana that is grown in the state, and with no cultivation facilities licensed in South Dakota, the dispensaries, for now, will have nothing to sell. Importing cannabis products across state lines remains a federal offense. State health officials say they’ve received 11 cultivation applications. Commercial grow facilities are now going through the state and local application process. It could take months for them to begin selling cannabis. In the meantime, medical marijuana cardholders can grow up to three plants for personal use. Cities have taken different approaches to selling medical marijuana. Yankton will permit two medical cannabis dispensaries. “Once those two applicants get state approval, they still have to do a certificate of occupancy with the city,” said Lisa Yardley, the city’s deputy finance officer. “They still have to do a site permit. They still have to do any building permits, building inspection.” Yankton will not allow any marijuana cultivation or processing operations.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday had harsh words for state officials who continue to enforce retroactive punishments against sex offenders, some of whom committed their offenses decades before the state’s sex offender law took effect. “Tennessee officials continue to flout the Constitution’s guarantees,” U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger wrote in her ruling ordering officials to remove eight men from the sex offender registry and stop subjecting them to restrictions on where they can live and work, among other things. In April, a different federal judge, also in the Middle District of Tennessee, ordered two men be removed from the sex offender registry, finding that it was unconstitutional to subject them to sex offender laws that were written after they committed their offenses. In her Friday order, Trauger cited the April ruling and other similar recent rulings. She noted that the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 ruled against the retroactive enforcement of a Michigan sex offender law. “The federal district courts of this state have repeatedly concluded that the same analysis applies … to Tennessee’s own, very similar scheme and policies,” Trauger wrote. Despite those rulings, “Tennessee officials have continued to impose the state’s repeatedly-held-to-be-unlawful policy on other, similarly situated individuals.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: For more than seven years, no one has known what happened to $600,000 in checks and cash that were stolen from a safe at Pastor Joel Osteen’s Houston megachurch, which has one of the largest congregations in the country. Now, there’s a possible plot twist in the case: The money might never have left the church, and a plumber could have helped solve the mystery. Houston police are investigating whether cash and checks discovered by a plumber during repair work that was being done at Lakewood Church is connected to the money that was stolen in 2014. The revived investigation comes after a plumber on Thursday called “The Morning Bullpen with George, Mo & Erik on 100.3 The Bull” during a segment on the Houston radio station in which people were asked to talk about the most unusual things of value they had ever found. The plumber went on the air with his story of what he found while repairing a leaky toilet at the church about four weeks ago. “I went to go remove the toilet, and I moved some insulation away, and about 500 envelopes fell out of the wall. I was like, ‘Oh, wow.’ I got my flashlight, shined up in there,” he said in audio provided by the station. The plumber said he thought the envelopes full of money were connected to the 2014 theft and immediately told the church’s maintenance supervisor, who contacted police.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Zion National Park will soon require reservations to hike a famous southern Utah trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff, officials announced Friday. As of April 1, people who want to hike the narrow Angels Landing hike will need permits provided through a lottery system. The lottery will be fairer to visitors and reduce crowding on the trail, said superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh. Crowding is a major concern on the trail edged by a sheer cliff, where a small number of people typically fall and die every year, park officials have said. The number of people visiting Zion has been growing rapidly in recent years, swelling from about 2.8 million visits in 2011 to nearly 4.5 million visits in 2019. Angels Landing is one of the most sought-after destinations, and more than 300,000 people hiked it in 2019, according to park officials. There will be two lotteries, one seasonal and another for one day ahead of planned hikes. Each drawing costs $6 per person to enter, and people who win must pay a $3-per-person fee. That will cover the cost of running the lottery and rangers to check permits on the trail. The permit system will apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, often called the “chain section” because it has metal handholds driven into the rock.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The public is invited to cut down a Christmas tree from Green Mountain National Forest. A required $5 permit can be purchased online or at Green Mountain National Forest offices in Manchester and Rochester. This year, the U.S. Forest Service is providing free Christmas tree vouchers to fourth grade students in support of the Every Kid Outdoors initiative. It was created so that the country’s fourth graders and their families could discover wildlife, resources and history for free. The students must register online at everykidoutdoors.gov and present a printed voucher to redeem a Christmas tree voucher, U.S. Forest Service officials said. Trees may be harvested within designated areas of the forest and must be cut 6 inches or less from the ground, the Forest Service said. All trash and litter from the activity, including woody debris, must be removed from roads, ditches and culvert openings, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: A three-judge panel overseeing a recount in a close Virginia Beach state House race upheld the Republican candidate’s victory Friday, a decision that also reaffirms the GOP’s takeover of the chamber and completes the party’s sweep of last month’s elections. Republicans also claimed the statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general in the Nov. 2 balloting. Those wins were a dramatic turnaround in a state where the GOP had not won a statewide race since 2009. Democrats still hold a 21-19 majority in the Senate – where elections won’t be held until 2023 – splitting control of the Legislature. The certified results from the election showed Republicans leading in 52 districts and the Democrats leading in 48. The recount in the 85th District race resulted in Democratic incumbent Alex Askew gaining 12 votes, but he still trailed Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh by 115 votes. There was one contested ballot. The panel found that the intent of the voter was unclear, so that ballot was not counted for either candidate. After Democrats requested recounts in two races with razor-thin margins, that left open the remote possibility of a 50-50 split. Though the second recount, in the 91st District, is still expected to proceed this week, Democrats no longer have a shot at undoing the GOP’s majority.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: An explosive device was tossed at the Islamic Center of Olympia – an act leaders of the facility said was an apparent act of intimidation. “It seems like it was meant to stoke fear,” Mustafa Mohamedali, social secretary for the Islamic Center of Olympia, told KING5. The Washington chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations said nobody was hurt, and there was no damage Nov. 23, but neighbors heard the blast. The explosion is the latest in a series of assaults on houses of worship in the Puget Sound region, including churches, synagogues and mosques. In October, someone set fire to the Islamic Center of Tacoma. The Thurston County Sheriff’s Office didn’t respond to questions from KING5.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: John Hutchison will become the state Supreme Court’s chief justice Jan 1, the court announced Thursday. As chief justice, Hutchison will become the administrative leader of the state’s judiciary system, including circuit, family and magistrate courts. A new intermediate court system will open July 1. In 2020, Hutchison won a special election for a four-year term on the court. He was appointed in 2018 to the seat vacated by convicted former Justice Allen Loughry. The court also announced that Beth Walker will serve as chief justice in 2023. Walker also served as chief justice in 2019. The current chief justice is Evan Jenkins.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed five Republican-authored anti-abortion bills Friday. Evers, who is making his support for abortion rights a key plank of his 2022 reelection campaign, had been widely expected to veto the measures the GOP-controlled Legislature passed in October. “I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again today: as long as I’m governor, I will veto any legislation that turns back the clock on reproductive rights in this state – and that’s a promise,” Evers tweeted in announcing the vetoes. Republicans do not have enough votes in the Legislature to override the vetoes. One bill would impose criminal penalties on doctors who fail to give medical care in the extremely rare circumstance in which a baby is born alive following an abortion attempt. Violators would be guilty of a felony punishable by up to six years in prison. The bill also would make intentionally causing the death of a child born alive as a result of an abortion a felony punishable by life in prison. Doctors insist the proposal is a solution in search of a problem, as doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep those babies alive. A second bill Evers vetoed would require doctors to provide the parents of fetuses and embryos that test positive for a congenital condition information about the condition. A third would prohibit abortions based on a fetus’ sex, race or national origin.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The 14th annual Menorah Lighting Ceremony was held Wednesday at the state Capitol, where Rabbi Zalman Mendelsohn and Gov. Mark Gordon placed an emphasis on spreading a positive light this Hanukkah season. The event moved back indoors this year, filling a wing of the Capitol with people from around Wyoming, as well as food, music and the massive menorah that towered behind the podium. The Cheyenne Youth Symphony contributed a string ensemble to play classic Hanukkah songs prior to the event. When it was time to light the menorah, Medelsohn stepped to the podium and thanked the many people who had gathered for the event before holding a moment of remembrance for Rabbi Larry H. Moldo, who died in August 2020. To conclude the introduction, he offered a gift in the form of a metal sculpture of a menorah to Gordon, thanking him and first lady Jennie Gordon for embodying the “commonality that exists within each and every one of us.” “There’s so many different paths, so many different lifestyles and so many different political viewpoints,” Rabbi Mendelsohn said in his speech. “There’s a solid gold that brings us all together, with love, with humanity, with character and with a sense that we are all part of the same people of Wyoming.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/12/06"}]}

Why the April 2024 event is so ...", "text": "Editor's note: An updated cloud forecast for the April 2024 total solar eclipse is in. Read the latest eclipse forecast and news as of Wednesday, April 3.\n\nThe sky is filled with breathtaking wonders, but one occurring on April 8 is causing people to plan trips in droves, prompting fears of snarled highways and generating headline after headline.\n\nThe total solar eclipse on April 8 is causing such a stir because the rare event — where the shadow of the moon will plunge a narrow strip of land into darkness in the middle of the day — is an astronomical experience like no other that will be unusually accessible to millions of people.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse will fall over more places in the U.S. than the total eclipse before and after it. And the broad length of the path of totality – where Americans have the best shot of getting a clear view – is \"much wider\" than it was for the eclipse in 2017, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nA total solar eclipse is also far more impressive than a lunar or an annular solar eclipse. During an annular eclipse, the moon covers the Sun but leaves an outside ring some call a \"ring of fire\" — it darkens the sky instead of plunging Earth into a night-like darkness, which is what happens during a total solar eclipse. And a lunar eclipse – the appearance of a red moon – happens when the moon passes into the Earth's shadow, according to NASA.\n\n\"The eclipse in 2024 could be even more exciting due to differences in the path, timing, and scientific research,\" reads a post from NASA. And like past similar natural phenomena, the eclipse is expected to elicit a strong emotional reaction from the people who see it, including from those who identify with its cultural significance.\n\nTotal solar eclipses over the US are rare: The next one won't happen for 20 years\n\nThe next visible total solar eclipse to cross over the U.S. after April will come in more than two decades on Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nAnd that eclipse won't be as accessible as the 2024 one: The path of totality in 2044 will only touch the states of Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. Another total eclipse will pass over the U.S. in 2045 that will be more accessible to Americans, including for people who live in California, Florida and Nevada.\n\nSolar eclipses are rare in part because they can only occur during a new moon and when \"the moon's orbit is tilted five degrees to Earth's orbit around the Sun,\" according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThis eclipse will pass over millions of people and be a short drive for millions more\n\nNASA estimates 215 million adults in the U.S. saw the 2017 solar eclipse either in person or electronically and even more people will likely see April's eclipse.\n\nThe eclipse's path of totality will pass over cities like Dallas, Cleveland and Buffalo, New York. And those places will attract sky gazers from all over the country.\n\nSearches for short-term Airbnb rentals around those areas have surged. Transportation officials in areas along the path of totality are warning residents and travelers that the eclipse could create dangerous and busy traffic conditions on roads around places with the best view.\n\nClouds could ruin total eclipse:This map shows how likely that is by city.\n\nTotal solar eclipses are awe-inspiring experiences\n\nThis year's total solar eclipse is expected to cause emotional reactions.\n\nA study of the social effects after an eclipse shows people who viewed the 2017 eclipse in its path of totality experienced feeling like part of a collective more than those who were outside of that path.\n\nResearchers found \"that astronomical events may play a vital collective function by arousing awe and social tendencies that orient individuals toward their collectives.\" They used Twitter, now X, data from millions of users to come to their conclusion.\n\nMore:10 solar eclipse fun facts to share with your friends\n\nAfter a total solar eclipse in Australia last year, The Guardian reported on a range of emotions among people who experienced the natural phenomena. One woman was near tears.\n\nThe silence and darkness during the eclipse will also create uncertainty for animals.\n\nInterpretations of a total solar eclipse vary across cultures, experts say.\n\nApril's total solar eclipse:Will bring a surreal silence and confuse all sorts of animals\n\n\"Across the ages, cultures from around the world have interpreted eclipses in myriad ways,\" reads a post from the San Francisco based nonprofit organization The Exploratorium. \"Sometimes eclipses cause fear, awe, or a sense that the cosmic order has fallen out of balance.\"\n\n\"A recurring and pervasive embodiment of the eclipse was a dragon, or a demon, who devours the Sun,\" reads the post, for example. The ancient Chinese and Incas, for example, used different tactics to \"help the Sun fight off the dragon\" during an eclipse, according to the nonprofit organization.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauarui, Eric Lagatta, Elizabeth Weise, Cheryl McCloud; USA TODAY Network\n\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

And for another: The upcoming solar eclipse on April 8 is projected to last longer, be brighter and be visible to more people than the one seven years ago, astronomers say.\n\nWith just weeks to go until the Great North American Eclipse of 2024, here's everything you know about what's going to happen and how you can (safely) see it.\n\nWhen is the 2024 total solar eclipse?Your guide to glasses, forecast, where to watch.\n\nWhat is a solar eclipse?\n\nAny celestial object like a moon or a planet that passes between two other bodies can create an eclipse by obscuring the view of objects like the sun.\n\nA total eclipse occurs when the moon appears as the same size as the sun and blocks the entire disk from Earth, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. The resulting \"totality,\" whereby observers can see the outmost layer of the sun's atmosphere known as the corona, confuses animals – causing nocturnal creatures to stir and bird and insects to fall silent.\n\nA recent study even found that clouds activity is altered by eclipses as shallow cumulus clouds were observed vanishing when the moon obscured the sun.\n\nWhen and where to see the April 8 total solar eclipse\n\nOn April 8, the total solar eclipse will chart a 115-mile-wide path of totality across portions of Mexico the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the U.S. alone, hundreds of cities and smaller towns in 13 states lie along the path. An estimated 31 million Americans already live on the path, while millions more tourists are already making travel plans – sure to snarl traffic – to catch a glimpse of what is sure to be a spectacular sight, according to eclipse cartographer Michael Zeiler at GreatAmericanEclipse.com.\n\nAdditionally, small parts of Tennessee and Michigan are also expected to experience the eclipse, NASA says.\n\nMexico's Pacific coast will be the first location in continental North America to experience totality, which will occur at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, according to NASA.\n\nAs the moon's shadow travels northeast, totality in the U.S. will begin at 1:27 p.m. CDT in Eagle Pass, Texas. From there, the path will cut diagonally across the country before ending it's time in the U.S. around 3:33 p.m. EDT in Lee, Maine and entering Canada's maritime provinces, according to nationaleclipse.com.\n\nAlong the way, periods of darkness could last a mere few seconds or, in some cities, could surpass four minutes. And as if the dazzling solar eclipse won't be enough, there's a small chance that the horned \"devil comet\" may make an appearance that same day as it makes its closest orbital approach to Earth later in the month.\n\nIf you want to see the time and duration for when totality would occur near each of these locations, see these interactive maps.\n\nHow to safely view the solar eclipse\n\nUnlike partial solar eclipses, a total eclipse offers spectators a unique opportunity to gaze upon it with the naked eye, but only when the moon completely blocks out the sun and darkness falls.\n\nWhile you're unlikely to go blind, gazing directly at the sun's rays can do some serious damage to your retinas. So until the moment that totality occurs, proper safety eyewear is still a must, according to NASA.\n\nWhile some welding goggles may work, the best best remains certified eyewear, which is held to an international safety standard and is 100,000 times darker than most sunglasses to block nearly all visible, infrared and ultraviolet light.\n\nSolar eclipse glasses are readily available from plenty of vendors across the internet, but if you want to save some cash, there's a good chance your local library or another public institution is giving them away for free.\n\nJust watch out for cheap imitations. To make it easy while you're shopping online, the American Astronomical Society maintains a curated list of approved vendors.\n\nAnother simple method is to create your own pinhole projector to project the sun onto a nearby surface. The American Astronomical Society offers helpful instructions to set them up as well.\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse after 2024?\n\nWhether you live on the path of totality or need to find the nearest city that will be enveloped in daytime darkness, one thing is for sure: Now is the time to make your plans to see it.\n\nFor North America, the next total solar eclipse won't be until Aug. 23, 2044, according to NASA.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse.\n\nThe Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy, says that during the 2044 eclipse, the path of totality will only touch three states.\n\nThe eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nContributing: Gabe Hauari\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nTonight’s sturgeon supermoon could have you dancing in the moonlight – the type that only happens three to four times per year.\n\nNamed by the Native American Algonquin tribe after sturgeon fish that were more easily caught in the Great Lakes and other bodies of water during this time of year, the sturgeon moon ends 2022’s series of four supermoons, which began in May, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac. After sunset, look toward the southeast to watch this supermoon rise. It will reach peak illumination at 9:36 p.m. ET Thursday.\n\n“At certain times of the year, the moon is at its closest point to Earth and these are called supermoons,” said Mike Hankey, operations manager for the American Meteor Society, via email. “It’s just a natural point of the moon’s orbit. At each extreme, the moon is either a little bigger or a little bit smaller (at its furthest point), but it is not a huge difference.”\n\nThis nearest proximity is called the perigee, and it is only about 226,000 miles (363,300 kilometers) from Earth, according to NASA. That’s why a supermoon also appears slightly brighter than a regular full moon. The moon’s distance from Earth changes throughout the month since its orbit isn’t a perfect circle, according to The Old Farmer’s Almanac.\n\nIf you take a cool photo of the supermoon, you could share it on social media with the hashtag #NASAMoonSnap – the phrase NASA is using to track moon-inspired content leading up to the late-summer launch of Artemis I, the first test flight of the rocket and spacecraft that will send future astronauts to the moon, according to NASA’s Tumblr. The agency has shared a guide for photographing the moon, and will share some users’ content on its social media platforms during the launch broadcast.\n\nThe sturgeon moon will steal the spotlight of the Perseid meteor shower peaking Thursday through Saturday.\n\n“Bright moon phases are bad for meteor showers as they wash out the dimmer meteors,” Hankey said. “A full or almost full moon dominates one part of the sky, making that part undesirable for observing meteors. The full moon also lasts the entire night, leaving no hours of complete darkness, which is preferred.”\n\nThe Perseid meteor shower lasts from July 14 to September 1, and this year’s barely visible peak will happen at 11 p.m. ET on Friday (3:00 a.m. UTC Saturday), according to EarthSky. In previous years, the Perseids have been a highly anticipated shower in the Northern Hemisphere, where it’s usually more visible. But that’s only when the moon isn’t in a phase dominating the sky.\n\nThis year, the Perseids – which strengthen in number from late evening to early dawn – were more visible in early August when the moon appeared smaller and dimmer. In previous years, they were most visible in nearly moon-free skies.\n\nThe shower’s fragments come from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, which takes 133 years to orbit the sun just once, according to NASA. The comet last entered the inner solar system in 1992.\n\nThe supermoon — also called the sturgeon moon — rises as a jetliner approaches John F.

The partial solar eclipse on October 25 will be visible to people in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Northeast Africa, the Middle East, West Asia, India and western China.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse on November 8 can be seen in Asia, Australia, the Pacific, South America and North America between 3:01 a.m. ET and 8:58 a.m. ET. But for people in Eastern North America, the moon will be setting during that time.\n\nWear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can damage the eye.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers Ashley Strickland", "Kristen Rogers", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/24/simone-biles-amazon-union-strawberry-supermoon-5-things-know-thursday/5312809001/", "title": "Simone Biles, Amazon union, Strawberry supermoon: 5 things to ...", "text": "Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCondo building partially collapses in Miami\n\nA massive search and rescue effort was underway Thursday outside Miami after a 12-story, oceanside condo building partially collapsed into a massive pile of rubble, authorities said.

Included in the package is $579 billion in new money – less than the $1 trillion Biden first demanded, but far more than initial proposals from GOP senators. The sticking point has been how to pay for the massive transportation infrastructure package. While Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., noted there was a \"long list\" of ways to pay for it, most of those details have yet to be released and may still need to be worked out. Still, the agreement is expected to win approval from lawmakers in both chambers eager to address the country's infrastructure and also show that both sides can still forge bipartisan consensus in a Congress that's become increasingly partisan.\n\nPrefer to listen?

He was being held on charges of possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.\n\nTrump was at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach on Sunday afternoon when Secret Service agents walking the course ahead of him spotted a gun barrel in bushes. When they opened fire, the suspect fled in a black Nissan SUV, leaving behind a loaded, SKS-style assault rifle, a backpack, two bags, a digital camera and some food, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nRouth, 58, was detained a short time later, and a witness who saw the suspect fleeing the golf course identified Routh, the complaint says. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said Routh had been about 300-500 yards from Trump and that Routh's rifle and scope put him within range.\n\nTrump thanked the Secret Service and local authorities for their efforts. But he said President Joe Biden and Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris motivated the incident.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"He (Routh) believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at.\"\n\nIt was the second assassination attempt he has survived.

I think Congress should respond to their needs,\" Biden told reporters as he left the White House.\n\nTrump: 'Perhaps it's God'\n\nIn an interview on the social media site X, Trump offered a possible spiritual reason for surviving two assassination attempts in two months.\n\n\"There's something going on,\" he said. \"I mean, perhaps it's God wanting me to be president to save this country. Nobody knows.\"\n\nThe former president also continued to blame the anti-Trump \"rhetoric\" of Harris and Biden during the X Spaces program devoted mostly to the launch of a new cryptocurrency project to be led by his two eldest sons.\n\n- David Jackson\n\nRouth owned a small business, collaborated with local government in Hawaii\n\nRouth moved to Hawaii in 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile. He registered his company, Camp Box Honolulu, which specializes in building small storage structures, as a Hawaii business in January 2019, according to state records. However, the business registration expired this past January.\n\nIn 2019, Routh was featured in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, where he pledged to build tiny homes for the homeless in East Oahu. This initiative was part of Hawaii's Kauhale program, a collaborative effort between the state government and HomeAid Hawaii, a non-profit focused on developing housing solutions for individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness.\n\nAccording to organization Executive Director Kim Carvalho, the nonprofit did not use Routh's services after 2020.\n\n\"Ryan Routh volunteered with HomeAid Hawaii from 2018 to 2020, offering his company’s services in roofing and flooring for tiny home construction,” Carvalho said in a written statement. “He was not compensated, and no complaints were recorded during his time with us under HomeAid Hawaii's previous leadership.\"\n\nYesterday, investigators visited Routh's Kaaawa home, which is listed as his business address. Public records indicate that the home is owned by a woman who has previously shared addresses with Routh.\n\n– Jeremy Yurow\n\nBiden shares ‘cordial’ call with Trump\n\nBiden spoke with Trump on Monday evening and the president expressed his relief that the former president is safe, the White House said.\n\nThe White House said the two shared a “cordial conversation” and Trump thanked Biden for the call.\n\nBiden initially did not get Trump on the phone, the president told reporters when heading back to the White House after a trip to Philadelphia, according to the pool.

They have reached out to companies to get access to Routh's phone and social media accounts.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nFBI analyzing Routh's rifle, electronics, DNA\n\nVeltri said the bureau's headquarters and Quantico lab are analyzing various pieces of evidence collected through the investigation, including the rifle, scope, bags, electronics, and ceramic tiles that were collected from the scene.\n\nLaw enforcement has also collected DNA from the obtained items that is being sent to the Quantico lab for testing, and it plans to examine Routh's car, Veltri said.\n\nThe FBI is also planning to compile Routh's movements in the days and months leading up to the apparent planned attack, according to Veltri, who confirmed Routh was in the vicinity of the golf course for about 12 hours before the Secret Service engaged with him.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nRouth invoked right to lawyer, but family is being interviewed: FBI\n\nFBI agents attempted to interview Routh, but he invoked his constitutional right to a lawyer, according to Veltri, who provided an update at a news conference. Law enforcement has interviewed seven witnesses from the scene of the apparent assassination attempt on Trump, Veltri said.\n\nFBI field offices in Honolulu, Hawaii and Charlotte, North Carolina have also started interviewing Routh's family members, friends, and former colleagues, Veltri said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMar-a-Lago security level 'highest it can possibly be'\n\nSpeaking at an afternoon news conference, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the security level at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club \"is the highest it can possibly be.\"\n\nBradshaw said road closures and checkpoints are in place, and his office would provide the Secret Service with \"every possible resource\" it needs.\n\nBradshaw said he spoke to Trump last night and Trump feels safe.\n\n\"That's important because he is, and what we did yesterday proves that the system can work,\" Bradshaw said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLaw enforcement news conference to livestream\n\nFederal and local law enforcement plan to hold a joint news conference at 4 p.m. edt Monday to provide updates on the investigation into the apparent assassination attempt, according to the Justice Department.\n\nRead more and watch live here.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump to go on X spaces\n\nDonald Trump will presumably discuss the attempted assassination Monday night on X, the Elon Musk-owned social media platform. \"Join me live from Mar-A-Lago at 8:00PM Eastern, tonight on X Spaces,\" Trump said on the website. \"Set a reminder and be sure to tune in!\" No word on whether Musk will join Trump, as he did for a glitch-filled interview in August.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nSecret Service chief lands in Florida as questions swirl\n\nRowe landed in Florida Monday amid questions about how a convicted criminal allegedly pointing an assault-style rifle was able to get within 500 yards of former President Donald Trump before being fired upon by Secret Service agents the day before.\n\nRowe was meeting with local and federal law enforcement officials and doing a walkthrough of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, a Secret Service spokesman said.\n\nThe Secret Service official declined to provide more details about Rowe’s visit, including whether he is in town to oversee an investigation into the agency’s handling of the incident.\n\nBut his trip comes as Democrats and Republicans in Washington called for a probe − even as the Secret Service is still facing criticism for its handling of the shooting at a Trump Pennsylvania campaign rally in July that killed one attendee and injured two others.\n\nThe Secret Service was initially praised Sunday for its quick response to the shooting. In a post on his TruthSocial social media platform, Trump thanked the agency and local law enforcement “for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me … SAFE.”\n\nBut some former Secret Service officials questioned whether more resources, including aerial surveillance drones, could have detected the gunman earlier. And an FBI affidavit released Monday alleged that based on cellphone records, Routh’s mobile phone was at the golf course location for nearly 12 hours, starting at 1:59 a.m.\n\n-Josh Meyer\n\nMerrick Garland pledges to 'work tirelessly to ensure accountability'\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland pledged in a statement Monday that the Justice Department \"will work tirelessly to ensure accountability\" and \"will bring every available resource to bear\" as it investigates the apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nGarland released the statement soon after federal officials' criminal complaint against Routh was made public. Routh is charged with unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and with possessing a firearm that has an obliterated serial number.\n\nThe entire Justice Department – including the FBI, the National Security Division, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida – is working closely with law enforcement partners who are on the ground, Garland said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh fired no shots\n\nDavid Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that Routh did not fire any shots while perched just outside the Trump International Golf Course. No shell casings were found at the site, he said. Prosecutors in his office were developing a motion for pretrial detention with no bail until federal officials informed him they would be taking over the case, Aronberg said.\n\n“We deemed him as a threat to the community,” he said. “We did not want him to slip away.”\n\nAronberg said his office was more concerned about Routh being a danger to the community than a flight risk. “He had an AK-47 style rifle and the allegation was he was pointing it at a law enforcement officer,” he said.\n\n− Rick Jervis\n\nVideo of Routh arrest released\n\nWhen Routh was pulled over by local law enforcement at about 2:14 p.m. Sunday, he was asked whether he knew why he was being stopped and he responded that he did, according to FBI special agent Mark Thomas, who signed an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint against Routh. Video of the stop can be seen here.\n\nThe license plate on the Nissan was registered to a 2012 white Ford truck that had been reported stolen, according to Thomas. A witness who reportedly saw Routh speed off from the Trump golf club area was brought to the scene where Routh was captured and identified him.\n\nRouth's cellphone records indicate he was in the vicinity of the golf course tree line for almost 12 hours Sunday − from 1:59 a.m. until approximately 1:31 p.m.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHours after incident, Trump lobbies donors\n\nDonald Trump has sent another aggressive fund-raising solicitation based on this second assassination attempt, urging supporters to \"fight\" on his behalf.\n\n\"There are people in this world who will do whatever it takes to stop us,\" Trump said after assuring donors that \"I am safe and well, and no one was hurt. Thank God!\"\n\n\"I will not stop fighting for you,\" Trump said. \"I will Never Surrender!\"\n\nTrump posted the fundraising pitch on his Truth Social account with the headline \"Fight, Fight, Fight!!!!!\" Those were the words he used right after the first assassination attempt in July.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nRouth spent itme in Ukraine, wrote book\n\nIn a 291-page self-published book Routh produced in February 2023 on Amazon, titled “Ukraine's Unwinnable War,” Routh unspooled pages of discontent over America’s involvement – or lack thereof – in the Russian-Ukrainian war, as well as urging more military intervention in Taiwan, North Korea and other places. In the book, available only in Kindle version for $2.99, he wrote about traveling to Ukraine in 2022 and how the Ukrainian government refused to let him fight. Instead, according to his account, he set up a protest booth in Kyiv and tried to recruit volunteers to the frontlines.\n\n“It is insanity for many great nations to sit on vast militaries and do nothing as people are killed in countless countries around the globe,” Routh wrote.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Routh's links to Ukraine showed that \"playing with fire\" had consequences, a reference to U.S. support for Ukraine since Russia's invasion.\n\nRouth only makes a few passing references to Trump in the book, criticizing his role in the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol or praising him for trying to spark a relationship with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un. But he harshly criticizes the former president for dismantling the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, taking partial blame for Trump's 2016 election.\n\nSpeaking to Iran's leader, he writes, \"You are free to assassinate Trump as well as me for that error in judgement and the dismantling of the deal.\"\n\n−Rick Jervis\n\nRouth was 'relaxed' when pulled over, taken into custody\n\nThe vehicle Routh was driving was stopped minutes after the incident. Martin County Sheriff William Snyder told CNN Routh was so calm it was “perplexing.\"\n\n“His facial affect was so flat. His demeanor was relaxed,” Snyder said. “I honestly thought it looked like somebody that had just left the church picnic and was on his way home.”\n\nHe was arrested amid a phalanx of law enforcement, including a SWAT team and helicopter. Interstate 95 was briefly shut down, and a bomb dog was brought in. Amid the commotion, Routh said little and never asked why he was pulled over, Snyder said.\n\n“He was just calm, really, as if he was going for dinner,” the sheriff said.\n\nTrump: ‘It was certainly an interesting day!’\n\nThe former president’s first public comment on the incident came in an 11:36 p.m. Truth Social post thanking supporters and praising the Secret Service and law enforcement.\n\n“I would like to thank everyone for your concern and well wishes - It was certainly an interesting day!” He added: “Most importantly, I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE. THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!”\n\nSunday's incident comes as the political atmosphere grows more divisive ahead of the November election. Earlier Sunday, Trump posted \"I hate Taylor Swift\" on his Truth Social platform. And running mate Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, doubled down on a controversial statements about immigrants, saying he had \"no regrets\" for propagating fake stories about Haitians that led to multiple threats against them in the town of Springfield, Ohio\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhat we know about Ryan Routh\n\nRouth was arrested Sunday and had his first court appearance Monday. He appears to be an impassioned supporter of Ukraine in its fight against a Russian invasion and also appeared to have an extensive history of business troubles and court filings.\n\nRouth's social media posts and media interviews form the picture of an impulsive person who said he was willing to risk his life for his ideals – and who made claims that sometimes tested credulity. Besides being a builder and entrepreneur, Routh had told several major media outlets that he worked to recruit soldiers to foreign wars he believed in. A New York Times story in March 2023 that described Routh as a \"former construction worker from Greensboro, N.C.\" said Routh was recruiting Afghan soldiers − who had fled the Taliban − to fight in Ukraine.\n\nOn a phone number associated with Routh, the voicemail greeting as of Sunday identified the number's owner as \"Ryan in Hawaii,\" working with the \"National Volunteer Center, sending soldiers to Ukraine, as well as Taiwan.\" He urged callers to send him a message through WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram or Facebook. Phone calls placed to him were not returned Sunday. Read more here.\n\n− Rick Jervis and Will Carless\n\nHouse panel to set hearing on latest assassination attempt\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and Rep.

Experts say agents in West Palm Beach appeared to have handled the situation properly two months after the Secret Service was heavily criticized following an assassination attempt at an outdoor rally in July, when a gunman with an AR-style rifle shot at the GOP nominee from about 150 yards away.\n\nBut the recent incident at one of Trump's golf clubs in Florida underscores the challenges in protecting a presidential candidate who likes to keep a high public profile – including hitting the links and holding outdoor rallies, those experts told USA TODAY.

A lone gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, 20, opened fire at a crowded rally in Western Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump's ear and he was rushed off stage by U.S. Secret Service after at least six shots rang out. One spectator was killed and two others were critically wounded. Crooks, perched on the roof of an adjoining warehouse, was killed by a Secret Service sniper returning fire.\n\nThe incident drew a firestorm of criticism and questions, including how Crooks managed to get within about 150 yards of Trump despite Secret Service protection.

He said his prosecutors were preparing an arrest warrant and pretrial detention for Routh when federal prosecutors told him they were taking over the case, so he backed off.\n\nAronberg also said an AK-47 rifle believed to belong to Routh was recovered at the scene. Aronberg said Routh appeared to be at least partly motivated by his strong support for Ukraine and its war against Russia. “He’s someone who obviously has some issues,” he said. \"Normal people don’t commit crimes like this.\"\n\nPublic records indicate a man of that age named Ryan Routh lived in Hawaii, but voting records showed the same man as a longtime voter in North Carolina. State voting records show him casting ballots in general and municipal elections going back many cycles, including 2008 and 2012 − though not in 2016, when Trump first ran.\n\nThe same records show Routh voted most recently in the March primary election this year in Guilford County, North Carolina.

Wire\n\nGun experts scrutinize gunman’s Soviet-style rifle\n\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw showed photos from the scene of what he said was an assassination attempt depicting a rifle, backpack, and GoPro camera.\n\nHe described the firearm as an AK-style rifle — a ubiquitous semi-automatic rifle designed with a curved detachable 30-round magazine. Firearms experts were quick Sunday to point out some of the features in the grainy photo suggest the rifle is a Soviet cousin to the AK, the SKS. It was designed in the 1940s by another famous Russian designer, Sergey Simonov.\n\nThe SKS was a slightly older rifle than the AKs with replicas sold worldwide in the civilian market. Traditionally, the SKS came with a 10-round \"fixed magazine\" a distinguishing feature from the detachable, curved 30-round magazines on AKs.\n\nThe wooded scene photos showed a black \"sporterized\" modern SKS, with a detachable magazine. It had a scope added for longer-range shooting and appeared to have a \"Monte Carlo\" stock to fit better to a shooter’s cheek.\n\nFirearms experts at The Military Wire called the weapon a 7.62x39mm SKS rifle with black synthetic stock. That’s the same ammunition as most AKs.\n\nNotably, an SKS was used in the 2017 Congressional baseball game shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a police officer, aide, and lobbyist.\n\nSome firearms experts called the weapon an \"eclectic\" and odd choice. Other gun lobby groups pointed out Sunday the weapon would not be covered by a so-called assault weapons ban since it had no foregrip, pistol grip, or detachable stock which have been targeted by the proposal as distinguishing features.\n\n-- Nick Penzenstadler\n\nTrump campaign sends email about assassination attempt with fundraising link\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign sent an email Sunday evening touching on the assassination attempt against the former president earlier in the day.

That's how we got the guy.”\n\n“We started out with ‘We don't know anything’ to where we had a tag, we had a vehicle description, and we got an area where we saw the person,” Bradshaw said. “So be proud. Be proud of your law enforcement.”\n\n--Josh Meyer\n\nOfficials: Secret Service engaged gunman, AK-47 style weapon found\n\nU.S. Secret Service agents opened fire on a gunman located near the property line of the golf source after seeing a rifle, according to law enforcement officials who spoke at a press conference Sunday afternoon.\n\nAgents found an AK-47 styled rifle, a scope, backpack and a GoPro camera on the scene, officials said. Trump was on the golf course at the time, and was roughly 400 to 500 yards away from where the would-be assailant was.\n\nThe suspect is now in custody, officials said.\n\nWitness: 'I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag'\n\nA witness saw the alleged gunman running from the golf course bushes and took a picture of his vehicle that led to the suspect’s quick apprehension, the Palm Beach County sheriff said at Sunday's news conference.\n\n“We are able to catch a witness that came to us and said, ‘Hey, I saw the guy running out of the bushes, he jumped into a black Nissan and I took a picture of the vehicle and the tag,’ which was great,” Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said.\n\nAs a result, they were able to alert the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, who detained the suspect. The witness also was able to then identify the alleged gunman.\n\nWho was Trump golfing with?\n\nBefore the shooting began Trump was golfing with longtime friend and real estate baron Steven Witkoff, according to multiple reports.\n\nWitkoff gave a heartfelt speech about Trump at the Republican convention in Milwaukee back in August. He said he reached out to the former president after the assassination attempt in July, and was surprised when Trump picked up.\n\n\"I know this man very well,\" Witkoff said. \"President Trump is as kind and compassionate a man as I've ever met my lifetime.\"\n\nTrump: 'I am safe and well'\n\nIn a fundraising email sent out roughly an hour after the incident, Trump said there were gunshots in his vicinity, \"but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I am safe and well!\"\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity has developed a close relationship with Trump and conveyed having a brief conversation with the GOP nominee on Sunday. He joined a live broadcast after speaking with the former president.\n\nTrump checked to see if others were OK, Hannity said, but then joked about wanting to finish the round.\n\n\"I guess in typical, 'fight, fight, fight' fashion Trump said... 'I really wanted to finish the hole,'\" Hannity said.\n\nWhen was Donald Trump last attacked?\n\nThis incident occurred two months after the former president was injured in an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on July 13. That incident sparked an investigation and caused the resignation of then Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, who had led the agency since 2022.\n\nIn the subsequent weeks, Trump has increased security at his events with him often speaking behind bulletproof glass at outdoor rallies.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/17/donald-trump-talks-auto-industry-and-nuclear-war-in-flint/75260833007/", "title": "In Flint, former President Donald Trump talks a ruined auto industry ...", "text": "FLINT — Appearing in this Democratic stronghold and old industrial center, former President Donald Trump on Tuesday night made a series of dire and bold predictions, promising to close down the southern border on his first day if he returns to office, save the auto industry from what he called certain ruin and stave off nuclear war.\n\n\"The whole world is blowing up,\" said Trump, speaking at the Dort Financial Center in Flint to a capacity crowd of 6,000 people or more just two days after Secret Service agents foiled an apparent assassination attempt against the Republican former president in Florida and 50 days before the Nov. 5 election between him and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile the hour-long event was labeled a town hall, which suggested a series of interactions between Trump and members of the audience, instead only three people asked questions along with those from the host − Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was Trump's White House press secretary. In his answers, Trump acknowledged he often gives \"long, sometimes very complex sentences and paragraphs but they all come together.\"\n\n\"That’s not rambling, that’s genius when you connect the dots,\" he said.\n\nMore:Rhetoric 'put a giant target' on Trump, Vance says after second assassination attempt\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:It's National Voter Registration Day: Here's how and where to register to vote in Michigan\n\nHere are some of the highlights from Trump's remarks, with some context added where needed:\n\n∎ Regarding the apparent assassination plot in Florida, for which a suspect was arrested without his firing a shot, as well as the assassination attempt against the former president in Butler, Pa., in July, Trump said, \"You know, only consequential presidents get shot at.\"\n\n∎ Speaking of Michigan's predominant place in the domestic auto industry, he said if reelected he would place higher tariffs on foreign imports, especially those from China, and said Michigan would have more auto plants than during any time in the last 50 years. \"If I don’t win you will have no auto industry within two to three years,\" he said. When Trump was president, Michigan lost auto jobs even before the COVID-19 shutdowns.\n\n∎ When one audience member asked Trump what needed to be done to protect the auto industry, Trump veered into a dire warning about the threat of nuclear war and downplayed the threat of climate change, saying the world is cooling.\n\n\"It (a nuclear attack) is the single biggest threat to the world, not only Michigan to the world, and you're not going to care so much about making cars, if that stuff starts happening.\" While some leaders say the threat of nuclear war is higher than in the recent past, it's also true that the world has been warming, not getting cooler, for decades.\n\nTrump also said he would start his first day back in office by responding to increases in recent years in illegal immigration by closing the southern border, despite a current policy that has substantially reduced the number of people being allowed into the U.S. and a move if attempted which is certain to spark lawsuits to block him, and increasing oil production as a way to lower gas prices and transportation costs overall. In 2023, the U.S. produced more oil than in any year when Trump was president.\n\nTrump continued to blast the U.S. economy, saying it was \"not good,\" but the job creation has been up throughout President Joe Biden's term in office, as has the stock market. Inflation rates were high, however, for years following the COVID shutdowns, though they have been coming down in recent months.\n\nThe former president also had kind words for Elon Musk, a supporter and founder of electric car maker Tesla, saying Musk \"loves your state,\" even though Tesla has no Michigan operations despite its connection with the auto industry and has been accused by the UAW of trying to intimidate workers' efforts to unionize.\n\nIt was Trump's ninth visit to Michigan this year and his first to Genesee County, where he lost by about 9 percentage points to President Joe Biden in 2020 and by a similar margin to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, when he narrowly won Michigan and the presidency.\n\nPolls show a close election between Trump and Harris both nationally and in Michigan, which is considered a key battleground state. Harris is due in metro Detroit on Thursday for an event before a small audience with Oprah Winfrey to be telecast online. Democrats and the Harris campaign have been arguing that Trump's proposed tariffs will result in far higher prices and exacerbate inflation and that he cannot be trusted to protect reproductive rights; during the event Tuesday, Trump said it's Harris who wants to raise taxes that will hurt middle class Americans and businesses.\n\n“Under Donald Trump’s watch, Michigan lost 280,000 jobs as he handed out tax giveaways to billionaires and corporations. A second Trump term would be even worse – raising costs on Michigan families by nearly $4,000 a year, crushing auto jobs, and ceding Michigan’s global auto manufacturing leadership to the Chinese government,\" said U.S. Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan. \"The only candidate in this race who understands working families is Vice President Harris, who has a plan to lower costs, bring good-paying manufacturing jobs back home and ensure Michigan workers continue to lead the world in auto manufacturing.\"\n\nOutside, some Trump supporters waited many hours to see him at the Dort Financial Center, which seats about 4,000 people for hockey and about 6,000 for concerts and was rapidly filling ahead of Trump's scheduled 7 p.m. appearance.\n\nJudy Tidball of the village of Genesee and Linda Bain of Davison, both retired nurses, weren't sure they would make it to the front of the line after arriving shortly before 4 p.m. They said they are huge Trump fans and they were anxious to see him speak in person, for the first time.\n\nBain said she thought Trump did a great job as president and she would have great fears for the future of the nation if Harris was elected president.\n\nTidball said she's been hurt by high grocery prices since Biden took office and is also concerned about large numbers of undocumented immigrants crossing the border. \"I'm all for immigration, but it has to be legal,\" Tidball said.\n\nInside the building electronic messages reading \"Trump was right,\" and \"Vote Trump for No Tax on Tips,\" ringed the heights of the arena.\n\nRod Swanson, who lives in the Clio area and is a semi-retired salesman, said he is looking forward to what he hopes will be a \"third Trump term\" after the Nov. 5 election.\n\n\"I feel it (will be) his third term because the media suggest that everything that's happened the last four years has been Trump's fault,\" Swanson said.\n\n\"Kamala has no experience of any sort and President Trump has,\" he said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spoke with a few hundred supporters at Apple Valley Estates in Sparta, a small community north of Grand Rapids.\n\nWhile Vance continued to hit Harris for what he described as failures in dealing with inflation and the U.S. southern border with Mexico, a sizeable chunk of his comments focused on a Sunday assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nVance said Democratic leaders and the mainstream media have not done enough to tone down rhetoric on the campaign trail in the weeks since the first assassination attempt against Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July.\n\nThat was before Sunday’s thwarted attempt, when Secret Service agents opened fire after spotting a gun barrel in the bushes at Trump International Golf Club in Florida, causing the gunman to flee before he was arrested in a nearby county later that day.\n\nSuspect Ryan Routh, who appeared in federal court Monday, never fired a shot, authorities said. He was being held on charges of possession of a firearm while a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, USA Today reported.\n\nVance called for Trump to have the same level of security detail as President Joe Biden, telling supporters that \"assassinations destroy the social fabric of this country.\" Biden said Monday that the Secret Service needed more resources, and he encouraged Congress to provide them.\"If people had taken an attempt on Kamala Harris' life, I would be looking in the mirror and saying 'how can we do a lot better?' But here we are, two people have now tried to assassinate Donald Trump, and all the media can talk about is we need more censorship? And they're still talking about Donald Trump like he's a threat that needs to be eliminated? They haven't learned a damn thing, and they're going to get somebody killed.\"\n\nContact Paul Egan: 517-372-8660 or pegan@freepress.com.

As we learn more details about this horrifying incident, let us pray that all those in attendance at the former President’s rally today are unharmed.\"\n\n--Rachel Barber\n\nApparent shooting raises questions about Republican convention\n\nThe shocking moment also immediately raised questions about security at the Republican convention, set to begin next week. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said in a post on X that the Secret Service \"needs to come out ASAP and let us know how this happened and how everyone at the RNC and DNC conventions will be safe.\"\n\nTexas official says he heard as many as eight shots\n\nTexas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller was in the front row at the rally in rural Pennsylvania and said he heard as many as eight shots, and saw a woman nearby who appeared to have been struck by gunfire.\n\n\"At first, I didn't know what it was,\" Miller told the American-Statesman by phone from the outdoor venue. \"Then I heard 'pop! pop!,' and knew it was gunfire. Everybody got down but I stayed standing up to try to see what was going on.\"\n\nMiller said that he was not harmed and did not know the condition of the woman who appeared to have been hit.\n\n− John Moritz\n\nContributing: USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/07/16/trump-shooting-investigation-updates-secret-service/74420646007/", "title": "Trump shooting updates: Officer spotted gunman before rampage", "text": "BETHEL PARK, Pa. − A local police officer was hoisted by his partner to the roof of the building where he spotted a gunman moments before the start of the deadly shooting at former President Donald Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, a local law enforcement official said Tuesday.\n\nButler County Sheriff Michael Slupe told Reuters the gunman, later identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, saw the officer and pointed his rifle at him before the officer, holding to the roof's edge, dropped down to safety. Slupe, who said the officer was unable to use his gun under the circumstances, said Crooks quickly opened fire toward Trump, who was speaking in the Butler Farm Show grounds about 150 yards away on Saturday.\n\nTrump was wounded, one attendee was killed, and two others were critically wounded. Secret Service snipers then fatally shot Crooks, the agency's director has said. The Secret Service issued a statement Tuesday saying the agency was \"deeply grateful\" to local police officers for their efforts — and denied blaming local authorities for the attack.\n\nIn an interview Monday on ABC News, Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said local police had been in the building and were \"responsible for the outer perimeter of the building.\" The statement drew criticism from Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, who said all officers at the scene acted \"heroically.\"\n\n\"This is a failure at the management or command level who failed to secure an obvious weakness in the security of this event,\" Yoes said in a statement.\n\nThe Secret Service, in a statement early Tuesday, appeared to walk back the blame.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to the officers who ran toward danger to locate the gunman and to all our local partners for their unwavering commitment,\" the agency's statement read. \"Any news suggesting the Secret Service is blaming local law enforcement for Saturday's incident is simply not true.\"\n\nBiden rejects accusations in interview:Biden denies using violent anti-Trump rhetoric\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ A man was shot and killed by out-of-town police officers about a mile from the site of the National Republican Convention in Milwaukee, outside the event's security perimeter, the USA TODAY Network reported Tuesday. A witness said the officers were trying to break up a fight.\n\n∎ Nearly two-thirds of Republican voters − 65% − say Trump surviving the assassination attempt indicates divine intervention or God's will, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The same survey showed 80% of registered voters believe the country is spiraling out of control.\n\n∎ Three snipers from local tactical teams, deployed to assist the Secret Service, were stationed inside the building from which Crooks opened fire Saturday, a local law enforcement officer with direct knowledge of the incident told CBS News.\n\n∎ A video posted from the rally to social media shows civilians calling out to police that someone was on the roof moments before the shooting started. Cheatle said \"a very short period of time\" passed between then and when Crooks began shooting.\n\n∎ The Republican National Convention entered its second day Tuesday, one day after Trump made his first public appearance since the shooting.\n\nReported Iran plot to kill Trump appears unrelated to Saturday shooting\n\nThe Secret Service boosted protection for Trump after learning about an Iranian plot to kill him before Saturday's assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania, which appears to be unrelated, sources told USA TODAY.\n\nOnce the threat was ascertained, the White House confirmed with the Secret Service at a senior level that they were continuing to track the latest reporting, according to a national security official who was not authorized to speak publicly. The Trump campaign was made aware of “an evolving threat,” the official said, and the Secret Service surged resources and assets to protect Trump.\n\nThe revelation raises further questions about how Saturday's gunman could have reached a position to shoot Trump under what was supposed to be enhanced security. Law enforcement authorities have not identified ties between the shooting and any foreign adversaries, according to a statement Tuesday from the National Security Council.\n\nIran's United Nations mission called the plot accusations \"unsubstantiated and malicious.\"\n\n− Tom Vanden Brook\n\nFormer agent calls out Secret Service mistakes\n\nKenneth Valentine, a former Secret Service special agent in charge, told Reuters the agency responsible for protecting Trump should have had personnel surveilling rooftops and in a position to neutralize any threats.\n\nValentine also said the Secret Service should have identified the building from where Crooks shot − about 500 feet from where Trump spoke − as a security risk.\n\n\"He shouldn’t have been able to get up on the roof,\" Valentine said.\n\nTrump schedules rally for a week after shooting\n\nThe Trump campaign has scheduled a rally for Saturday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, one week after he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. Trump and running mate JD Vance will appear in Van Andel Arena on Saturday afternoon, the campaign announced.\n\nTrump, who was nicked in the right ear by a bullet in Saturday's shooting, will give his nomination acceptance speech Thursday night in Milwaukee.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nVictim sustained 'life-altering injuries,' family says\n\nThe family of James Copenhaver, one of the two victims injured while attending the Trump rally, issued a statement Tuesday thanking first responders and those who have provided him with medical treatment since the shooting.\n\nThe statement said Copenhaver, a 74-year-old Pennsylvania resident, sustained \"life-altering injuries\" in the attack and is in critical but stable condition at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. The family also asked for privacy as Copenhaver recovers.\n\nCrooks reportedly bought ladder before shooting\n\nHours before the shooting, Crooks stopped at a Home Depot in his hometown of Bethel Park and purchased a ladder, CNN and NBC reported, citing unnamed law enforcement officials.\n\nSeveral rallygoers reported to local officers before the shooting that Crooks was acting suspiciously and was climbing a ladder, according to a law enforcement official who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation.\n\nIn a statement shared with USA TODAY, Home Depot deferred to law enforcement but condemned the shooting.\"The best source of information on this is law enforcement. We condemn the violence against former President Trump, and our thoughts are with him, the other victims of Saturday's horrific events, and their families,\" the statement said.\n\nNeighbor of shooter stunned by tragedy\n\nOfficers with the Bethel Park Police Department on Tuesday continued blocking access to the street where the Crooks family home sits. The FBI has said the family has been cooperating with the investigation.\n\nLate Monday, someone stepped out of the house, got into a red SUV parked in the driveway, and left as photographers hurried to capture a photo. Some neighbors who live within a block of the Crooks said they’re still in disbelief that one of their neighbors tried to assassinate Trump.\n\nVanessa Ovesney, 17, said it was a surprise to see the shooter was someone who had grown up in the peaceful suburb about an hour from where the shooting took place. She said Crooks looked familiar but that she couldn’t recall any interactions with him, though she had passed his house countless times.\"It’s unfortunate because we don’t know what was going on with him exactly,\" she said.\n\nMemorial Thursday for shooting victim Corey Comperatore\n\nFriends and loved ones of the former volunteer fire chief who was fatally shot at Trump's rally can pay their respects at a memorial Thursday, the family of Corey Comperatore announced.\n\nComperatore, 50, was a \"hero\" who dived to protect his wife and daughter when the shooting started, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said. An obituary released Monday says the father of two daughters was an engineer, a 10-year veteran of the U.S. Army Reserves, and a \"man of God.\"\n\n\"Above all, Corey was the quintessential family man and the best girl dad,\" the obituary says, adding that \"Corey's legacy is not just in the major milestones he achieved but in the small acts of kindness that marked his everyday life.\"\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nHigh anxiety:Can Trump and Biden lead us out of the moment we're in now?\n\nGunman's motive eludes investigators\n\nAuthorities have yet to reveal a motive for the shooting. Despite scouring Crooks’ phone and computer search activity, authorities have been unable to determine why Crooks, a 20-year-old dietary aid at a nursing home with no criminal record, acted as he did.\n\nInterviews with family and friends have turned up no obvious motive, law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nCrooks would have been eligible to cast his first presidential vote in the Nov. 5 election. Public records reflect a mixed political background, as Crooks was a registered Republican who a few years ago made a $15 donation to a Democratic Party cause.\n\nRecords also show his father is a registered Republican and his mother a registered Democrat.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/politics/fact-check-capitol-insurrection-january-6-lies/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 5 enduring lies about Capitol insurrection | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Capitol insurrection was based on a lie about the 2020 election. And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about.\n\nDonald Trump supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.\n\nThey have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a “protest” against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nThey have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as “political prisoners.”\n\nHere is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were completely unarmed\n\nTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.\n\nIn a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a “completely unarmed protest.” Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, “One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don’t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed – and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far “over 75” people charged in connection to the attack “have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.”\n\nWe may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.\n\nMark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, “you’d be here for another reason.”\n\nGuy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt “specifically targeted at least two lawmakers – the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell – whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.” And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were merely protesting a ‘rigged’ election\n\nTrump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a “wild” protest against President Joe Biden’s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to “fight like hell.”\n\nAfter the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months – and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the “real insurrection” was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a “day of protesting.” (He also made similar claims later in the year.)\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn’t rigged and wasn’t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden’s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 – in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted – involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\n\n“This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: “The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.”\n\nLie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police\n\nA common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nTrump said in a book interview in March that “the Capitol Police were ushering people in” and “the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.” The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack “were invited in by Capitol Police.”\n\nFacts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.\n\nRioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThere are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building.\n\nSince we don’t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it’s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal “conduct unbecoming” that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations.\n\nBut no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it’s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: “The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.”\n\nLie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners\n\nOne of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become “political prisoners” while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.\n\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement “are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals” but are “political prisoners who are now being persecuted”; he suggested that there are “nearly 200” nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September’s “Justice for J6” rally said its event was meant “to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.”\n\nFacts First: This “political prisoners” narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups.\n\nIt’s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it’s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden’s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.\n\nA few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\n\nLie: January 6 was a false flag attack\n\nBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame – claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence.\n\nSuch “false flag” theories – that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump’s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad – never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.” Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): “It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.”\n\nAnd Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, “You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.”\n\nFacts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to “fight like hell” and to march to the Capitol. The rioters’ allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews.\n\nThough there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters – and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.\n\nCarlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI – The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant – the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated “false flag” operation.\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by “deep state” liberals trying to set up Trump supporters.\n\n“It’s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example. It’s un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies,” Cheney said.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Marshall Cohen", "Daniel Dale", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/us/payton-gendron-buffalo-shooting-suspect-what-we-know/index.html", "title": "Payton Gendron: What we know about the Buffalo supermarket ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe 18-year-old man who allegedly shot and killed 10 people Saturday afternoon in Buffalo, New York, was motivated by hate, authorities said, targeting a supermarket in the heart of a predominantly Black community.\n\nEleven of the 13 people shot by the White suspect at the Tops Friendly Market were Black, officials said. Among the victims, who range in age from 20 to 86, were people grocery shopping, a heroic former police officer who tried to stop the gunman, a long-term substitute teacher and a taxi driver who “took pride in helping people.”\n\n“This was pure evil,” Erie County Sheriff John Garcia said, calling the shooting a “straight-up racially motivated hate crime from somebody outside of our community.”\n\nThe US Department of Justice is investigating the shooting “as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism,” according to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nPayton S. Gendron of Conklin, New York, has been charged with first-degree murder, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a May 14 news release. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nOn June 1, a grand jury returned a 25-count indictment against Gendron. He is facing 10 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of second-degree murder as a hate crime and three counts of attempted murder as a hate crime, according to court documents. Gendron is also facing a charge of domestic terror and a weapons charge, according to court documents.\n\nGendron pleaded not guilty to the 25-count indictment, his attorney said in court Thursday afternoon.\n\nGendron’s defense attorney told CNN on May 17 he would not issue a statement now.\n\nHere’s what we know about the suspect.\n\nHe planned to ‘continue his rampage,’ police say\n\nWhen the suspect arrived at the store around 2:30 p.m., he was heavily armed, wearing tactical gear – including a tactical helmet along with plated armor, Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said – and had a camera that was livestreaming his actions.\n\nHe used an assault weapon, Flynn said during a news conference.\n\nThe suspect shot four people outside of the grocery store, three fatally, Flynn said in his news release. When he entered the store, he exchanged fire with an armed security guard, who authorities said was a retired Buffalo police officer. The security guard died of his injuries. The suspect shot eight more people in the store, six of whom died, the release said.\n\nConfronted by police, the suspected shooter took off some of his tactical gear and surrendered, per Buffalo police.\n\nThe suspect planned to continue his shooting rampage beyond the Tops supermarket, Gramaglia told CNN on Monday, saying there was “some documentation” he allegedly planned to target “another large superstore.”\n\n“There was evidence that was uncovered that he had plans, had he gotten out of here, to continue his rampage and continue shooting people,” he said.\n\nThe suspect made very disturbing statements describing his motive and state of mind following his arrest, an official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Those statements were clear and filled with hate toward the Black community, with the alleged shooter making it known he was targeting Black people, the official said.\n\nThe alleged shooter was “studying” previous hate attacks and shootings, investigators have learned via search warrants and other methods.\n\nThe suspect was in Buffalo on Friday, the day before the shooting, per Gramaglia, who said he was doing reconnaissance at the store.\n\nShonnell Harris Teague, an operations manager at the store, saw him Friday afternoon at the store and told him to leave because it appeared he was bothering customers, she told ABC News.\n\nHarris Teague saw the suspect sitting on a bench outside with a camper bag on his back, wearing the same camouflage clothing he wore Saturday, she told ABC. After being asked to leave, he did so without argument, she said.\n\nHer brother, the Rev. Tim Newkirk, backed up the account, noting the suspect “was in there posing as a beggar and was looking for change,” he told The Buffalo News.\n\n“She had to politely escort him out. They have a no peddling policy in the Tops, no panhandling,” Newkirk said, “so she was just letting him know that this was not the place where you do that.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Buffalo pastor on shooting: We have to resist the impulse to forget 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\nHe spent months plotting his attack, social media posts show\n\nGendron is believed to have visited Buffalo in early March, Gramaglia said Monday, citing the suspect’s “digital footprint.” Social media posts analyzed by CNN reveal the suspect visited the Tops store in March and had been extensively planning his attack for several months up until the day of the shooting.\n\nAccording to the posts – which Gendron originally shared on Discord, then on the hate-filled online forum 4Chan – the suspect drove March 8 to the supermarket in Buffalo.\n\nThe posts were made visible to a small group of people about 30 minutes before the shooting began, according to a statement from Discord.\n\nGendron wrote in the posts that he went into Tops Market three times during his visit: at 12 p.m., 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. He wrote about activity inside the store each time he went in – noting how many Black and White people were in the market and also drawing a map of the inside of the store.\n\nDuring his 4 p.m. visit, Gendron was approached by a “Black armed security guard” who asked the suspect what he was doing going in and out of the store, he wrote. The shooter told the security guard he was collecting “consensus data,” according to the posts.\n\n“In hindsight that was a close call,” Gendron wrote.\n\nIn a post on March 10, Gendron wrote, “I’m going to have to kill that security guard at Tops I hope he doesn’t kill me or even hurt me instantly.”\n\nThe shooter wrote about how he planned his attack for March 15 but then delayed it several times.\n\nIn the posts, Gendron cites online research in choosing Buffalo as his site of attack – saying the 14208 ZIP code in Buffalo has a higher Black population than the other locations he was considering.\n\nThe shooter considered attacking a church or an elementary school but ultimately chose the supermarket because of the number of people that go to grocery stores, he wrote.\n\nHe referred to Google’s “popular times” graph for the Tops Friendly Market in determining the time he would plan his attack – so the grocery store would be busiest.\n\nDiscord said that a “private, invite-only server” was created by the suspect and that “approximately 30 minutes prior to the attack,” a small group of people was invited to and joined the server.\n\n“Before that, our records indicate no other people saw the diary chat log in this private server,” it said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families,” the company said. “Hate has no place on Discord and we are committed to combating violence and extremism. We are continuing to do everything we can to assist law enforcement and the investigation remains ongoing.”\n\nCNN asked the Discord spokesperson when the company became aware of Gendron’s posts and if any of the individuals who were invited to view his private server alerted moderators to the content but did not receive an immediate response.\n\nCNN also reached out to 4Chan asking about Gendron’s posts being shared on the platform but has not heard back.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It is White supremacy': CNN speaks to son of Buffalo massacre victim 03:06 - Source: CNN\n\nDocument talks about ‘dwindling size’ of White population\n\nInvestigators are sifting for clues in a 180-page document attributed to Gendron and posted online, Flynn said. The purported “manifesto” allegedly was written by the suspect, officials have said.\n\n“We are obviously going through that with a fine-toothed comb and reviewing that for all evidence that may lead us to besides the manifesto itself,” prosecutor Flynn told CNN.\n\n“All the evidence that we ascertain from that manifesto, from wherever that manifesto leads us, other pieces of evidence we already had, we can then use that and develop more charges potentially,” he added.\n\nThe document, independently obtained by CNN shortly after the attack and before authorities released the suspect’s name, is allegedly written by a person claiming to be Payton Gendron confessing to the attack.\n\nThe author attributes the internet for most of his beliefs and describes himself as a fascist, a White supremacist and an anti-Semite.\n\nThe author bought ammo for some time but didn’t get serious about planning the attack until January, per the document. The author also writes about his perceptions of the dwindling size of the White population and claims of ethnic and cultural replacement of Whites.\n\nThe suspect allegedly chose to attack the Tops store in Buffalo because it was in a majority-Black ZIP code within driving distance of where he lived, and he researched what time it would be busiest, according to the document.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Stelter: Shooting is 'replacement theory' rearing its ugly head again 05:04 - Source: CNN\n\nHe’s from a town hours away from Buffalo\n\nThe ZIP code that includes the store, 14208, is 78% Black – the highest percentage of Black population of any ZIP code in upstate New York – per the Census Bureau’s 2020 American Community Survey. Conklin, where the suspect is from, is a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Buffalo.\n\nGendron’s parents were not known to hold extremist views, according to two New York residents who have worked with his parents at the state Department of Transportation and who shared their views on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\n“I never thought of the family as racist or hateful,” said one coworker, who said she was heartbroken for the victims’ families as well as Payton’s parents, Pam and Paul. “I can’t wrap my head around this tragedy.”\n\nPayton Gendron talks with his attorney during his arraignment Saturday in Buffalo City Court. Mark Mulville/AP\n\nGendron was a worker at the local Conklin Reliable Market for about four months before he left about three months ago, the store’s owner said, adding he was very quiet and left on his own terms, giving two weeks’ notice.\n\nGendron’s mother regularly would walk in the neighborhood, neighbors said. She was a nice woman, one said, adding they “never would have thought that in a million years” Gendron would have racist views. “It’s pretty shocking,” the neighbor added.\n\nWhen you talked to Payton Gendron, “you wouldn’t get more than a word or two” from him, another neighbor said.\n\nGendron’s former classmates said while he could sometimes be a loner and “odd,” he wasn’t known to be violent.\n\n“I just don’t understand what convinced him to do this,” said Bryce Gibbs, who said he attended elementary through high school with Gendron and described him as “nice.”\n\nHe made ‘generalized threat’ at high school\n\nGendron made a “generalized threat” in June while he attended Susquehanna Valley Central High School in Conklin, Gramaglia said Sunday, adding the threat was not racially motivated.\n\nState police took the student for a mental health evaluation, Gramaglia said at a Buffalo news conference. After a day and a half, he was released.\n\nThe suspect was visited last year by New York State Police after he did a high school project about murder-suicides, Garcia told CNN on Monday. Concerns about alleged mental health issues “were brought to light” after he turned in the post-graduation project, the sheriff said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm sad, I'm hurt, I'm mad': Buffalo reacts to racially motivated shooting 01:25 - Source: CNN\n\nState police spokesperson Beau Duffy said that on June 8, 2021, state police officers responded to the high school to investigate a report that a 17-year-old student made a threatening statement. The student was taken into custody under NYS Mental Health Law section 9.41 and transported to a hospital for a mental health evaluation.\n\nDuffy confirmed it was an evaluation and not an involuntary commitment – so it would not have prevented the suspected shooter from purchasing or possessing a gun under federal law.\n\nState police were unable to confirm how long the person was in the hospital or the findings of the evaluation. The agency also refused to name the then-17-year-old.\n\nThe suspect addressed the incident in posts on Discord later shared on 4Chan, writing in a post-dated January 30 that he “had to go to a hospital’s ER because I said the word’s ‘murder/suicide’ to an online paper in economics class.”\n\n“I got out of it,” the suspect claims, “because I stuck with the story that I was getting out of class and I just stupidly wrote that down. That is the reason I believe I am still able to purchase guns.”\n\n“It was not a joke,” the post reads, “I wrote that down because that’s what I was planning to do.”\n\nThe suspect goes on to claim his mental health evaluation lasted only 15 minutes after he spent hours waiting in the emergency room. CNN has reached out to New York State police about this account.\n\nBroome County District Attorney Michael Korchak, the district attorney in the suspect’s hometown, is reviewing “all aspects” of last year’s investigation into the threat and also “going back several years” to understand the suspected shooter’s behavior and relationships with family, teachers and other students.\n\nBut it’s “hard to say” whether more should have been done in June, Korchak told CNN.\n\n“Unfortunately this is nothing new in the criminal justice system,” Korchak said. “Individuals that have mental health issues may have it under control for a period of time, and then one day they just snap and things as tragic as this happen.”\n\nInvestigators are talking to the suspect’s parents and they are being cooperative, Korchak said.\n\nGun was legally purchased, governor says\n\nThe gun used in the mass shooting was purchased legally in New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN earlier, describing the weapon as an AR-15. It’s believed the high-capacity magazine was purchased out of state, the governor added.\n\nIn addition to the AR-15, Gendron had a rifle and a shotgun in his car, Gramaglia said. The online diatribe attributed to Gendron said he planned to bring those same three types of guns with him that day.\n\nHere’s how the suspect legally obtained guns\n\nThe “main firearm” Gendron planned to use was a Bushmaster XM-15 assault rifle that he bought from Vintage Firearms, a gun store in Endicott, New York, before “illegally modifying it,” according to the diatribe. Gendron passed a background check before he bought the gun and he didn’t stick out among his other customers, Vintage Firearms owner, Robert Donald, told The New York Times; no one at the store has responded to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nGendron also bought a Mossberg 500 shotgun from Pennsylvania Guns and Ammo, a store in Great Bend, about a 10-minute drive across the state border from his hometown of Conklin, the racist document attributed to him states.\n\nThe suspect passed a background check at the store and legally purchased the shotgun in December 2021, the store owner, who did not want his name used, told CNN. The shotgun was not used in Saturday’s shooting.\n\nThe third gun was a Savage Axis XP rifle that Gendron’s father bought for him for Christmas in 2020 “so that I could go hunting without borrowing my cousin’s guns,” the document states.\n\nThe racist statement also says the shooter planned to use the shotgun and rifle to shoot other Black people on the street as he drove away from the supermarket.\n\nCNN obtained a photo of two long guns allegedly brought to the scene. The photo was confirmed by two law enforcement sources.\n\nA photo of two long guns allegedly found in the suspect's car, according to law enforcement sources. CNN\n\nThe image shows the weapons inside a car, which was found by law enforcement after the suspect’s arrest, according to one of the law enforcement sources. The weapons were not used in the shooting. Writing appears all over the weapons, including the phrase “White Lives Matter” and names including what appears to be the name of a victim of a crime allegedly committed by a Black suspect.\n\nOther notations seized by investigators reflect the racist beliefs of the shooter, as well as his obsession with mass killing, according to a law enforcement source.\n\nHe allegedly livestreamed on Twitch\n\nThe shooting suspect used the popular livestreaming platform Twitch to stream a live broadcast during the attack, the company confirmed Saturday.\n\nThe company was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, it said, adding the user “has been indefinitely suspended from our service, and we are taking all appropriate action, including monitoring for any accounts rebroadcasting this content.”\n\nCNN obtained a portion of the livestream showing the alleged shooter pulling up to a Tops store.\n\nThe video is recorded from the point of view of the alleged shooter as he drives into the supermarket’s parking lot. The person is seen in the rearview mirror wearing a helmet and is heard saying, “Just got to go for it,” before he pulls into the front of the store.\n\nIn the video, store patrons can be seen walking through the parking lot as the suspect drives up.\n\nThe company removed the livestream less than two minutes after the violence started, a spokesperson for Twitch said. The company did not immediately respond to follow-up questions about whether the suspect was firing when the livestream was halted.\n\nHe will likely face more charges\n\nThe suspect pleaded not guilty to one count of first-degree murder Saturday evening before Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah, according to the judge and the district attorney’s news release. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole, the release said.\n\nGendron’s attorney’s request for a mental health forensic examination was withdrawn, Flynn said. Gendron remains on suicide watch, Garcia said, and in custody without bail.\n\nThere may be more charges coming, officials said.\n\n“My office is working closely with the US Attorney’s Office and our partners in law enforcement into potential terrorism and hate crimes. This is an active investigation and additional charges may be filed,” Flynn said.\n\nGendron is set to return to court Thursday morning for a felony hearing, the release said.\n\nHe is likely the “most highly visible incarcerated individual” in the country, Garcia told CNN on Monday. There are video cameras in his cell, and he remains under a sheriff’s deputy’s watch at all times.", "authors": ["Shimon Prokupecz Christina Maxouris Dakin Andone Samantha Beech Amir Vera", "Shimon Prokupecz", "Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Samantha Beech", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/16/house-panel-secret-service-attempted-trump-shooting/75245839007/", "title": "House panel seeks Secret Service briefing on attempted Trump ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Members of a bipartisan House panel already had one assassination attempt against Donald Trump to investigate. Now, lawmakers are ramping up their inquiry after the Secret Service intercepted a gunman at a Trump golf course in Florida on Sunday.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., chair and ranking member of the task force created to investigate the July near-miss attempt on Trump's life, said in a joint statement they have requested a briefing with the Secret Service \"about what happened and how security responded.\"\n\n\"We are thankful that the former President was not harmed, but remain deeply concerned about political violence and condemn it in all of its forms,\" they said. \"The Task Force will share updates as we learn more.\"\n\nMultiple members of the task force said it was unclear Monday when the full committee Secret Service briefing will happen, but that they hope it can come together this week.\n\nTrump was golfing at his club in West Palm Beach on Sunday when agents opened fire on a man with a gun in the bushes near the edge of the course. The man dropped a rifle, two backpacks, a GoPro camera and other items and fled before being taken into custody.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:Secret Service's elevated presence thwarted potential second Trump assassination attempt\n\nLocal officials said the suspect is Ryan Routh, 58, who records show is from Hawaii and was a longtime voter in North Carolina. He is a registered Democrat and an impassioned supporter of Ukraine's defense against Russia.\n\nTrump was the target of an assassination attempt in July, when gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, opened fire during a rally in western Pennsylvania. Trump was grazed in the ear, producing iconic images of the bloodied former president, and one bystander was killed. Crooks was killed by a Secret Service sniper.\n\nThat shooting prompted intense scrutiny of Trump's security detail, leading to the creation of the Congressional task force and a House Oversight Committee hearing in which former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle admitted it was the biggest security failure in decades for the protective agency. Cheatle resigned shortly afterwards.\n\nRonald Rowe Jr., who took over as acting Secret Service Director, also told a joint Senate Judiciary and Homeland Security committee hearing that local law enforcement failed to communicate about the shooter's presence.\n\nMore:How did the new Donald Trump assassination attempt happen? Questions swirl\n\nThe House's bipartisan task force investigating that shooting is under a tight deadline: They have a mid-December deadline to issue their findings of what went wrong and make any recommendations for legislation that could prevent another assassination attempt. Kelly and Crow's joint statement indicates they are interested in including Sunday's shooting attempt in their ongoing probe, though Congress would likely need to approve the expanded inquiry.\n\n“Our (investigation) scope was actually set in a measure that we voted on, but my understanding is that there’s precedent to basically amend that,” said Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who said that it is likely that the inquiry will expand to include the incident at Trump's golf course Sunday. \"There’s a lot of overlap anyway.”\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told Fox News on Monday that \"Congress will act swiftly\" on lawmakers' recommendations. \"We need accountability. We must demand that this job is being done,\" he said.\n\nJohnson added that the task force will hold hearings \"not this week but next\" and added that there is an interim report due by the end of next week.\n\nMore:Trump assassination attempt in Florida: Who is suspect Ryan Routh?\n\nWhat lawmakers want to know\n\nFour task force members who spoke with USA TODAY agreed there is a clear question that needs answering: How did another potential shooter come this close to Trump?\n\n\"I obviously want to understand what went wrong, how we can make sure it doesn't happen again, and also how we can make sure that we create a sense of trust and faith on behalf of the American people and all of the institutions that are involved in this,\" said Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa.\n\nSome raised concerns that Trump is receiving less Secret Service protection than a sitting president. Waltz said the level of protection should be “threat based” and not tied to whether he currently is in office.\n\nMembers of the task force met Friday with Rowe, who told them that Trump's detail had been elevated to the level of a sitting president, Waltz said. But the Palm Beach sheriff said if that was the case, the entire golf course would have been surrounded by law enforcement.\n\n“So that’s a disconnect,” Waltz said. “We have flagged that for Secret Service leadership.”\n\nRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., told USA TODAY that President Joe Biden had requested additional security for Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. \"But it might be that still more needs to be done,\" he said. \"There's a lot of anger out there in the streets and there's 400 million guns. It's not a great combination at the moment.\"\n\nIvey said another question he has is how the suspect got his hands on an AK-47, given he has previously plead guilty to a felony involving a gun. And \"how did this guy know to be out there on the golf course?\" Ivey added. \"Is that just a coincidence? Did he follow a motorcade? That's something we need to know, I think, to make sure that there's nothing nefarious going on there.\"\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said that he has also been soliciting information from whistleblowers about the attempted assassination of Trump in July. He released a report with his findings on Monday and said he shared them with the House panel to help with their investigation.\n\n\"I'm stunned, I'm shocked, I'm sickened about what might have happened yesterday,\" said Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa. \"We must get at the truth. We must make sure that candidates and elected and the company they keep, the people who just want to be around them and learn what they stand for, are protected and kept safe.\"\n\nOther Congressional leaders also said Sunday that they were briefed on the incident. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that he spoke to Rowe on Sunday.\n\n\"I applaud the Secret Service for their quick response to ensure former President Trump’s safety,\" he said. “There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”\n\nJohnson said on X that he and his wife spent a few hours with Trump at Mar-a-Lago following the apparent assassination attempt. \"No leader in American history has endured more attacks and remained so strong and resilient,\" he said. \"He is unstoppable.\"\n\nJohnson told Fox News that Trump was in \"really good spirits\" when they met. \"God has spared his life twice now.\"\n\nZac Anderson contributed.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html", "title": "Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Manhattan jury has found two Trump Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives.\n\nThe Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced.\n\nDonald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former president was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n\nThe Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/politics/man-arrested-near-brett-kavanaugh-home/index.html", "title": "Brett Kavanaugh: Armed man arrested near justice's home charged ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Justice Department has charged the man who was arrested near Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s house in Maryland early Wednesday with attempting or threatening to kidnap or murder a US judge.\n\nThe man, Nicholas John Roske, 26, of Simi Valley, California, had called emergency authorities saying he was having suicidal thoughts and had a firearm in his suitcase, leading to his arrest, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nHe told law enforcement he had traveled from California to kill “a specific United States Supreme Court Justice,” according to an FBI affidavit filed Wednesday. The affidavit said Roske was upset about the leak of the Supreme Court opinion related to abortion rights, an upcoming gun control case and the school shooting last month in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n“Roske indicated that he believed the Justice that he intended to kill would side with Second Amendment decisions that would loosen gun control laws,” the FBI agent wrote. “Roske stated that he began thinking about how to give his life a purpose and decided that he would kill the Supreme Court Justice” after breaking into his home. Roske planned to kill himself as well, the affidavit added.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Roske was carrying a suitcase and backpack filled with a tactical knife, a Glock 17 pistol, two magazines, ammunition, pepper spray and zip ties, the FBI said.\n\nRoske also had on hand a hammer, screwdriver, nail punch, crowbar, pistol light and duct tape, the affidavit said.\n\nRoske appeared in a Greenbelt, Maryland, federal court Wednesday and agreed to remain in jail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 22.\n\nWearing a dark gray long-sleeve shirt and black pants, Roske was asked by District Judge Tim Sullivan if he understood the nature of the charges that were brought against him, Roske said he wasn’t “thinking clearly” but understood what was going on.

He did not specify what medication.\n\nWhite House ‘condemns’ in ‘strongest terms’\n\nThe White House says President Joe Biden condemns the actions of the armed individual arrested outside Kavanaugh’s home. White House spokesman Andrew Bates told CNN “President Biden condemns the actions of this individual in the strongest terms, and is grateful to law enforcement for quickly taking him into custody.”\n\n“As the President has consistently made clear, public officials – including judges – must be able to do their jobs without concern for their personal safety or that of their families. And any violence, threats of violence, or attempts to intimidate justices have no place in our society. He has said that himself, and his spokespeople have been forceful about this from the podium.”\n\nBates noted that Biden “supports legislation to fund increased security for the court and judges.”\n\nIncrease in threats\n\nThere has been a rise in threats against the court amid the national abortion rights debate and protests that have taken place across the US. The Department of Homeland Security issued a memo last month warning law enforcement that there are potential threats to members of the Supreme Court after a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\nThe memo also said Supreme Court police have noticed a major uptick in social media threats of violence, with some currently under investigation. Some of those threats have been directed at the justices and the court building, which is now surrounded by fencing.\n\nThe arrest happened hours before the justices were scheduled to issue more rulings in the final weeks of the annual session.\n\nThe court did not respond to a question if Kavanaugh was at the building Wednesday morning. The building has been closed to the public since March 2020, and justices no longer announce their opinions from the courtroom bench due to covid protocols.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Abortion rights supporters chant outside Supreme Court Justices' homes 01:32 - Source: CNN\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Wednesday that “threats of violence and actual violence against” Supreme Court justices “strike at the heart of our democracy and we will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable.”\n\n“This kind of behavior is obviously behavior that we will not tolerate,” Garland told reporters. “Threats of violence and actual violence against the justices of course strike at the heart of our democracy and we will do everything we can to prevent them and to hold people who do them accountable.”\n\nMaryland Gov.

The total eclipse of the sun then traced a path from southern Texas to northern Maine, where it exited into Canada and the ocean beyond.\n\nThe rare event was an astronomical experience like no other. Monday's eclipse was unusually accessible to millions of people. It was widely anticipated not only for its remarkable period of darkness, but for its rare timing: No total solar eclipse would be visible from the contiguous United States again until 2044. While millions of Americans may have seen today’s eclipse, a small group in Texas was among the very first.\n\nEdge of eclipse shadow began in south Texas\n\nAlejandra Martinez, a seventh-grade science teacher from the south Texas border city of Eagle Pass, peered up at the gray, gauzy sky, anxiously awaiting the solar eclipse’s entrance into the USA.\n\nSitting with a telescope under a camping canopy in a corner of the county airport, Martinez, 42, and two other science enthusiasts had been recruited by NASA to participate in an effort called Citizen CATE 2024, where more than 30 teams perched in the eclipse’s path will record the shadowy trek across the country.\n\nIn this spot, less than five miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, she and her team would be among the first people in the U.S. to witness the phenomenon. Eagle Pass sits near the very beginning of the eclipse’s track from southwest to northeast across the country. It also sits very near dead-center of it, where the period of “totality” will be the longest. That total shadow was still more than an hour away when the edge of the shadow began to darken the sky.\n\nMartinez, dressed in a “This Totality Rocks” T-shirt and eclipse-themed skirt, watched as the penumbra crept across the airfield, about 10 minutes past noon local time. She put on her eclipse glasses and peered up at the sky. The gauzy clouds parted. “There it is! There it is!” she yelled. “First contact. It’s begun!”\n\nClouds came and went as the shadow grew for the next hour. As totality approached Eagle Pass, the sky shaded a dull gray then a heavy brown and the temperature dropped a few degrees. Only a sliver of the sun remained.\n\nA few seconds before 1:27 p.m. CT, the crowd counted down, “3..2..1…” The sun was gone, completely covered by the moon. Darkness spread over the small airport grounds. “Oh my god,” Martinez said, a hand covering her heart. “This is so cool!”\n\nHow to tell if you have eye damage from looking at a partial eclipse?\n\nFor those who took a chance and looked at the sun without protective eyewear during the eclipse, concerns may arise if their vision starts to seem impaired. Have they suffered eclipse blindness?\n\nLooking directly at the sun even briefly without the proper safety glasses can result in eye damage, either temporary or permanent. The body's natural squinting reaction in normal circumstances prevents people from staring directly at the sun, but that reflex may not be activated during partial eclipses, even though a partly shielded sun can still burn the retina.\n\nThe American Academy of Ophthalmology says pain won't be an indication of damaged eyes because the retina lacks pain nerves. Worrisome signs are instead blurry vision, headaches, light sensitivity, blind spots in the central vision, distorted vision and changes in color perception. Anyone experiencing those symptoms should see an ophthalmologist, the AAO says.\n\nWhat was the timeline of the 2024 solar eclipse?\n\nThe total eclipse began in Mexico at about 11:07 a.m. PDT, Monday before crossing into Texas at 1:27 p.m. CDT. It ended in Maine at 3:35 p.m. EDT. Even those who weren't in the path of totality could see a percentage of the eclipse.\n\nTo find out exactly when the eclipse occurred in your area, you can search by USA TODAY's database by ZIP code for a viewing guide.\n\nStudents in Washington get hands-on learning\n\nDozens of students spilled out of Ida B. Wells Middle School in Washington, D.C., gripping cardboard solar eclipse glasses and chatting with excitement. “Why is the sun shaped as a moon?” one student asked after looking toward the sun. “Why is it not getting dark?’’ asked another.\n\nTeacher Troy Mangum, who the students called “Mr. Mango,’’ slowly explained the science behind the experience as he cautioned others to put on their glasses. Students at the school in northwest D.C. had had lessons about the eclipse leading up the day’s teaching outside the classroom.\n\n“Anytime we can get hands on or dynamic learning … it’s invaluable,’’ said Mangum, a social emotional learning coach. “We talked about it so much. It’s nice to see them get excited about qeeky Mr. Mango type of stuff.”\n\nSkylar Cruel, 12, had come outside with her science class. “I just really wanted to see it,’’ she said. “You get to see it turn from light to dark.”\n\nSteps away at Whittier Elementary School, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), younger students put on their glasses and tilted their heads up toward the sun behind their school.\n\nMichael Haile joined his daughter, Markan Worku, 9, a student at Whittier, and brought along his 5-year-old son, Keab. He called it a memorable experience for his children. Markan, who had been learning about solar eclipses in her third-grade class, simply said, “This is cool!’’\n\n− Deborah Berry\n\nIn Michigan, a bonding experience for a mother and her three kids\n\nIn Michigan, eclipse enthusiasts packed a watch party along the Detroit Riverwalk near Cullen Plaza. They sat on the grass, on benches and berms. For Janelle Ikonen of Waterford, it was a chance to bond with her three children − Hannah, 9; Elim, 12; and Isaac, 14 − whom she took out of school for the day.\n\n“I wanted to experience a unique event with them,” said Ikonen, 47. “It’s one of my big deals to me, to experience things with my kids. … I hope they’ll remember spending time with me.”\n\nIn Grand Rapids, where 94% coverage of the sun was expected, viewers gathered on the city's “Blue Bridge,” which offered a view of the eclipse over the Grand River. With no cloud cover over the city, visitors had an unobstructed scene. The Grand Rapids Public Museum set up a series of solar telescopes.\n\nJill and Wes Johnson, 50 and 14, were among those awaiting max coverage. They’d considered traveling from Grand Rapids to a place with total coverage, but decided 94% coverage was worthwhile enough to stay home.\n\n“I think people are excited to see something unique,” Jill Johnson said.\n\n− Georgea Kovanis and Arpan Lobo, Detroit Free Press\n\nUS women's soccer team takes in eclipse ahead of title game\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio − The U.S. women’s national soccer team took a break from SheBelieves Cup preparation to watch the eclipse.\n\nSeveral team members, including World Cup veterans Crystal Dunn, Alyssa Naeher, Naomi Girma and Trinity Rodman, coaches and staff members donned eclipse glasses and went outside their hotel to see the rare event.\n\nAs the sky darkened and the moon moved in front of the sun, someone yelled, “Come on, keep going!” Columbus is just outside the path of totality, so all but a sliver of the sun wound up being covered.\n\nThe USWNT is in Columbus for the final of the SheBelieves Cup on Tuesday night against Canada.\n\n− Nancy Armour\n\nWitnessing the first total eclipse from a cruise ship\n\nPassengers aboard Holland America's Koningsdam cruise ship eagerly gathered on the top decks at 10 a.m. local time to watch the spectacle of a solar eclipse.\n\nPositioned off the coast of Mazatlan, Mexico − the first city in North America to witness the total eclipse − the ship provided an ideal vantage point for viewing the celestial event. Accompanied by an astronomer, the captain meticulously adjusted the ship's position to ensure the best possible view.\n\nDan Fueller, an experienced eclipse observer who had previously seen similar phenomena from ships in 1991 and 1998, emphasized the advantages of viewing the eclipse from a cruise ship. He noted the flexibility of the ship's mobility allowed for optimal positioning along the eclipse's path, ensuring unobstructed views.\n\n\"You're on a cruise ship and (the best view) is a little bit farther to the west or a little bit farther to the east − along the path, there's a clear sky − the ship can move. If you're on land and there's not a road there, you better have a tank.\"\n\n− Joshuan Rivera\n\nPartial eclipse 'like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun'\n\nIn Parthenon, Arkansas, the eclipse began near the Buffalo National River. Five friends traveled from Florida to be on a rock outcropping to witness the celestial event.\n\n“Yes! I see it!” Angie Printiss exclaimed.\n\n“Oh ya! You can see it,” said Kate Estes. “It’s like a little Pac-Man taking a bite out of the sun.”\n\nAt 20 minutes before totality, the sky got noticeably darker. The shadow of crescent sun shapes played off the limestone rocks.\n\n“It looks like water − like fish scales,” Estes said. “That is so weird, when the trees move you can really see it.”\n\n− Jennifer Portman\n\nNew Englanders travel for better view of the eclipse\n\nCrowds ballooned into the thousands midday Monday in the center of St. Johnsbury, Vermont, as the nearly cloudless sky and warm sun boosted temperatures to an unseasonably 60 degrees.\n\nJim and Kim Cooper drove over from New Hampton, New Hampshire, their first time doing more than just passing through the town locals call St. Jays. Their son had proposed to his girlfriend in Tennessee during the 2017 eclipse and then had an eclipse-themed wedding, but the Coopers had never seen a total eclipse for themselves, so they decided to come to the closest place where they could be assured of a good view.\n\nJeffrey Breau had seen that 2017 eclipse for himself and was so impressed that he convinced family members to join him this time. Breau’s girlfriend, Nell Hawley, came up with him from Cambridge, Massachusetts, while his brother Alex and his girlfriend Diana Ventura drove up from New York City. The Breau brothers' father, Walter, joined them in taking in their first eclipse.\n\n“I would have been OK watching it in the yard,” Walter said, though he would only have seen a partial eclipse from there. “That’s what you think now,” Jeffrey said quickly. “Talk to me in two hours.”\n\n− Karen Weintraub\n\nKids bring homemade eclipse viewers to National Mall\n\nLucas and Lucy Porto Banco didn’t need to buy fancy eclipse glasses – the 7- and 10-year-old siblings made their own eclipse viewers from two cardboard shoe boxes left over from a couple of their mom’s recent shoe purchases.With the help of a YouTube tutorial video, they made two holes in each box with a whittling knife and taped tin foil over. Then they used dry spaghetti to poke holes in the tin foil for the sun’s light to pass through and project onto the dark inside of the box.The kids put together the viewer in little more than five minutes, Lucy said. “Maybe 15, with covering all the gaps in the shoe box,” she said.Even with his own eclipse-viewing creation, Lucas said he may still take advantage of his eclipse glasses. “I’m going to do both,” he said.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nWhat is an 'umbra?' − and other eclipse words\n\nAstronomers and eclipse enthusiasts used a bunch of specialized words Monday as the nation experienced its first solar eclipse since 2017 and the last one for until 2044. Here are a few of those terms and what they mean, according to the American Astronomical Society.\n\nBaily's Beads – This refers to the beaded appearance of the moon's edge as the eclipse nears totality. Shafts of sunlight shine through deep valleys on the moon's surface, which causes the effect known to observers as Bailey's Beads.\n\nUmbra – The darkest part of the moon’s shadow, within which the entirety of the sun's bright face is blocked. An observer standing in the umbra sees a total solar eclipse.\n\nPenumbra: The lighter part of the moon's shadow, making up its outer portion, where light can reach.\n\nCorona – The sun’s upper atmosphere, visible as a pearly glow around the eclipsed sun during totality.\n\nTotality – The maximum phase of a total solar eclipse, during which the moon’s disk completely covers the sun's bright face. It can last from a fraction of a second to a maximum of 7 minutes, 31 seconds, depending on viewing location and other factors.\n\n− Dale Denwalt, The Oklahoman\n\nA last-minute search for glasses for 'a perfect spot'\n\nPatsy Faoro walked toward a half dozen people gathered at the gate of Turner Farm Park in Great Falls, Virginia. The people were awaiting the opening of an eclipse viewing event complete with telescopes and educational presentations.\n\nFaoro, who lives near the park in this upscale Northern Virginia neighborhood, just wanted glasses to safely view the eclipse.\n\nShe visited CVS, Safeway and a 7/11 convenience store, all of which had advertised the availability of glasses to view the eclipse. None of the retailers had any glasses remaining when Faoro checked this morning.\n\n“We have this great big open space that’s a perfect spot,” said Faoro, who viewed her first eclipse in the 1970s. “We just need some glasses.”\n\n− Ken Alltucker\n\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway event draws tens of thousands\n\nTory Patrick, 41, is hoping to give her four children a once-in-a-lifetime learning opportunity. Patrick and her family traveled 160 miles to Indianapolis Motor Speedway from their home in Granger, Indiana. They were expected to have 97% totality at home, but it’s not the same as total coverage, she said.\n\n“They will be getting the full experience that they can’t read about in textbooks,” Patrick said.\n\nPatrick and her sister Cally Gannon, 39, from Cincinnati, met in Indianapolis to view the eclipse from the speedway. They camped outside IMS over the weekend ahead of the event and on Sunday afternoon saw a double rainbow over the speedway’s iconic pagoda. An estimated 50,000 tickets were sold for the day’s festivities, presented in partnership with NASA and Purdue University.\n\nElsewhere in the stands, Ryan Harper, 30, knows today is special.\n\n“We’re right in totality,” he said. “This sometimes doesn’t happen in people’s lifetimes.\n\n— Sarah Bowman and Jade Thomas\n\nFamily travels from Baltimore to Rochester, N.Y., to view the eclipse\n\nWhen Maze Pelham of Baltimore was a fifth-grader, he watched news of the 2017 solar eclipse and vowed to witness the next notable solar eclipse. That eclipse, and that day, has come. And this is why he and his parents, Janice and Sonney Pelham, left Maryland around 1 a.m. on Monday and drove nearly seven hours to Rochester, New York.\n\n“I said to myself I would go to the next one,” Maze Pelham said while seated with his parents on lawn chairs at downtown Rochester’s Parcel 5 park, where he and hundreds of others are awaiting a view of the full eclipse. “It’s a promise I made to myself.”\n\n– Democrat and Chronicle, part of the USA TODAY Network\n\nIn Brooklyn: Eclipses glasses, check. Lawn chair, check.\n\nRalph Emerson held a pair of paper sunglasses in his hands while riding the subway to Brooklyn's sprawling Prospect Park on Monday. He exited the train with a folded lawn chair strapped across his shoulder, and said he felt energized and full of anticipation.\n\n\"This is special,\" Emerson, 61, said. \"I haven't woken up with this much excitement since the Super Bowl.\"\n\nWalking to the park's botanic garden, Emerson said appreciating natural phenomena makes it easier to manage the stresses that come with living in a big city. Also like a big sports game, the eclipse will draw lots of people together to experience something much larger than themselves, in community, he said.\n\n\"A lot of times it's tragedies that bring us together, but sometimes things like this do,\" he said.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nTexas Eclipse Festival cut short by weather\n\nThe Texas Eclipse Festival was canceled Monday in Burnet County, 50 miles northwest of Austin, because of weather concerns. The festival, which included bands and other events, began Sunday and was supposed to wrap up Tuesday.\n\n\"We regret to inform you of the severe weather forecast, including risks of high winds, tornadic activity, large hail, and thunderstorms for later today, including during the eclipse, Tuesday, and Wednesday,\" festival organizers said on their website. \"Your safety is our top priority.\"\n\nFestivalgoers were urged to leave early for safety and to beat traffic. Guests, however, were allowed to stay \"provided they pack and are prepared to depart after totality.\"\n\nTraffic jams, collisions mar eclipse watchers' travel\n\nTraffic crashes and road delays were reported across the nation as Americans flocked to prime locations to gaze up at the rare solar eclipse. Local roads and highways in states including Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Vermont and New Hampshire were overwhelmed with eclipse chasers, many of whom were from out of state. The most intense bottlenecks appeared to be in the path of totality, where spectators will be able to view the full eclipse.\n\nIn Oklahoma, a crash around 7:30 a.m. local time narrowed eastbound lanes on I-40, a major transcontinental highway that runs from California to North Carolina. The crash occurred not far from several state parks that were hosting eclipse events, and it's also within driving distance of the full eclipse path, which includes parts of southeastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.\n\nMultiple crashes were reported on an interstate in Waco, Texas, a city in the path of totality, where several festivities and eclipse viewing events were scheduled. The crashes all occurred on I-35, which runs from southern Texas to Minnesota.\n\n\"Expect major traffic delays in this area,\" the Texas Department of Transportation said in a statement.\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nAirport draws a crowd of jets for eclipse\n\nEAGLE PASS, Texas − Maverick County International Airport in Eagle Pass, Texas, usually sees maybe three private planes a day. By 10 a.m. CT on Monday, more than 10 planes crowded the tarmac, including Cessnas, Pipers and at least one corporate jet − all there to catch an early glimpse of the total solar eclipse. Eagle Pass will be one of the first American cities to witness the phenomenon. Some watchers, like Brandon Beck, 43, flew in Sunday night from San Diego and spent the night in a sleeping bag on the tarmac next to his friend’s Mooney single-prop piston four-seater.“We’re so lucky to be on a planet where the sun is the perfect size and perfect distance to create that effect,” he said. “It’s obligatory. We have to see it.”\n\nFirst the Cherry Blossoms, then the eclipse\n\nWASHINGTON − The Cherry Blossoms brought Ali and Aurore Youssouf to the city all the way from Paris, but the pair were delighted to learn that their trip would overlap with the eclipse. The day is extra special for Aurore Youssouf, 43, who has never seen an eclipse before. On Monday morning, the couple arrived by chance at the National Mall early enough to snag a few pairs of free eclipse glasses distributed by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum for the occasion.“We didn’t even know. We just ended up here and found out that they were giving away some glasses,” said Ali Youssouf, 46.\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nAwaiting eclipse − and hail − in Texas\n\nKERRVILLE, Texas − Forecasts called for considerable cloudiness, rain and possible hail, but retired NASA engineer Jeff Stone stayed positive as he and his wife prepared to host more than a dozen people for a watch party at their hilltop home in Texas Hill Country. Stone, an eclipse enthusiast who had met family in Missouri to watch the solar eclipse of 2017, said he recently reviewed video footage of that event and said current conditions weren’t that much different than they were back then.\n\n“I’m outside and seeing patches of blue among scattered clouds, so we’re remaining hopeful,” he said.\n\nAbout 150 miles to the northeast in Gatesville, lead pastor Eric Moffett of Coryell Community Church said a similar forecast did little to deter an expected gathering of about 800 visitors for the church’s family-oriented “Eclipse at the Crosses” event. Many, if not most, were from out of town or even out of country − Canada, Wales, France, Italy. Many locals were staying home to avoid the crowd, he said.\n\n“It’s partly cloudy, but the sun is shining on me right now,” he said. “We are praying that it stays that way.”\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nWhat is the difference between a solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse?\n\nA total solar eclipse occurs when the moon comes in between the Earth and the sun, blocking its light from reaching our planet, leading to a period of darkness lasting several minutes. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon and the sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. The Earth blocks the sunlight that normally reaches the moon. Instead of that sunlight hitting the moon’s surface, Earth's shadow falls on it.\n\nA lunar eclipse can last for a few hours, while a solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes. Solar eclipses also rarely occur, while lunar eclipses are comparatively more frequent. While at least two partial lunar eclipses happen every year, total lunar eclipses are still rare, NASA says. Another major difference: No special glasses or gizmos are needed to view the a lunar eclipse, and people can directly stare at the moon.\n\n− Saman Shafiq\n\nSolar eclipse, lunar eclipse:What is the difference?\n\nCan you drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nThe 2024 solar eclipse will shroud much of the United States in darkness on Monday, leaving many people to wonder: Is it safe to drive during the solar eclipse?\n\nIt is safe to drive during an eclipse as long as you don't look up at the sky. AAA is telling drivers to be focused on the road if they are operating a car during the total solar eclipse. But the automobile insurance company is advising Americans who want to safely view the total eclipse to \"find a safe place to park (not on the side of a road or highway) away from other traffic and then wear your eclipse glasses,\" said Aixa Diaz, a spokeswoman from AAA.\n\n\"Pack your patience, whether traveling a great distance or locally,\" Diaz said. \"People will be out and about to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.\"\n\nA similar scenario played out in 2017 during the nation's last total solar eclipse: Congestion in some areas lasted for up to 13 hours after totality, according to Transportation Research News, a National Research Council publication. An analysis of traffic patterns from that year suggests the worst of the traffic – on interstates and rural back roads alike – will kick off after the eclipse ends and everyone tries to leave all at once.\n\n− Kayla Jimenez\n\nWhen will the next solar eclipse happen?\n\nIt will be 20 years before there's a chance to witness a total solar eclipse in the United States again. According to NASA, after Monday's total solar eclipse, the next one viewable from the contiguous U.S. will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\n\nUnfortunately, the 2044 total solar eclipse won't have the broad reach across the U.S. as the 2024 eclipse. The path of totality during the 2044 eclipse will only touch three states, according to the Planetary Society, a nonprofit involved in research, public outreach and political space advocacy. The eclipse will begin in Greenland, sweep through Canada and end around sunset in Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nBut another eclipse scheduledfor Saturday, Aug. 12, 2045, will trace a path of totality over California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Florida and Georgia.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdridge, Gabe Hauari and Eric Lagatta\n\nEclipse and pets: It's not the sky that's the problem\n\nAn eclipse itself isn't dangerous for domestic animals such as dogs and cats, but experts say it's probably best to not bring pets to experience the April 2024 total solar eclipse. Experts' biggest concern is not what’s happening in the sky but on the ground as crowds of excited and eager people gather, said Dr. Rena Carlson, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dogs especially will take their cues from their owners rather than the celestial event.\n\n“Rather than the effects of the eclipse, I would be more worried about the excitement and all of the people,” Carlson said.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nA guide to the solar eclipse for kids\n\nHere's an easy-to read, illustrated guide to help kids understand what the April 8 total solar eclipse means, where it will be visible and how you can watch it safely. It also shows them how an ordinary kitchen colander can easily be used to view a solar eclipse − the colander's holes can project crescent images of the sun onto the ground. There are even pages that can be downloaded and colored.\n\nTrump's eclipse experience lit up internet in 2017\n\nSeven years ago, when the last total solar eclipse crossed over North America, a photo of then-President Donald Trump seemingly gazing at the sun with his naked eyes set the internet ablaze. During the afternoon of Aug. 21, 2017, Trump, who was president at the time, was joined by then first lady Melania Trump and their son Barron to watch the rare phenomenon from the Truman Balcony at the White House. Photos taken by members of the media captured all three donning eclipse glasses while looking at the eclipse.\n\nBut at one point during the viewing, the former president was captured in photos and videos without proper eye protection, seemingly gazing directly at the sun. Looking at an eclipse before or after the brief phase of totality without proper eyewear can lead to eye damage.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the next total solar eclipse?What to know about the next eclipse's path, timing\n\nHow to make a solar eclipse viewer\n\nPeople who didn't manage to get their hands on glasses are not completely down and out. There are other safe ways to view the eclipse, say experts, and a lot of them only require a little bit of craftiness and items you can find lying around the house.\n\nSteps to make the cereal box eclipse viewer (And here is a video aid):\n\nGet an empty, clean cereal box.\n\nCut a white piece of cardboard that will fit snuggly in the bottom of the box, or secure it permanently by gluing it in place.\n\nCut the top of the cereal box, removing both ends and leaving the center intact.\n\nPut a piece of tape across the center of the top to securely hold it closed.\n\nTape a piece of heavy-duty foil or double a single layer for additional strength, covering one of the openings at the top of the cereal box. The other opening will remain open for viewing.\n\nUsing a small nail (approximately 3mm in diameter) push a hole in the foil.\n\nCover the entire box with construction paper, leaving the single-viewing opening and the foil uncovered.\n\nThe finished box should be held with the pin-hole side facing the sun. It may take a little practice pointing the box. With your back facing the sun, look through the viewing opening. A small image of the sun, about ½ cm in diameter, can be seen projected on the white paper inside the box.\n\n− Mary Walrath-Holdrid\n\nWhat is the path of the solar eclipse called?\n\nThose in the direct line of the eclipse will be treated to an incredible sight as the moon completely blots out the sun's disk, ushering in uncharacteristic darkness and revealing the sun's elusive outermost layer called the corona. That moment is called \"totality\" and this year the path of totality crosses through 13 U.S. states.\n\nThe last total solar eclipse to cut through North America was in August 2017.\n\nHow to look at eclipse without glasses\n\nA total solar eclipse offers skygazers the rare opportunity to witness the eclipse with the naked eye. However, solar eclipse glasses are still needed until totality is reached.\n\nCertified solar eclipse glasses are crucial for spectators to avoid the sun's retina-damaging rays. But when the moon moves completely in front of the sun and blocks its light, you'll know it's safe to remove the glasses for a short period of time.\n\nHow fast does an eclipse shadow travel?\n\nAccording to a post from the National Weather Service in Indianapolis on X, an eclipse shadow travels at speeds from 1,100 to 5,000 mph. Near the equator, it travels at around 1,100 mph and increases in speed as it approaches the poles.\n\nThe eclipse party is over? Time to recycle those glasses!\n\nAstronomers Without Borders, or AWB, a non-profit organization running its second nationwide eclipse glasses recycling drive. Her business will join over 300 schools, museums, city governments, commercial businesses, community organizations and local libraries that will collect and ship an estimated millions of glasses to be repurposed for use by underserved communities around the world in future solar eclipses.\n\nAWB launched its first run of the program after the last solar eclipse in 2017 when volunteer centers across the country collected millions of the glass. After vetting them for reuse, more than half a million glasses were distributed to Africa, Asia and South America.\n\nPeople can visit AWB's website to find their nearest participating collection center and learn more about recycling the glasses, said Andrew Fazekas, the organization's communication manager.\n\n\"We figure there's probably going to be tens of millions of glasses out there at the very least,\" he said. \"And most of them are probably very gently used.\"\n\n− Cybele Mayes-Osterman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/27/government-shutdown-2023-odds-probability-live-updates/70978602007/", "title": "Possible government shutdown 2023: How a shutdown affects you", "text": "Editor's note: This page is the news of a potential government shutdown from Wednesday, Sept. 27.

Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.\n\nThe impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.\n\nHere are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:\n\nFunding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately\n\nFood stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that\n\nChildren from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs\n\nCollege students could see delays in their student loans\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work\n\nTravelers could see delays with receiving passports\n\nNational parks could close\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nU.S. Postal Service not affected by a possible government shutdown\n\nThe Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.\n\n\"Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,\" the statement said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nBiden says government shutdown not ‘inevitable,’ urges House Republicans ‘do their job’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Americans need House Republicans to “do their job” as he held out hope Wednesday that a government shutdown can be avoided before the end-of-week deadline for congressional action.\n\n“I don’t think anything is inevitable in politics,” Biden said, speaking in San Francisco at the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which recommends federal policy on science and technology.\n\nBiden said a government shutdown would impact “vital work in science and health” including cancer research and food-safety policies.\n\n“The American people need our Republican friends in the House of Representatives to do their job: Fund the government,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWill military get paid in October?\n\nMilitary pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.\n\n“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.\n\nBut the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.\n\n“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.\n\nThe government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nWill a government shutdown affect flights?\n\nThe deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.\n\nFunding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.\n\nImpacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.\n\nConsular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”\n\nThere could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.\n\n− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller\n\nWould a government shutdown affect Social Security?\n\nSocial Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.\n\nHowever, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.\n\nA few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill a government shutdown affect food stamps and WIC?\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, will continue for at least the month of October, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a press briefing Monday. But he warned that “if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP.”\n\nFunding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − better known as WIC − will stop “immediately when the shutdown occurs,” he said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has a contingency fund that may extend the program for a day or two, and some states may have leftover WIC benefits not spent that could extend the program for a week or so in that state.\n\n“But the vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” Vilsack said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat happens to the IRS in a shutdown?\n\nThe IRS may have to partially close starting this weekend if there is a government shutdown.\n\nWhile the agency initially said it would be able to continue operations and pay employees through a shutdown, the IRS reversed course last week, telling the National Treasury Employees their new contingency plan would include some furloughs.\n\nMillions of Americans are still waiting for their tax refunds from the last filing season, and there is concern a shutdown and IRS closure would escalate this backlog.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat is the deadline for the government shutdown?\n\nThe U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.\n\nThe continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the House will vote Friday on a continuing resolution, but it's unclear if it has enough votes to pass.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDoes a government shutdown affect state employees?\n\nA shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.\n\nIn this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.\n\nBut state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does a government shutdown affect the stock market?\n\nWhile a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.\n\nIt's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”\n\nWhile the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.\n\nSeptember is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.\n\nMeanwhile, there are a \"lot of other items going on\" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices\n\n“We're in a very volatile time now,\" Silverblatt said.\n\nThere have been six partial or full government shutdowns since 1990. While some were resolved in less than a week, the most recent in late 2018 and early 2019 lasted over one month.\n\nWhen looking at the S&P 500’s median performance one month after the shutdown compared with one month prior, the benchmark gained a median of 5.5% with positive returns five out of six times, according to a Wednesday note from Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey.\n\n“Like the people that occupy the chambers of Congress, past shutdowns have been a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,” the note reads.\n\nIn other words, the looming shutdown is \"more of a headline event than a bottom-line event,\" according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Past shutdowns, he said, left \"angered tourists more than disappointed traders.\"\n\nA Sept. 13 Wells Fargo report led by global strategist Gery Schollberg and analyst Jennifer Timmerman notes that while the S&P 500 tends to sag before and through the early part of longer shutdowns, “it did not take long for stocks to regain composure after the government reopened in each instance.”\n\n“This time, however, a shutdown risks aggravating other potential body blows to the economy … leaving stocks more exposed to volatility and to extended weakness.”\n\nThe report's authors said they believe a shutdown, if it does occur, has the potential to last at least a few weeks because of hardened positions in an increasingly polarized Congress.\n\n\"The longer it goes, the more difficult it will become economically and also from an asset market perspective,\" Zabicki of LPL said, adding that Washington's polarization \"increases the risk that something could go wrong.\"\n\nHowever, he said recent history shows that \"these are typically not long-lasting events.”\n\n− Bailey Schulz and Daniel de Vise\n\nWhat is a government shutdown?\n\nA government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.\n\nSome of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.\n\nBut so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is the meaning of furloughed?\n\nA furlough occurs when an employee is required to take a mandatory and temporary unpaid leave of absence from their work. An employer can furlough employees to cut back costs or manage operations during a potential government shutdown.\n\nA furlough is different from a layoff, which are permanent terminations in which employees can’t return back to work.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen would a government shutdown start?\n\nA government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.\n\nThe stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\n'Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will'\n\nA government shutdown, some Republicans say, is inevitable at this point given the time crunch Congress is facing and the gridlock between lawmakers.\n\nMcCarthy has committed to voting Friday on a stopgap bill to keep the government open, but even if House Republicans pass it along party lines, it’s a non-starter with the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nWhen asked if the two chambers could reconcile their differences ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline, Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator, told reporters, “We all know the answer to that: No, there’s not enough time.”\n\n“Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will and I think conventional wisdom should tell you that,” Womack added. He said he hopes lawmakers could have an “epiphany” and avert a shutdown in the waning days.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nSenate blames fractured House GOP caucus for looming government shutdown\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning that McCarthy is aiming for a government shutdown by adhering to ultraconservatives in his party.\n\nHe encouraged the House speaker to work in a bipartisan way to pass a stopgap measure in the lower chamber and said the California lawmaker has “twisted himself into pretzels” to “avoid his responsibility of governing.”\n\n“Every bill House Republicans have pushed has been partisan. Every C.R. has been aimed at the hard right and every path they’ve pursued to date will inevitably lead to a shutdown,” Schumer said.\n\nMcConnell echoed Schumer’s call for bipartisanship, saying on the Senate floor Wednesday that shutting down the government “isn’t an effective way to make a point.\" For Congress to move forward on unresolved funding priorities, they must avert a shutdown, he said.\n\n− Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's the probability of a government shutdown?\n\nHold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.\n\nBut both of those options are unlikely as of Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on all 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.\n\nLast week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat are the 12 appropriation bills?\n\nIn order to fund the government, lawmakers must pass 12 appropriations bills – each tailored to a specific government function.\n\nThe appropriations bills are handled by their respective subcommittees in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. For example, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense steers the Defense spending bill, which provides funding for the Department of Defense and other related activities.\n\nIn previous years, Congress passed an “omnibus” package – a massive bill combining all 12 appropriations bills into one piece of legislation. The change this year is among the concessions House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made to hardline conservatives in his bid for the job in January when he promised to pass all 12 bills separately.\n\nHard-right lawmakers have argued a vote on each bill would allow for more transparency in the spending process. But with three days left before a government shutdown, it is virtually impossible for Congress to pass all 12 bills in time considering the House has only passed one of the 12 and the Senate hasn't passed any.\n\nThe only likely resolution to avert a shutdown is a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open and buy lawmakers more time to move through the appropriations process.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nLatest updates on the government shutdown\n\nGOP lawmakers emerged from a closed-door weekly conference meeting Wednesday, deriding the Senate’s version of a temporary funding bill for its lack of border security provisions. It's the major sticking point for most House Republicans in the government shutdown fight who say any funding measure must include border security language.\n\n“The Senate is going to have to realize that the House is not going to move something that doesn't have border security at its core,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a key negotiator and chair of the centrist Republican Main Street Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning.\n\nBut House GOP requests for an aggressive border security package have almost no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. That's why Johnson and other Republicans are pinning the blame on Democrats for refusing to cede to their demands even though the House has been consumed by GOP infighting for the past weeks in spending negotiations.\n\n“If they’re not willing to accept that fact, they are standing in the way of us funding this government,” Johnson said.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nWhat would happen if the government shuts down?\n\nIn a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not \"essential\" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.\n\nThis means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.\n\nAir travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow long would the government shutdown last?\n\nGovernment funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown would last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.\n\nThe length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education \"have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”\n\n“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow long was the last government shutdown?\n\nThe last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.\n\nIt was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.\n\n−Olivia Munson\n\nGovernment shutdown history chart\n\nOver the last five decades, there have been 21 federal shutdowns:\n\n1976 : Under President Gerald Ford.

Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.\n\n“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.\n\nTheir staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMajority of Americans want Congress to prevent government shutdown: poll\n\nA Monmouth University poll released Wednesday found over 60% of Americans want Congress to compromise to avert a government shutdown.Americans polled reported they do not feel President Joe Biden or lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are looking out for Americans.According to the poll, 43% of Americans would hold Republicans most responsible for a shutdown.

The multiyear program will support training and apprenticeship for about 13,000 new workers.\n\n“Thirty million people in America get their health care through community health centers that treat people regardless of their ability to pay,” said Carole Johnson, administrator of the US Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration, which is facilitating the grants. “Time and time again, we have seen community health workers make the difference when it comes to reaching out in communities and getting people engaged in care and then helping people stay connected to care.”\n\nThese health workers are able to build trust to serve as messengers in their communities, she told CNN.\n\n“When you lead a very complicated life and you have to take three buses to get to a doctor’s appointment and you have to take time off work, it can be very, very hard to do what is routine for a lot of other people,” she said. “And so community health workers can be that essential bridge that can help make sure people stay connected to their health care provider,” whether it’s for chronic disease management, mental health and substance use disorders, or maternity care.\n\nThirty of the 83 recipients will get the largest grants, of $3 million each. One of them is El Sol Neighborhood Education Center in California, where project director Alexander Fajardo says the money will go toward basic and advanced training for more than 250 community health workers.\n\n“As a community-based organization, we have had challenges to really be able to reach this federal funding for years,” he told CNN. “The big entities like universities or these big players, it’s hard for us to compete with them.”\n\nA CNN report earlier this year described how some community health organizations – especially smaller, grassroots groups – struggled to navigate bureaucracy and access funds, even as they provided critical assistance to the US Covid-19 response.\n\nCommunity health workers, also known as promotores, “are people from the community. They speak the same language; they face the same challenges,” Fajardo said. “Those qualities make them more effective when they are doing the work in the community. Because when they are talking about Covid-19 or diabetes or any situation, they relate with it. They have the same experience. ‘He’s my neighbor.

The work her agency is doing, along with funding efforts by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is aimed at changing that.\n\n“This is a moment when young people are really interested in and engaged in public health, and being able to give them experiences where they can start down a career path and give us an opportunity to then help leverage that and get them on a career ladder in public health is just a huge win for all of us.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nSperling told CNN that the new grants alone “may not be a long-term solution” to underfunding in these crucial health areas, “but I think it’s going to provide the enthusiasm and results that will encourage more long-term investments.”\n\nThe administration’s aim is to “use these types of funds to build careers, to give people a chance to both serve their country during this pandemic but also build a public health career and to be professional community health workers that could make such a big difference,” he said.", "authors": ["Katherine Dillinger"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2023/12/31/new-fafsa-application-open/71934979007/", "title": "Hanging in the FAFSA waiting room? What to do to prepare as you ...", "text": "Editor's note: USA TODAY is updating this previously published story with more details on the soft launch of the new FAFSA form for the school year 2024-25.\n\nThe long-awaited simplified Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form to request financial help for the 2024-25 year is finally here -- though it may not have seemed like it for millions of Americans over the long New Year's holiday weekend.\n\nThe Department of Education officially \"soft\" launched the new FAFSA form on December 30 last weekend, about three months later than its usual Oct. 1 date, but only for 30 minutes, according to a Department of Education spokesperson on Tuesday. The application was also available for another 30 minutes on December 31 and two hours on January 1, the spokesperson said.\n\nIt's now open again periodically, with a waiting room to manage site volume and capacity, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe soft launch, which means that the form is available periodically, allows the government to \"monitor and respond in real time to any potential issues impacting the applicant experience,\" according to the Federal Student Aid website.\n\nFind the loan that's right for you: Best personal loans\n\nIn the two 30-minute windows the application was open on December 30 and 31, \"thousands of applications were successfully submitted,\" the spokesperson said. On January 1 during the two-hour window, \"over 30,000 applications were successfully submitted, and over 100,000 applications are in progress,\" they said, noting \"in progress\" generally means a user has completed their portion of the form and a contributor will need to complete their portion.\n\nWith tens of millions of students expected to complete FAFSA but only tens of thousands so far able to do so -- three months later than usual -- \"even by soft-launch standards, this weekend’s rollout was challenging and students, families, and financial aid administrators who have been waiting for this release for months are understandably frustrated,\" said Justin Draeger, president of nonprofit National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.\n\nStill, Federal Student Aid believes everyone will be able to complete the form on time. \"You will have plenty of time to complete the FAFSA form,\" the website reads. \"If you do submit your form during the soft launch, your information will be saved, and you won’t need to resubmit your form or any related information. If your form is unavailable when you or your family members try to access it, please try again later.\"\n\nAbout 18 million FAFSAs were submitted during the 2020-21 application cycle, according to Federal Student Aid data.\n\nFor the 2024-25 school year, FAFSA will be reduced to just 36 questions from 108, including detailed financial information, and it will be easier to import income data from tax records. Along with the pared-down form, the Department of Education changed its formulas so, among other things, more students would be awarded Pell Grants, which don't have to be repaid. It also will no longer include a sibling discount so families with more than one child in college may get less aid.\n\nThe goal of the new FAFSA form is to make it easier for students and families to get money to pay for school. Studies show millions of students who are eligible for financial aid don't complete the application for various reasons and miss out on billions of dollars for school. Part of the solution to get more people to apply was to simplify the process and make more people eligible for grants. But the lateness in getting it out may have complicated things for those who have to complete it this year. Schools won't even receive any information they need to determine aid until the end of January, the Department of Education said.\n\nSince no other deadlines for submission or decisions have been moved back, the entire process has been compressed, making it more important than ever to stay calm, focused, organized and get everything right the first time or risk leaving money on the table.\n\nHere are some of what to expect and tips to help maximize your time and chances to get every penny you can for school:\n\nLess time, maybe less support. Due to the shortened timeline, students and families not only have less time to complete FAFSA but may not get as much help as they normally would. So, make sure you know the requirements of schools you’re interested in. “Those states with FAFSA completion as a high school graduation requirement will be operating under immense pressure to support students in a timely manner and ensure all requirements are met,\" the National College Attainment Network warned in a statement in November.\n\nDue to the shortened timeline, students and families not only have less time to complete FAFSA but may not get as much help as they normally would.

Questions, additions and corrections. If you need to make corrections or additions, answer school questions, or provide more information, you won't be able to until February at the earliest, further delaying financial aid offers, said Shannon Vasconcelos, Bright Horizons college coach, a unit of childcare operator Bright Horizons. So, make sure “to get all your ducks in a row upfront,” she said. “Prepare and send any information upfront if you have special circumstances -- if the tax year 2022 information for the 2024-25 FAFSA is no longer representative of your financial situation. There’s no time for a lot of back and forth.\" Also, send your information to all the schools you’re even just considering so there’s no delay if you decide to apply. If you don’t, the school just won’t do anything with information and there’s no harm.\n\nIf you need to make corrections or additions, answer school questions, or provide more information, you won't be able to until February at the earliest, further delaying financial aid offers, said Shannon Vasconcelos, Bright Horizons college coach, a unit of childcare operator Bright Horizons.

Most states don’t require a separate form for state aid, but applicants in Iowa, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont do. You’ll have to find and complete the state application or potentially lose out, Vasconcelos said.\n\nThe new FAFSA won’t include links to state aid applications this year.

The terrain there is so rural that only airplanes and snowmobiles connect the district’s 11 tiny villages.\n\nShepherd is one of more than 7,000 teachers in his state trying to make the most of teaching his students since the governor closed schools to in-person learning to stop the spread of the coronavirus. One method he isn’t relying on: online learning.\n\n“Around half of my students have access to the internet on some device at home,” Shepherd said. “Internet service is very expensive in rural Alaska and comes with data caps. Internet service is also prone to interruptions due to weather.”\n\nFor those who already have service, there’s help: Across the nation, many internet providers have agreed to waive late fees and end disconnects for families in financial hardship. But millions without high-speed internet at home have been left to fend for themselves as governments shut down their school buildings and mandate distance learning.\n\nFor many, school likely out until summer:Will states need to hold kids back, institute summer school?\n\nLatest coronavirus news:US tops 4,000 deaths; Navy seeks to isolate sick sailors in Guam\n\nA study by Microsoft in 2018 estimated that about half of Americans – 163 million people – do not have high-speed internet at home.\n\nStudents in rural areas often find it impossible to connect to internet service at speeds that would allow conferencing or video streaming because internet providers haven’t extended the lines. Elsewhere, especially in urban districts with high concentrations of poor students, subscribing is too expensive.\n\nThe federal government's nearly $2 trillion stimulus package doesn't address this digital divide, even though nearly all American schools are closed. A $2 billion proposal from Democrats to help expand online access didn’t make it out of the Senate last week, according to Politico. A $50 million proposal from the Trump administration didn’t either.\n\nSchool districts and teachers such as Shepherd are stepping up. With their close ties to their communities, educators are striving to maintain normalcy for their students in a time of crisis. Teachers, principals and superintendents are delivering take-home work, setting up mobile Wi-Fi hot spots and lobbying their states for broadband reform.\n\nOn Wednesday, Google said it would help address the problem in California, where in-person school is expected to be canceled for the rest of the academic year. The internet search company will provide free Wi-Fi to 100,000 rural California families through the end of the school year, plus 4,000 Chromebook laptops for students.\n\nThey're also teaching on TV:With schools closed from coronavirus, these teachers turn to PBS, Fox\n\nShepherd said most of his contact with students in Alaska is now through telephone conferences. The school district prepared work packets for students to complete and skills workbooks for them to do by hand. And he’s challenging his students to go outside as much as possible.\n\nThe problem stretches beyond rural America. In Phoenix, three high school students were found huddled under a blanket outside a closed elementary school, the president of the city's school board said. They couldn’t connect to the internet from home, so they camped out to access the school's Wi-Fi to do their homework.\n\nThe district's superintendent joined nearly 50 others from around Arizona in sending an open letter to state leaders asking for help.\n\n“The only way for Arizona to educate its 1.1 million K-12 students during a statewide closure will be, primarily, through some form of online or virtual learning,” the superintendents wrote.\n\n“Equitable access to technology (both devices and internet access) is already a major challenge. This crisis, however, will simply shed light on a major disparity that has long existed in Arizona.”\n\nIs online school illegal? With schools closing from coronavirus, special education concerns give districts pause\n\nThey need broadband now. They’ve waited for years.\n\nTens of millions of people across the United States have waited for access to broadband internet for as long as their friends and loved ones in other places have enjoyed home service.\n\nCongress declined to regulate the internet as a utility in 1996, a decision that means no agency can force providers to run broadband cables to homes or set pricing.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission decided in the early 2000s not to regulate the internet as a telephone service, a decision that would take an act of Congress to change.\n\nInstead of utility-type regulation, the FCC has spent hundreds of billions of dollars paying incentives to encourage internet service providers to improve access to rural areas. Often, that money does not require companies to offer speeds high enough to allow a videoconference or streaming a video.\n\nDespite that spending, according to research on broadband usage by Microsoft, about half of Americans – 163 million – still did not have high-speed internet service at home in 2018. Many of those are families who can't afford it or have chosen not to get it. But the FCC estimated in 2017 that at least 21 million Americans could not hook up because there were no connections nearby and there was no likelihood a company would provide one anytime soon.\n\nWhen it comes to online learning, speed matters. Amelia Ross can do her schoolwork from home – she just has to make sure no one else is online first.\n\n\"We have internet,\" Amelia said of her home in Milton, a hamlet in rural eastern Indiana. \"It's just very slow. If anybody else in the house is on the internet, it's really hard to do things.\"\n\nHer oldest brother stayed at Butler University, which has also moved to online classes, so he wouldn’t have to share laggy internet service with Amelia and another brother.\n\nHow online college classes are working:A rapping professor. A cat in class. Pornography on Zoom.\n\nIn Culberson County, Texas, about a two-hour drive from El Paso, Microsoft estimates that just 4% of the population uses the internet at broadband speeds. Local band director David Deluca knows what that means for his students.\n\n“Probably less than half of my students have access to the internet when they're away from school,” Deluca said. “Internet is available in our town. I have it in my little duplex, but many of our families either cannot afford it or choose to spend their money in different ways.”\n\nIn a town just outside Waco, Texas, high school teacher Tanya Snook is adjusting to classes that went online starting Monday. She doesn’t know how many of her 111 students have internet service at home, but she’s sure some of them don’t because they live in poverty.\n\n“I am very worried about my students who don’t have laptops,” Snook said, “and I am trying to make sure all my work can be done from a phone.”\n\nScreen time during coronavirus:Yes, your kids are on screens because of coronavirus. No, you're not a terrible parent\n\n'Not even $1 billion' in the stimulus to connect students\n\nCongress could pay companies to extend high-speed lines as part of a stimulus package. The federal lawmakers did so in 2010, in an almost New Deal-like response to the Great Recession. But neither of the first two coronavirus relief bills that went through Congress addressed students’ access to broadband.\n\n“I cannot understand how the U.S. Senate can approve a $2 trillion emergency package and not find even $1 billion to ensure that every school child in America can connect to the internet on a functioning device,” James P. Steyer, CEO of Common Sense, a nonprofit education advocacy group, said in a statement last week.\n\n“Up to 12 million lower-income and many rural-based kids do not have adequate access to broadband or modern devices, impacting student outcomes and exacerbating economic inequality,” Steyer said. “Now that most American schoolkids must learn from home because of COVID-19, it is an even bigger problem.”\n\nThe stimulus bill, known as the CARES Act, provides $200 million to boost telehealth services. The FCC will have the authority to fund telehealth programs across the country quickly, freeing up inpatient capacity at hospitals, Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.\n\nIn his own statement, Commissioner Geoffrey Starks called on the FCC to provide its own “connectivity stimulus” to help bridge the digital divide for Americans, including schoolchildren. He said the FCC should assess its legal power and “take bold action to respond to the current crisis.”\n\nMeanwhile, the FCC is extending a deadline to apply for a federal program called e-rate that helps schools and libraries afford to upgrade their connections. The FCC is also relaxing rules to allow the general public to use those connections.\n\nAdditionally, Pai has urged internet service providers to take the “Keep America Connected” pledge. Companies that take the pledge promise they won’t disconnect customers for nonpayment, will waive late fees, and will open Wi-Fi hot spots to the general public.\n\nMore than 300 companies have signed the pledge, which asks for a 60-day commitment. But it’s not clear whether the companies will take these steps because there is no way to enforce the pledge. A spokesman for the FCC declined an interview on Pai’s behalf.\n\nCompanies and schools take matters into their own hands\n\nWithout a government mandate, some of the nation’s largest internet service providers and the smallest public schools are helping low-income families connect amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nComcast, one of the largest providers in the country, is offering a package with 25 megabits-per-second download speeds and 3 megabits-per-second upload speeds, the threshold for high-speed internet service, for $9.95 a month. The company also is upgrading its other packages to those speeds.\n\nCox has introduced a no-contract plan for $19.99 a month designed for low-income customers. The downloading speed is up to 50 megabits per second. The company also will relax data caps for many of its existing customers.\n\nThrough June 30, Verizon is tripling the data allowances for tablets and laptops at school districts that receive federal grants because they serve large populations of low-income students. The company estimates 116,000 students will benefit.\n\nIn Abilene, Texas – where Microsoft says only 48% of the surrounding county is using broadband – school district administrators want to turn 25 school buses into mobile Wi-Fi hot spots. The equipment to complete the project had not yet been delivered last week.\n\nIn the meantime, the district installed a stationary hot spot – one of five total in the city and its immediate surroundings – in the parking lot of its football stadium, where students can pull up in a vehicle to connect to a Wi-Fi signal.\n\nDawn Sandhop teaches first grade in Washington state in a rural district where 8,700 students live spread across 400 square miles. In Grant County, where she lives, 40% of the population uses the internet at broadband speeds.\n\nSandhop said her school waited until March 23 – two weeks after the governor ordered the schools to close – to implement e-learning. The school had ordered mobile Wi-Fi hot spots for kids without internet at home, and the devices were on backorder.\n\nOther districts are turning to paper.\n\nIn Parkston, South Dakota, the district surveyed families to find out which ones did not have internet access in order to design an e-learning program, according to superintendent Shayne McIntosh. The district found fewer than 10 families in that situation.\n\nTo serve those students, the district prints out hardcopies of work and puts them in packets for the students to do at home. Families pick up and drop off students' work at the school, and if they can't, a staff member will deliver.\n\nAfter families turn the completed work back in, teachers wait 72 hours to grade it to make sure any virus on the schoolwork has died.\n\nSocial distancing? New Jersey parents stand together in long lines to get school materials for their children\n\nContributing: Arika Herron, The Indianapolis Star; Timothy Chipp, Abilene Reporter-News (Texas)\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story used the wrong gender pronoun for Alaska teacher Corey Shepherd.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/05/20/dental-care-insurance-costs-too-much-aca-rule/73766660007/", "title": "Dental care and insurance costs too much. ACA rule could change that", "text": "Even when she had a massive infection and grueling pain from a cracked tooth, Nicole Sutton could not get a dentist to provide timely care.\n\nSutton, a single mother based in Tampa, Florida, could only get herself on a waitlist where she got in line to see one of the few dentists who take Medicaid, the government insurance for low-income families. She visited a hospital emergency room and a federally funded community health center, but those appointments only yielded prescriptions for antibiotics and pain pills. Neither offered to treat her dental crisis.\n\nIt wasn’t until she secured a loan from a friend that she could afford to see a specialist and an oral surgeon who extracted her tooth in an emergency procedure. Both demanded cash upfront.\n\nIt took months to clear the infection and return to health. The protracted dental episode two years ago exposed Sutton to the lurking disaster millions of Americans face because they don’t have robust dental insurance that guarantees access to oral care. A solution from the federal government may be forthcoming, which could have made a huge difference for Sutton.\n\n“A dental infection can kill you,” Sutton said. “Yes, there's pain, but it can also really impact your health.”\n\nIntroducing Affordable Care Act dental insurance\n\nAmericans experience dental emergencies every year and the U.S. health care system is ill-equipped to help them, according to advocates.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act extended health insurance to tens of millions of Americans, through federal and state marketplaces that sell subsidized health insurance and Medicaid expansion adopted by all but 10 states.\n\nBut President Barack Obama's signature 2010 health care law excluded dental coverage for adults. The health law required states to offer pediatric dental care as an essential health benefit for ACA plans.\n\nIn a move last month that received little fanfare, the Biden administration finalized a rule that would give states the option of adding adult dental insurance coverage as part of their Affordable Care Act plans.\n\nIn another attempt to bolster dental coverage, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on Friday introduced the Comprehensive Dental Care Reform Act of 2024, a bill that would expand dental coverage through Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration and increase the number of dentists, dental hygienists and dental therapists nationwide.\n\nThe deficit in dental coverage is immense: Nearly 69 million U.S. adults did not have dental insurance or access to routine oral health care last year, according to a survey by the nonprofit CareQuest Institute for Oral Health. Millions more lost dental insurance last year when states began to unwind Medicaid coverage for people who signed up during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPeople who don't have coverage often wait before seeking care, and minor infections turn into life-threatening ordeals, advocates say. Those who rely on safety net programs such as Medicaid or community health centers that are federally qualified often end up on wait lists and struggle to get timely dental appointments. Only 1 in 3 U.S. dentists agree to take care of Medicaid patients. Even fewer dentists see a lot of Medicaid patients.\n\nDentists can limit which insurance plans they take and require uninsured patients to pay cash upfront. Others steer patients to credit-card-style companies that extend credit with high interest rates. Under the arrangement, dentists get paid immediately, and patients get bills and face high-interest penalties if they don't pay the balance during a grace period of several months.\n\nAdvocates like Melissa Burroughs, director of public policy at CareQuest Institute for Oral Health, aim to level the playing field, making dental care accessible to all.\n\n“For far too many people in this country, oral health care is unaffordable and out of reach,” Burroughs said. “And that's largely because there are very significant gaps in insurance.”\n\nUnder Biden's rule, states have until 2025 to decide whether to mandate that insurers cover dental benefits for adults. The dental benefits would not take effect until 2027. No states have publicly signaled yet that they intend to require ACA dental benefits in 2027, however, advocates say the new rule could represent a significant expansion of dental insurance, which gets less scrutiny than medical insurance for hospital, doctor and pharmacy bills.\n\nSanders has rallied for dental reforms for more than a decade. In 2022, the senator unsuccessfully pushed for Medicare to provide comprehensive dental coverage for older Americans. During a hearing Thursday of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee he chairs, Sanders said tens of millions of American adults either can't afford or are unable to get necessary dental care. The hearing featured testimony from dentists, advocates and academics who discussed the depths of the challenge of providing nationwide oral care access.\n\n\"This is an issue we do not discuss enough,\" Sanders told the committee. \"It is a crisis issue.\"\n\nAdvocates cheered the renewed attention to dental health insurance. The Biden rule is \"pretty monumental\" because it could pave the way for more robust dental coverage, said Colin Reusch, senior adviser for oral health policy at Community Catalyst, a health advocacy organization.\n\nReusch said about a half dozen states have previously explored the possibility of adding adult dental benefits, but, he said, it's too early to say whether any would consider adding coverage under the Biden rule.\n\nAmericans are more likely to skip dental care because of the cost than to forego other types of health care such as costly doctor visits or prescriptions.\n\nDental coverage and access is \"one of the places where people face significant affordability barriers,\" Reusch said. \"In fact, dental coverage presents a higher out-of-pocket burden compared to just about any other category of health care.\"\n\n'Beauty and smiles' stymied by gum disease\n\nNew York City native Shaena Morris became accustomed to top-notch medical and dental care as a child and young adult. She took diligent care of her teeth, getting routine cleanings and checkups.\n\nBut when she moved to Florida with her family a decade ago, she could no longer count on timely appointments or access to care.\n\nWhen her gums became inflamed after the birth of her first child, one dentist recommended a $4,000 deep cleaning that her dental insurer, Medicaid, would not cover. Now a resident of Dania Beach, Florida, Morris has cycled on and off of a public health insurance program as her household income has changed. Even when she's on Medicaid, she often cannot get timely appointments or coverage of dental specialists that she needs.\n\nBeyond dealing with pain and discomfort, she feels her inconsistent dental care has harmed her career as a cosmetologist doing hair and makeup for the likes of Paris Hilton. She believes her clients and managers have noticed her dental problems. She ultimately walked away from a profession she'd been in for nearly two decades because of what limited dental care did to her oral health.\n\n\"Beauty and smiles − that's my life,\" Morris said. \"My talent can no longer sustain me because people need you to look like Photoshop.\"\n\nDental care and job prospects\n\nAbout 30% of low-income adults nationwide and nearly 60% of Medicaid beneficiaries without dental access believe the appearance of their mouth and teeth has limited their ability to interview for a job, according to a document filed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services as part of the rule change.\n\n\"Try to get a job without any teeth in your mouth,\" Sanders proposed. \"Good luck, because you're not going to get it.\"\n\nDelayed dental care doesn't just impact appearance and job prospects, it's also linked to an array of medical problems. Nearly half of U.S. adults have periodontal disease and more than 40% of children have developed tooth decay by Kindergarten.\n\nPoor oral health is also associated with risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, dementia and adverse birth outcomes, research shows.\n\nLisa Simon worked as a dentist in a community health center where the waiting period for an appointment often exceeded four months. She said she routinely had to extract teeth that she could have saved if Medicaid funding had been sufficient to get patients timely appointments.\n\nNow an internal medicine doctor at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Simon sees more adult patients who have never been to a dentist, including people hospitalized with life-threatening sepsis that resulted from an untended dental infection. Other patients who couldn't afford to remove infected teeth and had to delay chemotherapy. Doctors often recommend patients get dental infections treated before starting chemotherapy.\n\n\"Both my medical and dental patients asked me the same question: Why is it so hard for me to get dental care?\" Simon said. \"There is no good reason.\"\n\nDental infection turns fatal\n\nDentists say the costs of operating a practice, including hiring support staff and hygienists, make it difficult financially for them to take a large number of Medicaid patients. Young dentists often must repay student loans that typically carry higher balances than what medical students owe. The low reimbursement rates from Medicaid make it difficult for some practices to make ends meet.\n\nThese issues are especially acute in rural communities that face dental provider shortages. Young dentists who must repay hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans may be reluctant to practice in rural communities with higher rates of uninsured patients. Two-thirds of rural communities nationwide are designated as having a shortage of dental professional, Sanders said.\n\nDr. Gordon Roswell Isbell III, who runs a dental practice with his son in Gadsden, Alabama, said the economic and workforce challenges for independent dentists are daunting. His practice employs six dental hygienists who are all near retirement age.\n\nInsurance payments have decreased as business costs have risen, Isbell said, which makes it hard to keep the business afloat.\n\nDentists who are just getting out of school have a long way to go, said Brian Jeffrey Swann, a private and public health oral physician who lives in Greenback, Tennessee, and also practices in North Carolina and Massachusetts. \"It's going to take them five to seven years before they start breaking even,\" he said.\n\nSwann serves on the board of Remote Area Medical, a nonprofit that provides care at pop-up dental, vision and medical clinics around the U.S. at no cost to patients. People flock to these clinics, often driving across state lines to access care from dentists, hygienists and other volunteer health care workers. Some arrive days in advance of the clinics, sleeping in cars and wrapped in blankets, just to get a chance at free dental or other health care, Swann said.\n\nSwann recounted the case of a 27-year-old Appalachian woman who had a range of health problems and developed swelling under her chin because of an infected, decaying molar. She went to a hospital emergency room where she was given antibiotics and pain pills and instructed to seek dental care.\n\nShe visited a dentist who told her it would cost $900 to remove the infected molar.

Please, don't ...", "text": "Rachel Beale\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMy life changed on March 17, 2021. I went to bed completely unaware of how badly I could be impacted, as a healthy person, by COVID-19, and woke up to the start of a chronic illness that has profoundly altered my life.\n\nThat day, I tested positive for COVID-19 and experienced high fever, intense body pains, fatigue and headache. Despite feeling unwell, I managed to care for myself at home and began to feel better after about two weeks, eager to resume my normal routine. It never occurred to me that I might not bounce back.\n\nI struggled to juggle what used to be routine – caring for my three children and my responsibilities at work – with new challenges including extreme fatigue, chronic pain and neurological issues. As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, my symptoms persisted.\n\nIt’s been three years, and I continue to wake up feeling tired, nauseous and dizzy, immediately planning when I can lie down again. My brain fog feels like I have cobwebs inside my head.\n\nBefore long COVID, I was active and healthy. I was driven and ambitious. I put myself through college, earned an MBA at night and pursued a career in human resources. I loved my job as the director of human resources at a local community college.\n\nI felt like I had “made it” until the onset of long COVID created a seismic shift in my life, creating a clear divide between the before Rachel and the after Rachel.\n\nCOVID, flu and RSV are still here.The 'tripledemic' doesn't care that we're over being sick.\n\nLong COVID has taken my job, health and time with kids\n\nDespite my efforts to return to work, I ultimately lost my job. I could only work for about an hour before my headaches became debilitating. I started out using sick days, then went on short-term disability and eventually transitioned to long-term disability, at which point – because of my role in HR – I knew I’d be separated from my position.\n\nI used to have the very same meetings with employees. Because of this, I was aware of what the next step was, and that it was completely out of my control. Losing my job was devastating, and it’s been hard to accept that I no longer have a career.\n\nMy family and I have adapted to my illness, planning activities around my energy levels. On good days, I have a few hours of energy, but events like birthdays or holidays require careful planning. Sometimes I need to recover for days afterward.\n\nIt was normal for me to go to school assemblies or shuttle my kids to their school activities after a full day of work, but now I need to plan to get as much rest as possible so that I can cheer on my kids. I used to work out every day, but now I need oxygen to catch my breath after a long conversation.\n\nDaily errands like going to the grocery store are challenging; it can feel like sensory overload. There have been times when I felt too dizzy to finish shopping and my children had to help me get back to the car.\n\nWe used to enjoy day trips to hike in the mountains or go to the beach. I used to cook dinner and do bedtime and bathtime with my kids, but I sleep through that most evenings.\n\nLong COVID has taken my job, my health and my quality time with the kids.\n\nEach day, I battle with a profound sense of loss – of identity, purpose and the confidence and vitality that once defined me. Encounters with familiar faces in my small town serve as reminders of my old life. It’s hard not to be filled with depression and grief, as I watch my life go by in front of me while time moves on for others.\n\nBernie Sanders:US is turning its back on long COVID. We'll pay the price if we don't act.\n\nMillions suffering from long COVID can't be left behind\n\nI’ve heard people say COVID is just a cold. What people don’t realize is the impact long COVID can have on your brain, lungs and other body systems.\n\nI am proof of that. I was not at high risk for COVID and was patiently waiting my turn to get vaccinated when I was infected, and we know now that the COVID vaccine can protect you against severe COVID infection, which can increase the likelihood of developing long COVID.\n\nWith the virus continually evolving, the latest vaccine is the most effective way to boost your immunity.\n\nBelieve me – long COVID is a disease that can have a significant impact on your quality of life.\n\nIt’s difficult to have faith while navigating an illness without a cure. People say don't lose hope, but I don't know all the damage that COVID has done to my body. It's hard for me to stay positive with so many unknowns.\n\nMillions of us who are suffering eagerly await progress in research and therapies. At least 65 million people are living with long COVID worldwide, including 16 million working-age Americans. I want to encourage all the scientists, researchers, elected leaders and everybody working toward a treatment for long COVID to keep at it, because we need the treatment now.\n\nIn the meantime, I’ll try to make the most of my new reality and find peace with sharing my story and raising awareness to hopefully help others.\n\nRachel Beale, MBA, is a long COVID-19 advocate and mother of three from Southampton County in Virginia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/27/national-make-a-difference-day/1662851/", "title": "Millions turn out for national Make A Difference Day", "text": "Make A Difference Day is nation's largest day of service\n\n3 million volunteers spent the day helping their communities\n\nMake A Difference Day was created by USA WEEKEND Magazine\n\nMake A Difference Day made its mark on America on Saturday.

Here's what to know about the ...", "text": "Instagram has officially launched its new Teen Accounts feature, marking one of Meta's biggest efforts to date to bolster safety for its youngest users online.\n\nThe new accounts, automatically assigned to any new users under the age of 18, place limits on what users can see, who can message and interact with them, and enable parents to exercise more control over their teens' social media use.\n\nMeta promised the rollout of additional safety features earlier this year after it came under fire in both the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps are addictive and have fueled a youth mental health crisis.\n\nIn October, more than 40 states filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the social media company profited from the advertising revenue gained by intentionally designing features on Instagram and Facebook to maximize the time teens and children spent on the platforms.\n\nMeta said in a statement at the time that it shares the “commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online,\" adding, “We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path.\"\n\nNow, users will start to see some of the promised changes.\n\nWhat is an Instagram Teen Account?\n\nEvery new Instagram user under the age of 18 will automatically be signed up for a Teen Account, which regulates how they view and interact with the app and gives parents specific controls over their teen's experience on the app.\n\nThese accounts come with unique features designed to limit teen activity on the app, including messaging and inappropriate content restrictions, automatic private accounts and time limits set by parents.\n\nThe accounts can be changed to have less strict settings, but teens under 16 will need their parent's permission to make this change.\n\n\"We know parents want to feel confident that their teens can use social media to connect with their friends and explore their interests, without having to worry about unsafe or inappropriate experiences,\" Instagram said in a press release. \"This new experience is designed to better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place.\"\n\nThe content that's viewable via the Teen Account is filtered by the most stringent settings, hiding content classified as \"sensitive\" even when shared by someone they follow. The accounts also notify the app not to suggest anything marked as potentially sensitive to these accounts in the first place. This applies not only to traditional posts but Reels and suggested accounts as well.\n\nSensitive posts can include things like sexually suggestive content, content discussing suicide, self-harm or disordered eating, images of violence including fights caught on camera and posts discussing plastic surgery procedures.\n\nTeens will also get access to a new Explore feature that allows them to select topics they want to see more posts about, allowing them to further tailor what comes across their pages.\n\nMessaging is also restricted by default on Teen Accounts, meaning they can only be messaged by people they follow or are already connected to. Teen Accounts can also only be tagged or mentioned by people they follow and come equipped with Instagram's tightest anti-bullying settings, meaning offensive words and phrases will be filtered out of comments and DM requests.\n\nHow will Instagram enforce Teen Accounts?\n\nInstagram also has plans to enforce these age restrictions even when teens attempt to circumvent them by lying about their birth dates or attempting to gain parental control over each other's accounts.\n\nAccount creators will be asked to verify their age using ID, and additional verification steps will be added. Since 2022, teens have been required to prove their age with a video selfie or ID check if they attempt to change their birthday from under the age of 18 to over 18. If a teen attempts to update their birthday from a younger age to an older age, the platform requires proof of age with an ID check.\n\nFurther steps will include using information about a teen’s original account to prevent them from using a new account with an adult age or preventing teens from linking their accounts to accounts with adult ages.\n\nLikewise, Instagram is working on an AI model that can detect if someone is likely to be underage even if they put an adult birthday in at the account signup. By using clues like a review of the accounts and types of content an account is interacting with, the AI tech, which has yet to be rolled out, may automatically switch an account over to a teen version, though account holders will be able to change this setting.\n\nParental control features\n\nParental controls are a major part of the new Teen Accounts, as Instagram said its inspiration for the new features came from feedback on parents' most common concerns.\n\nParents can set up parental supervision on their teens' accounts, which enables them to approve and deny their teens’ requests to change settings or allow teens to manage their settings themselves and gives parents access to optional monitoring tools.\n\nUsing these tools, parents can see the topics their teens are looking at and get a look at who they are chatting with. While parents can't read their children's messages or see which posts they view directly, they can see who their teen has messaged in the past seven days and what topics they have opted to see more of on their feeds.\n\nA few more of these parental tools allow users to limit the amount of time spent on Instagram. Some of these include:\n\nTime limit reminders : Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day.\n\n: Teens will get notifications telling them to leave the app after 60 minutes each day. Sleep mode enabled : Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs.\n\n: Sleep mode will be turned on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight and send auto-replies to DMs. Set total daily time limits for teens’ Instagram usage: Parents can decide how much time their teen can spend on Instagram each day. Once a teen hits that limit, they’ll no longer be able to access the app.\n\nHow to get an Instagram Teen Account\n\nInstagram began placing all teens under 18 who sign up for a new account on Teen Accounts starting Tuesday, but existing accounts belonging to teenagers will not automatically transfer quite yet.\n\nAccording to the company, Instagram plans to move existing accounts owned by teenagers over to Teen Accounts within the next 60 days in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, and elsewhere starting in January.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/07/27/instagram-teen-safety-update-facebook-mark-zuckerberg/5381319001/", "title": "How Facebook hopes to protect teen Instagram users with privacy ...", "text": "Facing an onslaught of ongoing criticism, Facebook said that it's taking several steps to make Instagram safer and private for teens.\n\nOn Tuesday, the social network said it's making changes to Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing app with more than 1 billion users. They include automatically defaulting teen users under 16 into private accounts, making it harder for potentially suspicious accounts to find teens, limiting the options advertisers have to reach those younger viewer with ads, and using AI to detect users' age.\n\n\"We think private accounts are the right choice for young people, but we recognize some young creators might want to have public accounts to build a following,\" Instagram said in a blog post. \"We want to strike the right balance of giving young people all the things they love about Instagram while also keeping them safe.\"\n\nWhile the changes on Instagram starting Tuesday are praised by several tech experts, they also face criticism from other experts who raised several questions including whether the changes have been vetted by federal regulators and whether Instagram is doing enough to make young people safe.\n\n\"We've been telling Facebook for years to stop targeting to teens on both Facebook and Instagram and to protect their privacy,\" said Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. \"We have a lot of questions. We're not alone.\"\n\nThe changes on Instagram also come amid ongoing momentum among several groups and lawmakers to collectively stop a potential Instagram for kids. In May, Facebook received more than 180,000 signatures in a series of petitions from a collective of nonprofit and grassroots organizations including Fairplay (formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood), SumOfUs, and a joint effort led by the Juggernaut Project all urging the tech giant to scrap its plans for an Instagram for kids.\n\nThe groups collectively claim that a version of Instagram – the popular photo- and video-sharing app with more than 1 billion users – is unsuitable for kids under 13.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook says it's \"exploring\" a version of Instagram for kids. The company said it will make safety and privacy a priority and \"consult with experts in child development, child safety, and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it.\" Facebook also said it will \"not show ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13.\"\n\nThe strategy is backed by both Instagram Head Adam Mosseri and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who told lawmakers in March that plans for an Instagram for kids are in \"very early stages.\"\n\nCurrently, Instagram doesn't allow users under 13 to use the platform. But, in regards to Instagram's teen safety update taking effect on Tuesday, the platform admitted that creating a safe, private but also fun site \"comes with competing challenges.\"\n\nCutting off funding for hate groups:PayPal working with Anti-Defamation League on research into funding for extremist groups\n\nThey also want to go gaming:Video games playing on the minds of Amazon, Netflix, Peloton and Zoom\n\nUsers under 16 now defaulted into private accounts\n\nInstagram said everyone who is under 16 years old (or under 18 in certain countries) will be defaulted into a private account when they join the platform.\n\nInstagram said it previously let younger users choose between a public account or a private account when they signed up, but said recent research showed they appreciated \"a more private experience.\" Instagram added recent testing showed that eight out of 10 young people accepted the private default settings when signing up.\n\nInstagram said for young users who currently have a public account, they will send a notification \"highlighting the benefits of a private account\" and explain how they can change their settings.\n\n\"We’ll still give young people the choice to switch to a public account or keep their current account public if they wish,\" Instagram said.\n\nIn the blog, David Kleeman, a senior vice president for global trends at United Kingdom-based Dubit and a former president of the American Center for Children and Media said, \"Defaulting accounts to private for under-16s encourages young people to develop comfort, confidence and capability as digital citizens during their younger years and help them develop habits to last a lifetime.\"\n\nHowever, Josh Golin, Fairplay's executive director, believes the decision to make Instagram accounts for teens private by default are also part of Facebook's commitment to comply with the Age Appropriate Design Code (AADC) in the UK. According to the AADC, Facebook and other tech companies must set the most privacy protective setting by default for users 18 and under by Sept. 2.\n\nAlso, Instagram said it has developed a tool that automatically detects potentially suspicious adult accounts and stops them from interacting with teen user accounts. For example, an adult's account might be marked as suspicious if it has been blocked or reported by multiple teen users.\n\nAnd in a few weeks, advertisers will soon be restricted in how they can target users under age 18 on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Advertisers will be allowed to target younger users based only on their ages, genders and locations and will no longer be able to target them based on their interests or activities on other websites and apps, Facebook said.\n\nHow AI might help\n\nIn an article written by Pavni Diwanji, Facebook's vice president of youth products, the AADC \"has been a model example of how Facebook can play a role in informing, and subsequently implementing, thoughtful age-appropriate solutions to protect young people on our services.\"\n\nDiwanji also said Facebook is creating new ways to stop those who are underage from signing up, and \"developing AI to find and remove underaged accounts,\" and new solutions to verify and estimate a user’s age.\n\nDiwanji wrote they will \"train the technology using multiple signals,\" including when a young user gets birthday messages and and the age written in those messages as well the age users gave on Facebook.\n\n\"(We'll) apply it to our other apps where you have linked your accounts and vice versa – so if you share your birthday with us on Facebook, we’ll use the same for your linked account on Instagram,\" said Diwanji, who admits it's a work in progress as the company is also developing options for users to prove their age.\n\n\"This technology isn’t perfect, and we’re always working to improve it, but that’s why it’s important we use it alongside many other signals to understand people’s ages,\" Diwanji added. \"This technology is also the basis of important changes we’re making to keep young people safe.\"\n\n\"We routinely recommend that teens have all of their social media profiles set to private so that they have better control over who can see what they post,\" Justin Patchin, co-director, Cyberbullying Research Center, said in the Instagram post. \"Defaulting to private just makes sense as adolescents explore the boundaries of what they want to share with whom.\"\n\nAlthough he remains \"skeptical,\" Golin, the Fairplay executive, said on the surface, Facebook and Instagram are taking much needed appropriate steps.\n\n\"I hope these are real changes,\" Golin said. \"We'll see when this rolls out if this lives up to the hype.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy said he has concerns and has reached out to the Federal Trade Commission to ask it to review Instagram's changes.\n\nTitania Jordan, a chief parenting officer for Bark, an Atlanta-based tech watchdog group, said Monday that while it's \"wonderful\" seeing Instagram and Facebook release specific, concrete ways they believe will work to keep children safer online, she also has many concerns.\n\nShe said even though Instagram appears to be addressing online predation, underage users, and advertising standards for teens, they also must be mindful of other issues including cyberbullying, suicidal ideation, self-harm and exposure to misinformation, violent, and sexual content.\n\nFacebook's Diwanji said in her article that \"with no foolproof way to stop (young) people from misrepresenting their age, we want to build experiences designed specifically for them, managed by parents and guardians.\"\n\nDwanji added, \"We believe that encouraging (young users) to use an experience that is age appropriate and managed by parents is the right path. It’s going to take a village to make this experience compelling enough so that this age group wants to use it, but we’re determined to get it right.\"\n\nThe mother of a pre-teen, Jordan also said that parents need to be constantly notified by both Facebook and Instagram about options to protect their kids.\n\n\"Parents are on the front lines when it comes to protecting their children, both online and in real life,\" Jordan said. \"If Instagram and Facebook aren't involving the parents in thoughtful and empowering ways, it's not going to work.\"\n\nIn its blog, Instagram said it is committed to listening to its younger users, their parents, lawmakers and experts to build a platform that won't \"compromise on their privacy and safety,\" and is trusted.\n\nOne tech accountability expert said he's curious to see if Facebook will do what it promises.\n\n\"These long overdue changes are an important acknowledgment from Facebook of the many harms kids and teens face on their platforms, from manipulative product designs and pervasive surveillance advertising to unwanted contact from predators,\" said Jesse Lehrich, co-founder of Accountable Tech, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. \"It should not take years of tireless advocacy from child safety and tech accountability NGOs to earn bare minimum protections for platforms' most vulnerable users, but it nonetheless speaks to the unprecedented pressure Big Tech is facing over their exploitative business practices.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2024/01/09/facebook-instagram-teens-new-meta-restrictions/72161105007/", "title": "Teens on Facebook, Instagram: What to know about new Meta ...", "text": "Teens on Facebook and Instagram may soon find that some content that once proliferated on their feeds is no longer visible to them – even if they search for it.\n\nMeta, the parent company of the social media platforms, revealed Tuesday it will begin restricting some of what young users can see on Facebook and Instagram. The announcement comes as the company faces mounting pressure from regulators who claim its social media sites are addictive and harmful to the mental health of younger users.\n\nIn a blog post, Meta said the measures, which will roll out in the coming weeks, are designed “to give teens more age-appropriate experiences on our apps.\" The protections will make it more difficult for teens to view and search for sensitive content such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders, according to Meta.\n\nHere's what to know about the changes:\n\nMeta faces federal lawsuit related to young users\n\nMeta has come under fire in recent months in both the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps are addictive and have fueled a youth mental health crisis.\n\nIn October, more than 40 states filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the social media company profited from the advertising revenue gained by intentionally designing features on Instagram and Facebook to maximize the time teens and children spent on the platforms.\n\nComing after a two-year multistate investigation, the lawsuit cited several studies – including Meta's own research – showing links between young people's use of Instagram and Facebook with depression, anxiety and other health problems. Attorneys claimed in the lawsuit that the sites' algorithms trigger releases of the pleasure chemical dopamine in young users that encourages them to continue scrolling, \"much like a gambler at a slot machine.\"\n\nMeta said in a statement at the time that it shares the “commitment to providing teens with safe, positive experiences online.\"\n\n“We’re disappointed that instead of working productively with companies across the industry to create clear, age-appropriate standards for the many apps teens use, the attorneys general have chosen this path,” the company said.\n\nMeta to update teen privacy settings, hide search terms\n\nMeta's new policy means that the profile of all users under 18 will soon default to the most restrictive settings.\n\nFor those accounts, certain types of content will be hidden on both Facebook and Instagram – even if shared by someone a teen follows – and certain search terms will be restricted. If a teen searchers for a restricted term related to suicide, self-harm or eating disorders, they will instead be directed toward “expert resources for help” like the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Meta said.\n\nWhile Meta will automatically set all teen accounts to the most stringent settings, the company acknowledged that these settings can be changed by users.\n\nTeen users will also be prompted to update their privacy settings themselves, the company said.\n\nFor those who turn on recommended privacy settings, Meta will automatically limit who can repost their content, tag or mention them, or include their content in Reels and remixes. Under these settings, only a user's followers can send messages and offensive comments will not be visible at all.\n\nMeta says it regularly consults experts on platform safety\n\nMeta's blog post did not specifically mention the legal action it faces, but the company said it regularly consults “with experts in adolescent development, psychology and mental health to help make our platforms safe.\"\n\n\"We’ve spent over a decade developing policies and technology to address content that breaks our rules or could be seen as sensitive,\" the company said.\n\nIn a statement, Rachel Rodgers, a psychologist at Northeastern University, called the measures \"an important step in making social media platforms spaces where teens can connect and be creative in age-appropriate ways.\"\n\n\"These policies reflect current understandings and expert guidance regarding teen’s safety and well-being,\" Rodgers said. \"As these changes unfold, they provide good opportunities for parents to talk with their teens about how to navigate difficult topics.”\n\nContributing: Mike Snider\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

But the dark side hasn't been dealt with,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said. “It's now time to deal with the dark side because people have taken your idea, and they've turned it into a nightmare for the American people.”\n\nConcerns about the harmful effects of social media use on America's youth have reached a crescendo in recent months. A public health advisory from the surgeon general last year noted social media use presents “a profound risk of harm” for kids' and teens' mental health and called for \"immediate action\" from tech companies.\n\n“We want action and legal accountability, not platitudes, from these CEOs,” said Brandy and Toney Roberts in a statement from the American Association for Justice. The couple filed a lawsuit against Meta after their 14-year-old daughter, Englyn, died by suicide. They say she was copying a hanging video sent to her on Instagram.\n\n\"An empty apology is cold comfort when we go home every night to Englyn’s empty bedroom,\" the Roberts said.\n\nLawmakers used the hearing to push for a package of bills meant “to help stop the exploitation of kids online,” including the STOP CSAM Act, which would allow victims of child exploitation to sue tech platforms.\n\nZuckerberg and other tech leaders argued that they have stepped up with protective measures that insulate children and teens on their platforms. Critics sharply disagreed.\n\n“I think Congress is going to have to help you,” Sen. John Kennedy, R-LA, said. “I think the reforms you're talking about, to some extent, are going to be like putting paint on rotten wood.\"\n\nAnd, even as they condemned social media companies, lawmakers acknowledged that they, too, have been part of the problem. Congress has passed just one kids' safety law in the past decade.\n\nWho are the witnesses?\n\nWitnesses include:\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nX CEO Linda Yaccarino\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew\n\nSnap CEO Evan Spiegel\n\nDiscord CEO Jason Citron\n\nThis was Zuckerberg’s eighth time testifying before Congress. It was a first for Yaccarino, Spiegel and Citron, who were subpoenaed to appear. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-IL, said Citron \"only accepted services of this subpoena after U.S. Marshals were sent to Discord's headquarters at taxpayer expense.\"\n\nThe tech company leaders said they were open to working with lawmakers to address their concerns.\n\n\"I sincerely hope today is the beginning of an ongoing dialogue that results in real improvements in online safety,\" Citron said.\n\nMark Zuckerberg to victims' families:'I'm sorry for everything you've been through'\n\nHighlights from the hearing\n\nZuckerberg turned down requests to expand child safety team: Lawmakers on Wednesday released internal documents from Meta that showed Zuckerberg rejected 2021 requests to add dozens of employees to focus on children’s well-being and safety.\n\n“(This) is the reason why we can no longer trust Meta, and, frankly, any of the other social media to in fact grade their own homework,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-CT.\n\nZuckerberg addressed the families of victims: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, urged Zuckerberg to apologize directly to the families of victims and suggested the billionaire establish a victim compensation fund. Zuckerberg would not commit to the idea during the hearing.\n\nTikTok grilled for ties to China: Lawmakers raised concerns that TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, is sharing user data with the Chinese government. CEO Chew argued that the company has spent billions on a project aimed at protecting American user data, and said the company has \"not been asked for any data by the Chinese government and we have never provided it.\"\n\nLawmakers highlight unity across party lines: The welfare of children on social media is the rare issue that transcends partisan politics. Sen. Graham highlighted how both Democrats and Republicans agreed that tech companies need more regulatory oversight.\n\n“We've found common ground here that just is astonishing,” he said.\n\nBoeing comparisons: Both Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, and Sen. Chris Coons, D-DE, contrasted regulations in the tech and airline industries, highlighting the quick response after a Boeing plane lost a panel midair earlier this month.\n\n\"Nobody questioned the decision to ground a fleet of over 700 planes. So why aren't we taking the same type of decisive action on the danger of these platforms when we know these kids are dying?\" Klobuchar asked.\n\nWhat do the platforms say?\n\nThe social media platform heads balked when asked if they support the five bills the committee is pushing as written, but say they have already taken steps to protect young users.\n\nYaccarino, head of X, said the company is building a content moderation center in Austin, Texas. She also noted that the company supports the STOP CSAM Act. TikTok CEO Chew highlighted safety measures, like disabling direct messaging for accounts owned by people under 16 and automatically making their accounts private.\n\nZuckerberg’s written testimony notes that Meta has introduced various features to help parents and teens, including controls that let parents set limits on when and how long their children can use Meta’s services − settings that hide potentially sensitive content and a nudge tool that reminds teens when they’ve been using Instagram for too long or too late into the night.\n\n\"We’re committed to protecting young people from abuse on our services, but this is an ongoing challenge,\" Zuckerberg says in his written testimony.\n\nSnap, the company behind instant messaging app Snapchat, and X also came out in support of the Kids Online Safety Act, which could lead to more lawsuits against tech companies that recommend harmful material to young users. (Some critics are concerned that it could also lead to the censorship of transgender content online.)\n\n“Just like with all technology and tools, there are people who exploit and abuse our platforms for immoral and illegal purposes,” Discord CEO Citron said. “All of us here on the panel today and throughout the tech industry, have a solemn and urgent responsibility to ensure that everyone who uses our platforms is protected from these criminals, both online and off.”\n\nLawmakers noted that a number of these safety measures – including X’s new content moderation center and additional protections for teens on Meta’s platforms – were added in the weeks leading up to the senate hearing.\n\nWhat do the lawmakers say?\n\nCritics say social media platforms' tools don’t go far enough, and hope the hearing will push lawmakers to take action. Politico reports that Congress has passed just one kids' safety law in the past decade.\n\n“I’m tired of talking. I’m tired of having discussions,” Graham said. “Open up the courthouse door.

Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive?Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2023/03/01/tiktok-screen-time-limit/11372810002/", "title": "TikTok releases screen time limit option for accounts under age 18", "text": "TikTok is rolling out a new screen time limit for users under 18.\n\nOn Wednesday, the social media platform announced \"changes to help teens manage their time on TikTok.\" Every account belonging to TikTok users under 18 years old will soon automatically set to a 60-minute daily screen limit, the company said.\n\nThe default time limit for eligible accounts is expected to arrive in the coming weeks.\n\nThere will still be an option for teen TikTokers to continue using the app beyond the 60-minute limit – but they will have to enter a prompted passcode, \"requiring them to make an active decision to extend that time,\" Cormac Keenan, head of trust and safety at TikTok, wrote in Wednesday's announcement.\n\n\"While there's no collectively-endorsed position on the 'right' amount of screen time or even the impact of screen time more broadly, we consulted the current academic research and experts from the Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children's Hospital in choosing this limit,\" Keenan wrote, while also citing research supported by TikTok.\n\nIn addition to mounting concerns surrounding the time teens spend on social media overall, TikTok's move arrives as the popular Chinese-owned app faces increased scrutiny in Washington over security concerns.\n\nWhite House:Federal agencies have 30 days to remove TikTok from government-issued devices\n\nTick-tock, TikTok:As Biden sets deadline for ban of social media app, here's what we know\n\nOn Monday, the White House announced that federal agencies have 30 days to remove TikTok from all government-issued devices, and House Republicans are pushing for a nationwide ban.

Steyer said TikTok's \"new features, particularly the screen time limits, are definitely a positive step to create a safer space for teens and families, but TikTok also needs to go further.\"\n\n\"TikTok continues to capture users' personal data and often nudges teens toward harmful content that can expose them to drugs, eating disorders, violence and more,\" Steyer continued. \"The nation's youth mental health crisis is rampant, and all social media companies need to make teens' well-being a priority, not merely an afterthought.\"\n\nScreen controls for parents, caregivers\n\nIn addition to the default screen time limit, Keenan said that TikTok will send every teen account a weekly recap of their screen time.\n\nTikTok is also introducing several new features to \"Family Pairing,\" which allows parents, caregivers and their children to customize safety settings.\n\nAmong the new features, caregivers will be able to set daily screen time limits for their teens – including scheduling different time limits for certain days of the week – mute notifications for certain times of the day and use a screen time dashboard to see how much their teens are using the app.\n\nExperts note that the needs of each family and individual are different.

The answer might surprise you.\n\nEnter to win a $500 Amazon Gift card.\n\nIt’s not what you think\n\nHaving your home Wi-Fi network set to private would be the most secure setting, right? That's actually incorrect. But don't let the sloppy terminology confuse you.\n\nWhen you are on your home network and have it configured as private on your computer, your PC is discoverable by other devices connected to the same network. So, in this case, the public Wi-Fi setting is more secure than the private one. Yes, you read that right!\n\nIf you want to share files or send documents to a family member in your home on the same network or your home printer, you'll need to have your network set to private.\n\nWhen the network is set to private, your printer will recognize and connect to your computer to receive the documents you want to print. Clear as mud, right?\n\nLet me summarize it again to be clear:\n\n• Private network: Use this setting only for networks you control or trust. When a network is set to private, your PC is discoverable to other devices on the network. You can use it for file and printer sharing.\n\n• Public network: Use this to connect to public networks, such as airport or hotel Wi-Fi. Your PC will be hidden from other devices on the network.\n\nDid you know your printer can be a gateway for hackers to wreak havoc? Here are five ways to lock down your printer.\n\nHow to change your network from public to private\n\nIf you need to share files, print, or otherwise make your devices discoverable to one another, set your network to private.\n\nFollow these steps on your PC and you’ll be good to go:\n\n• Right-click the Wi-Fi network icon on the far right of the taskbar.\n\n• Select Open Network & Internet Settings.\n\n• Find your Wi-Fi network and select Properties.\n\n• Select Network Profile.\n\n• Choose Private.\n\nWhen you want to boost security, go ahead and change back to the Public option. Simply follow the instructions above and when you get to the last step, select Public instead of Private.\n\nNote: This will only apply to your home network.

Responding officers eventually entered the room and a Border Patrol officer fatally shot him.\n\nThe heinous attack came just two days before students were set to be released for the summer and left a community – and nation – asking yet again: Who would do this, and why?\n\nAn examination of Ramos’ personal background reveals a bullied loner withno criminal history and – like so many other mass shooters in America– an interest in and access to high-powered firearms and ammunition in a political system that prioritizes gun rights.\n\nHe purchased guns and ammothe week before\n\nThe profile image from an Instagram account tied to the suspected Uvalde shooter, identified as Salvador Ramos. From Instagram\n\nThe suspect’s actions leading up to the shooting offer hints at his mindset and plan.\n\nRamos legally purchased two AR platform rifles at a local federal firearms licensee on May 17 and on May 20, according to state Sen. John Whitmire, who received a briefing from law enforcement Tuesday night. He also purchased 375 rounds of ammunition on May 18, Whitmire said, citing law enforcement.\n\nState Sen. Roland Gutierrez, who represents Uvalde, said the purchases were made for the suspect’s 18th birthday.\n\n“It’s the first thing he did when he turned 18,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday evening, citing a briefing he received from Texas Rangers.\n\nGutierrez said the guns were bought legally from a federally authorized dealer in the Uvalde area. “(He) had no problem accessing those weapons,” he said.\n\nA photo of two AR15-style rifles appeared on an Instagram account tied to gunman three days before the shooting. Part of the image has been obscured by CNN to remove the name of a third party. From Instagram\n\nA photo of two AR15-style rifles appeared on an Instagram account tied to the suspect just three days before the massacre. The photo was posted as a story under the username “salv8dor_.” Multiple classmates confirmed the account belonged to the suspected gunman.\n\nHe shot his grandmother and crashed vehicle before entering school\n\nThe shooting spree began Tuesday prior to Ramos arriving at Robb Elementary. Ramos first shot his grandmother at her home and then fled the scene, authorities said. The grandmother was airlifted to a hospital and was being treated in serious condition, officials said Wednesday.\n\n“The first thing that happened was the gunman shot his grandmother … She then contacted police. The gunman fled, and as he was fleeing had an accident just outside the elementary school,” Gov. Greg Abbott said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe suspect crashed his vehicle into what appears to be a flood control channel near the elementary school and emerged with a rifle and a backpack while wearing a tactical vest that holds extra ammunition, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Sgt. Erick Estrada said.\n\nA police vehicle is seen parked near a truck believed to belong to the suspect on May 24, 2022. Marco Bello/Reuters\n\nRamos moved toward the school and entered through a back door, DPS Director Steven McCraw said.\n\nThe door had just been propped open by a teacher about a minute before Ramos’ truck crashed near the school, McCraw said at a briefing Friday, citing video evidence.\n\nInitially, authorities said a school resource officer “engaged” him, but no shots were fired.\n\nOn Thursday, DPS Regional Director Victor Escalon offered a different account of what happened, saying Ramos walked into the school without any confrontation from officers.\n\nMcCraw said at a news conference Friday that when two men at a nearby funeral home heard Ramos’ truck crash, they went to see what happened. But when they saw a man with a gun get out of the truck, they ran. Ramos fired at them, but did not hit either man, McCraw said.\n\nVideo inside the school shows a teacher grab her phone and she “apparently calls 911,” McCraw said. The teacher tells dispatchers that there was a crash outside and a man with a gun.\n\nRamos then walked toward the school and began shooting at the building while officers arrived at the funeral home, McCraw said. The patrol car then sped toward the school, but drove right past the shooter, who was “hunkered down” between cars in the parking lot.\n\nAt 11:33 a.m. local time, Ramos entered the school through the propped-open door and began shooting into the first classroom. He “shot more than 100 rounds based on the audio evidence at that time,” McCraw said. In total, hundreds of shots were fired in just four minutes.\n\nThe suspect then barricaded himself in a classroom and an adjoining classroom. All of the 19 children and two teachers killed were in those rooms, DPS spokesperson Lt. Chris Olivarez said.\n\nA total of seven officers were on scene within minutes, including six Uvalde Police officers and a county deputy sheriff, according to McCraw. Two of the officers received grazing wounds from the suspect. Eventually, a total of 19 officers were on scene.\n\n“The initial group of officers that were on scene, at that point, they were at a point of disadvantage because the shooter was able to barricade himself inside that classroom. There was not sufficient manpower at that time and their main, their primary focus was preserve any further loss of life,” Olivarez said. “So they started breaking windows around the school, and trying to rescue, evacuate children and teachers while that was going on.”\n\nNearly an hour later, a specialized tactical team entered the locked classroom using keys obtained from the janitor and fatally shot the suspect, McCraw said. One officer was shot and had a non-life-threatening injury, he added.\n\nMcCraw explained the delay in entering by saying the officers on scene had switched from active shooter mode to trying to address someone who had barricaded himself in the classroom and may have been trying to entice officers to enter.\n\n“From the benefit of hindsight where I’m sitting now, of course it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision, period. There’s no excuse for that,” McCraw said.\n\nUvalde firefighter Chip King told CNN’s Jim Sciutto that it took about 30 minutes after he arrived on the scene for the gunman to be neutralized by law enforcement.\n\nThe shooter was on the premises for up to an hour before law enforcement forcibly entered a classroom and killed him, officials said Wednesday. “It’s going to be within, like 40 minutes or something, (within) an hour,” McCraw said.\n\nInvestigators found one of the suspect’s rifles, manufactured by Daniel Defense, in the school with the suspect, Whitmire said, citing the ATF. The gunman’s other rifle was left in the truck that crashed, along with 15 magazines, according to McCraw.\n\nMcCraw said 58 magazines were found at the school – 11 inside the school, three on the shooter’s body, two in Room 112, six in Room 111, five on the ground, and one was in the rifle. Thirty-two magazines were located outside the school, with most of them in a backpack he dropped outside. There were another two magazines found at his home, for a total of 60.\n\nHe had a total of 1,657 rounds of ammunition, McCraw said.\n\nRamos’ grandfather, Rolando Reyes, told CNN on Thursday that he knows many of the families whose loved ones endured the mass shooting.\n\nSome of them are my friends, and I’m going to have to face them some day,” Reyes said.\n\nReyes’ wife, the shooter’s grandmother, suffered from a bullet that pierced her jaw and upper cheek and will undergo significant reconstructive surgery. Reyes said he doesn’t understand why Ramos shot his grandmother, who took care of him.\n\nHe was a local student with few if any friends\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

He had no friends and had no criminal history or gang affiliation, he added.\n\nHe worked the day shift at a local Wendy’s and kept mostly to himself, the restaurant’s manager confirmed to CNN.\n\n“He felt like the quiet type, the one who doesn’t say much. He didn’t really socialize with the other employees,” Wendy’s evening manager Adrian Mendes said. “He just worked, got paid, and came in to get his check.”\n\nA former classmate of the gunman said Ramos “would get severely bullied and made fun of a lot” and was taunted by others for the clothes he wore and his family’s financial situation. “People would, like, actually call him school shooter and stuff like that,” he said.\n\nThe classmate, who did not want to be identified by name, said he was somewhat “close” to Ramos. They sat together through high school and played Xbox together, he said.\n\nThe suspect had stopped attending school regularly and they communicated less, aside from occasional invites to play Xbox. Recently, the suspect sent the classmate a picture of an AR-15, a backpack with rounds of ammunition and several gun magazines, he added.\n\n“I was like, ‘Bro, why do you have this?’ and he was like, ‘Don’t worry about it,’” the friend said. “He proceeded to text me, ‘I look very different now. You wouldn’t recognize me.’”\n\nStanley Torres, a senior at Uvalde High School, told CNN he shared a gym class with Ramos and described him as a “very quiet person who hung out by himself.” Another Uvalde High senior told CNN she “knew people didn’t like him. People would make fun of him or want to fight him,” but she said she wasn’t sure why.\n\nAccording to one former friend and a video obtained by CNN, the shooter had a history of physically fighting with others. The former friend and classmate said Ramos sent him the video on Snapchat more than a year ago. It depicts the shooter fighting with someone else, which the former friend said was not out of the ordinary, adding, “he would always get in fights in school.”\n\nTwo other former classmates told CNN the person in the video is Ramos.\n\nThe suspect had no known mental health history, Abbott said.\n\nHe made warnings on social media messages\n\nHours before the shooting, the gunman made a series of ominous messages on different social media sites.\n\nThe Instagram account that was linked to Ramos posted a photo of two rifles lying on a carpet and also tagged another Instagram account by name in the photo. The owner of the tagged Instagram account wrote in a story posted after the shooting that the suspect had tagged her and messaged her out of the blue.\n\nThe girl, who did not include her name on her account and has since made her account private, posted screenshots of messages that she said she exchanged with the shooter in the days before the massacre.\n\nIn one, Ramos wrote “I’m about to” – but didn’t say what he would do. “I got a lil secret,” he wrote in another message. “I wanna tell u.” She responded she might take a nap soon but would respond if she was awake.\n\nIn messages posted to her story before it went private, the girl said that she didn’t live in Texas and didn’t know Ramos.\n\n“Tthe only reason i responded to him was because i was afraid of him i wish i stayed awake to at least try to convince him to not commit his crime,” she wrote. “I didnt know.”\n\nAbbott said the gunman wrote about his intentions on Facebook. A spokesman for Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said the gunman’s private one-to-one messages were discovered after the shooting.\n\nAbbott said that in the first of three messages, about 30 minutes before the school shooting, Ramos wrote, “I’m going to shoot my grandmother.”\n\nShortly after, he wrote, “I shot my grandmother.”\n\nAnd finally: “I’m going to shoot an elementary school.”\n\nHe allegedly sent similarly chilling text messages to a girl he met online describing how he had just shot his grandmother and was going to shoot up an elementary school.\n\nThe 15-year-old girl, who lives in Frankfurt, Germany, said she began chatting with Ramos on a social media app on May 9. She said she spoke daily on FaceTime with him and also communicated with him on other apps.\n\nIn their conversations, she said he asked about her life in Germany. “He looked happy and comfortable talking to me,” the girl said. She said he told her he spent a lot of time alone at home.\n\nThere were other text messages, however, that alarmed her. In one case, she said, he told her that he “threw dead cats at people’s houses.”\n\nShe said she got the impression that he kept to himself.\n\n“Every time I talked to him,” she said, “he never had plans with his friends.”\n\nIn other group messages on Instagram from February, there was talk of Ramos being a school shooter, McCraw said. In March, there were more group chats on Instagram about Ramos buying a gun. McCraw said that last year Ramos had asked his sister to buy him a gun “but she flatly refused.”\n\nCorrection: Previous versions of this article had the wrong name for state Sen.

But a tech hearing this week threw that core assumption into question.\n\nPeiter “Mudge” Zatko, the former security chief at Twitter, told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the social network does not reliably delete the data of users who cancel their accounts, expanding on bombshell allegations he made in a whistleblower disclosure first reported by CNN and The Washington Post last month.\n\nIn his testimony and whistleblower disclosure, Zatko alleged Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data, in some cases because it has lost track of the information. Twitter has broadly defended itself against Zatko’s allegations, saying his disclosure paints a “false narrative” of the company. In response to questions from CNN, Twitter has previously said it has workflows in place to “begin a deletion process” but has not said whether it typically completes that process.\n\nPeiter Zatko, known as Mudge in the computer hacking community, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., September 13, 2022. Photo by Sarah Silbiger for CNN Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nWhile Zatko’s allegations are stunning, it also served as just another reminder to Sandra Matz of “how oftentimes mindless we are” in sharing our data online.\n\n“It sounds very simple, but whatever you put out there, don’t ever expect it to become private again,” said Matz, a social media researcher and professor at Columbia Business School. “Retracting something from the internet, hitting the reset button — is almost impossible.”\n\nThe stakes for feeling in control of our data, and confident in our ability to delete it, have arguably never been higher. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, there’s now potential to use search histories, location data, text messages and more to punish people who look online for information about or access to abortion services.\n\nIn July, Facebook-parent Meta came under harsh scrutiny after news broke that messages sent through Messenger and obtained by law enforcement had been used to charge a Nebraska teen and her mother with having an illegal abortion. (There was no indication any of the messages in that case had previously been deleted.)\n\nRavi Sen, a cybersecurity researcher and professor at Texas A&M University, said law enforcement and other groups “with resources and access to the right kind of tools and expertise” could likely recover deleted data, in certain circumstances.\n\nSen said many people don’t know all the places where their data ends up. Any post, whether it’s an email, social media comment or direct message, is typically saved on the user’s device, the recipient’s device and the servers owned by a company whose platform you used. “Ideally,” he said, “if the user who generated the content” deletes it, “the content should disappear from all three locations.” But generally, he said, “it doesn’t happen that easily.”\n\nSen said you can reach out to companies and ask them to delete your data from their servers, though many presumably never take this step. The chances of recovering a deleted message from a user’s device decreases with time, he added.\n\nThe best way to control your online data is to primarily use apps that offer end-to-end encryption, according to privacy experts. It’s also important to manage your cloud backup settings to ensure that private data from encrypted services isn’t still accessible elsewhere.\n\nBut even with all the precautions an individual can take on their end, once you put something online, Matz says, “you’ve essentially lost control.”\n\n“Because even if Twitter now deletes the post, or you delete it from Facebook, someone else might have already copied the picture that you put out there,” she said.\n\nMatz said she recommends people be more mindful about what they share on Big Tech platforms. As pessimistic as it sounds, she thinks it’s better to be overly cautious online.\n\n“Just assume that everything you put out there can be used by anyone, and will live in perpetuity,” she said.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}]}

The central bank has now held its key rate steady for three straight meetings since July.\n\nThat provides another reprieve for consumers who have faced higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans as a result of the Fed’s moves. Yet Americans, especially seniors, are finally reaping healthy bank savings yields after years of paltry returns.\n\nIn recent weeks, with inflation slowing more emphatically and the economy and job market cooling, talk has shifted from whether the Fed would hike again to how rapidly it will trim rates next year.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\n401(k) boon:Stocks surge, Dow Jones hits all-time high at close after Fed forecasts lower rates\n\nLeaving savings behind:Many Americans are missing out on high-interest savings accounts. Don't be one of them\n\nWhere's economy going?:Is a soft landing in sight? What the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates are hinting at\n\nWill the Fed raise interest rates again?\n\nThe central bank didn’t rule out another rate increase as it downgraded its economic outlook for next year while lowering its inflation forecast. In a statement after a two-day meeting, it repeated that it would assess the economy and financial developments, among other factors, to determine “the extent of any additional (rate hikes) that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2% over time.”\n\nBy adding the word “any,” however, Fed officials underscored there’s a reasonable chance it won’t have to raise rates again, though it stands ready to do so if necessary.\n\n'Not likely we will hike again'\n\n\"It's not likely we will hike again,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference, noting the Fed's key rate is \"at or near its peak.\"\n\nBut he said the economy has surprised officials with its strength recently, adding that officials \"didn't want to take the possibility of additional hikes off the table.\"\n\nWill the Fed lower rates in 2024?\n\nPerhaps more significantly, Fed officials estimate they’ll lower the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% next year, according to their median estimate. That amounts to three quarter-point cuts, more than many economists expected and the number the Fed expected in September but fewer than the full percentage point drop that markets anticipated.\n\nSometimes, the Fed reduces rates to dig the economy out of a downturn. Next year, economists believe officials will cut simply to bring borrowing costs closer to normal as inflation eases. Otherwise, inflation-adjusted rates would rise.\n\n\"It's really good to see the progress we're making\" on inflation, Powell said. \"Inflation keeps coming down, the labor market keeps coming into balance. So far, so good.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"It is far too early to declare victory and there are certainly risks.\"\n\nSome economists say the Fed is still underestimating how quickly inflation will come down next year and how sharply it will slash rates.\n\n\"We're sticking to our view that the Fed will cut faster than this,\" with 1.5 percentage points in decreases, starting in March or May, Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. \"We think inflation will fall faster than they expect.\"\n\nWhy is the 10-year Treasury yield falling?\n\nThe Fed may be reluctant to foresee too swift a rate decrease because of the market rally and recent drop in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.1%, developments that could strengthen the economy and inflation. When the Fed last met in early November, stocks were at a low point and the 10-year Treasury had reached 5% for the first time since 2007, driving up mortgage rates and corporate borrowing costs.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 1.37% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high after rising 1.4% following the Fed's signals that it's probably done lifting rates and is forecasting three cuts next year. The 10-year Treasury was down to about 4% from 4.21% on Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Powell said high Treasury yields, if persistent, likely would constrain the economy and require fewer Fed rate increases,\n\nIn its statement Wednesday, however, the central bank didn’t acknowledge the recent decline in Treasury yields, suggesting yields are still relatively high and could spike again, crimping the economy.\n\n“Tighter financial and credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and inflation,” the Fed said, repeating the language of its previous statement.\n\nIs inflation really slowing down?\n\nThe Fed’s middle-ground approach may have been cemented Tuesday by a mixed report on the consumer price index. The good news was that overall inflation barely budged in November amid falling gasoline prices, pushing down annual price gains to 3.1% from 3.2%, still well above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nBut a core measure that strips out volatile food and energy items and that the Fed watches more closely rose a sturdy 0.3% on a monthly basis, keeping the yearly rise at 4%. That underlying measure could stay elevated for several months on climbing services costs, economists say.\n\nAnd while the Fed predicted Wednesday that inflation will slow a bit more rapidly than previously thought, it also expects the economy and job market to stay more resilient despite high inflation and interest rates. That could help the U.S. avoid a recession but it also boosts the risk of a resurgence in inflation, especially if the Fed slices rates too rapidly.\n\nWill inflation get better in 2024?\n\nFed officials expect their preferred measure of annual inflation, the personal consumption expenditures index, to fall from 3% in October to 2.4% at the end of 2024, below their 2.5% projection in September.\n\nThe core measure is expected to decline from 3.5% to 2.4% by the end of next year, below the prior 2.6% estimate.\n\nWhat is the economic forecast for 2024?\n\nThe Fed expect the economy to grow at a 2.6% annual rate, above its prior 2.1% estimate. But it predicts just 1.4% growth in 2024, down slightly from its prior 1.5% projection.\n\nThe economy grew a torrid 5.2% in the third quarter but growth is projected to slow to less than 2% late this year and in 2024 as high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling COVID-related savings crimp household spending.\n\nWill the job market get better in 2024?\n\nThe historically low 3.7% unemployment rate is projected to end 2024 at 4.1%, in line with the September forecast. Average monthly job growth has downshifted from about 300,000 early this year to a still solid 200,000.\n\nAnd average yearly wage gains have tumbled to 4% from 5.9% since spring of last year. The Fed wants to lower pay increases to 3.5% to align with its 2% inflation target.\n\nBut Barclays says wage growth could decline more slowly now that a rebound in immigration may have peaked. Immigration moderates wage gains by expanding the labor supply.\n\nThat’s another potential reason for the Fed to be leery about cutting rates too quickly.\n\nWant to learn more?

The Federal Reserve System is the U.S.’s central bank.\n\nWhen does the Fed meet again?\n\nThe first Federal Reserve meeting of the new year will be from Jan. 30 through 31.\n\nFederal reserve calendar\n\nJan. 30-31\n\nMarch 19-20\n\nApril 30- May 1\n\nJune 11-12\n\nJuly 30-31\n\nSept. 17-18\n\nNov. 6-7\n\nDec. 17-18\n\nFed dot plot\n\nThe Fed’s dot plot can be found in the Fed's Summary of Economic Projections report. It’s an illustration of where individual Fed officials forecast interest rates will be years down the line. The dot plot was first created in late 2011 and was meant to give more transparency to the Fed's decisions when it came to monetary policy.\n\nThe most recent forecast for the fund rate is 5.5% to 5.75% by the end of this year, and 5% to 5.25% by the end of 2024.\n\nHow is the U.S. economy doing?\n\nThe U.S. economy was strong in the third quarter as consumers continued to spend despite high interest rates and inflation.\n\nThe value of all services and products generated in the U.S., or GDP, rose at a seasonally adjusted 4.9% for the year in the months spanning July to September, according to the Commerce Department. That was more than twice the 2.1% increase in the previous quarter and the most aggressive pace of growth since the end of 2021 when the economy surged back from a recession sparked by the pandemic.\n\nHow likely is a recession in 2024?\n\nEconomists surveyed in September said there was a 48% chance the U.S. will slip into a recession over the next year, down from the 61% odds forecast in May.\n\nBarclays predicted a loss of roughly 375,000 jobs by the middle of next year. But consumer spending remains robust despite high inflation and interest rates that are making credit card use and consumer loans more expensive. And that may help stave off a recession, says Barclays economist Jonathan Millar.\n\nWhat does FOMC stand for?\n\nThe FOMC is the Federal Open Market Committee, the voting body responsible for setting interest rates. The 12-member committee includes seven members of the Board of Governors and five of the 12 Reserve Bank presidents.\n\nWhat causes inflation?\n\nInflation can have many roots. Typically, it’s caused by \"a macroeconomic excess of spending over the economy's relative ability to produce goods and services,\" said Josh Bivens, the director of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nThat means more people are wanting items and services than there is adequate supply, leading producers to raise prices.\n\n\"If everyone in the economy, tomorrow, decided they weren't going to save any money from their paychecks, and they're just going to spend every last dollar out of the blue, they would all run to the stores and try to buy things,\" Bivens said. \"But, producers haven't produced enough to accommodate that big surge of across-the-board spending. So, you would see prices bid up.\"\n\nInflation can also happen when there are too few producers, or there aren’t enough employees to provide the coveted products and services, Bivens said.\n\nFinally, economies also have some \"built-in inflation\" to help keep inflation in check. In the U.S., that target is 2%, meaning businesses can raise prices 2% annually year and that shouldn’t overburden consumers. That’s also the typical cost of living raise offered by employers.\n\nInflation meaning\n\nInflation is the term for a \"generalized rise in prices,\" according to Josh Bivens, head of research at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington D.C.\n\nEverything from food to rent can become costlier due to inflation. But it is the overall impact that determines what the inflation rate actually is.\n\n\"Inflation, though, really is meant to only refer to all goods and services, together, rising in price by some common amount,\" Bivens said. The Federal Reserve’s inflation goal is 2%, which means businesses can hike prices by 2% a year and that shouldn’t cause consumers financial distress. Cost of living increases to workers’ pay are also expected to meet that target to ensure consumers can adequately deal with the rising costs of goods and services.\n\nWhat is CPI?\n\nIn November, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ‒ a measure of the average shift in prices for different products and services ‒ was 3.1%, down slightly from the month before.\n\nAnnual inflation is down dramatically from the 9.1% in June 2022 that marked a 40-year high but remains above the 2% target the Fed sees as the level that signals the rate of price increases is under control.\n\nWhy is CPI important?\n\nThe Federal Reserve watches two key aspects of the economy, price stability and maximum employment, and those are the main factors it takes into account for its interest rate decisions. The CPI is a primary measure the Fed looks at to help determine if prices are “stable.’’\n\nWhat is the difference between CPI and core CPI?\n\nCore prices don’t count the volatile costs of food and energy items, giving a more accurate window into longer-term trends.\n\nAre wages going up in 2024?\n\nIf you’re deemed a top performer at a company that is offering raises, you’ve got a pretty good chance of getting a pay boost next year.\n\nAbout 3 out of four business leaders told ResumeBuilder.com they intended to give raises. But half of those company executives said only 50% or less of their staff members would see a pay hike, and 82% of the raises would hinge on performance. For those who do manage to get the salary boost, 79% of employers said the pay hikes would be greater than those given in recent years.\n\nAre U.S. Treasury yields rising?\n\nNot recently.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield was above 5% in November when the Fed kept rates steady for the second consecutive month the first time it had left the key rate unchanged two months in a row in almost two years.\n\nThat led to mortgage rates spiking to almost 8% and pushed up other borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Stocks meanwhile sank close to a recent low, leading Fed Chair Jerome Powell to say such financial pressures could achieve the same cooling effect on the economy as additional rate hikes.\n\nBut in the following weeks, 10-year Treasury yields dipped to 4.2% and stocks rebounded. That might make the Fed resist rate cuts in case the economy heats up and causes the broader dip in prices “to stall at an uncomfortably elevated level,” Barclays says.\n\nBarclays and Goldman Sachs forecast that rate cuts won’t happen until the spring, and that there will be only two, to a range of 4.75% to 5%, with more cuts implemented in the next two years.\n\nWhen will inflation go back to normal?\n\nIt may take a little while.\n\nInflation’s decline likely “won’t show much progress in coming months,” Barclays wrote in a research note.\n\nOverall price hikes have eased significantly since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, a four-decade high. And in October, broader inflation as well as core prices experienced a dip, leading to a lower 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nBut core prices, which exclude the volatile costs of food and energy, will probably rise 0.3% each of the next three months, Goldman Sachs says. Used cars and furniture have been getting cheaper as the supply-chain shortages of the pandemic end. Meanwhile, health care, auto repairs, car insurance and rent continue to get more expensive, as employers pay higher wages to attract workers amid a labor shortage lingering from the global health crisis.\n\nWhat is core inflation right now?\n\nCore prices, which leave out the more volatile costs of food and energy, bumped up 0.3% in November, slightly more than the 0.2% uptick seen the previous month. That kept the yearly increase at 4%, the lowest rate since September 2021.\n\nNew inflation tax brackets\n\nInflation may also impact the amount of taxes you have to pay.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service said in its annual inflation adjustments report that there will be a 5.4% bump in income thresholds to reach each new level in next year’s tax season.\n\nIn 2024, the lowest rate of 10% will apply to individuals with taxable income up to $11,600 and joint filers up to $23,200. The top rate of 37% will apply to individuals earning over $609,350, and married couples filing jointly who make at least $731,200 a year.\n\nThe IRS makes these adjustments annually, using a formula based on the consumer price index to account for inflation and stave off \"bracket creep,\" which happens when inflation shifts taxpayers into a higher bracket though they’re not seeing any real rise in pay or purchasing power.\n\nThe 2024/25 increase is less than last year's 7% increase, but much more than recent years when inflation was below the current 3.1% inflation rate.\n\nWill Social Security get a raise because of inflation?\n\nYes, but it will be a lot less than what recipients received in 2023.\n\nThe cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to Social Security benefits will be 3.2% next year. That’s roughly one-third of the 8.7% increase given in 2023, which marked a forty-year high.\n\nThe 2024 COLA hike is above the average 2.6% raise recipients have received over the past two decades, but seniors remain concerned about being able to pay their expenses as well as the increasing possibility Social Security benefits will be reduced in coming years, according to a retirement survey of 2,258 people by The Senior Citizens League, a nonprofit seniors group.\n\nHow does raising rates lower inflation?\n\nThe federal funds rate is what banks pay each other to borrow overnight. If that rate increases, banks usually pass along that extra cost, meaning it becomes more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow as rates rise on credit cards, adjustable rate mortgages and other loans. That’s why the funds rate is the key mechanism used by the Federal Reserve to calm inflation.\n\nSimply put, companies and consumers don’t borrow as much when loans cost them more, and that means an overheated economy can cool and inflation may dip.\n\nWill credit card interest rates continue to rise this holiday season?\n\nThe Fed’s string of rate hikes, aimed at easing the highest inflation in four decades, are a big reason credit card interest rates have reached record highs just in time for the holiday season.\n\nSome retail credit cards now charge more than 33% interest, topping a 30% threshold that stores and banks were previously able to bypass but seldom did - until now.\n\n“They can charge that much,” said Chi Chi Wu, a senior attorney at the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center. “Credit cards can actually charge whatever they want. It’s a little-known fact.”\n\nThe domino effect of a high benchmark rate and soaring credit card interest could put many Americans in financial straits this holiday season.\n\nThough some consumers are paring back to deal with high prices, rising debt and shrinking savings, the average shopper expects to spend $1,652 this year on holiday purchases, according to the consultancy Deloitte, more than was typically spent in the last three years.\n\nA lot of the buying will be done with credit cards. In an October poll of 1,036 shoppers by CardRates.com, nearly 4 in 10 respondents said they intend to have holiday credit card debt in the new year.\n\nThe nation’s collective credit card debt was $1.08 trillion, at the end of September, a record high. And the average interest rate was 21%, the highest ever documented by the Federal Reserve.\n\nSavings account impact of high rates\n\nThe upside to the Fed’s string of rate hikes has been that consumers were able to earn good interest on their savings for the first time in years. Even when the Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, savers can do well.\n\nUnfortunately, most account holders aren’t making the most of that potential opportunity.\n\nRoughly one-fifth of Americans who have savings accounts don’t know how much interest they’re earning, according to a quarterly Paths to Prosperity study by Santander US, part of the global bank Santander. Among those who did know their account’s interest rate, most were earning less than 3%.\n\nBut consumers have time to make a change that could enable them to make more from their savings.\n\n\"We’re still a long way from (the Fed) beginning to cut rates,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services platform Bankrate. “This is great news for savers, who will continue to enjoy inflation-beating returns in the top-yielding, federally insured online savings accounts and certificates of deposit. For borrowers, interest rates staying higher for a longer period underscores the urgency to pay down and pay off costly credit card debt and home equity lines.\"\n\nAmid inflation, Americans seek higher credit card limits\n\nThe string of Fed rate hikes that began in March 2022 has made it costlier for consumers to borrow as interest rates on credit cards and other loans increased dramatically.\n\nAt the same time, inflation has made daily needs more expensive, pushing more Americans to lean on credit cards to get by. But lenders have become more reluctant to issue new cards, so in the midst of the holiday season, more shoppers are seeking higher credit limits, experts say.\n\nIn October, the application rate for higher limits rose to 17.8% from 11.2% in the same month the previous year, and from 12.0% in 2019, New York Fed data showed.\n\nFor some consumers, a higher limit on a card they already have is about their only option.\n\n“After COVID, inflation and interest rates went out of control ... people have less emergency funds for car repairs or buying presents,\" said Brandon Robinson, president and founder of JBR Associates, which specializes in retirement strategies. \"What they’re doing is using more credit card utilization – over 30% or well over 50% of their credit card allowance – and then can’t get approved for another card because their credit rating is down.\"\n\nInflation is leading more Americans to work multiple jobs\n\nThe number of Americans working at least two jobs is at its highest peak since before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to federal data, an uptick that may reflect the financial pressure people are feeling amid high inflation.\n\nAlmost 8.4 million people had multiple jobs in October, the Labor Department said, a figure that represents 5.2% of the laborforce, the highest percentage since January 2020.\n\n“Paying for necessities has become more of a challenge, and affording luxuries and discretionary items has become more difficult, if not impossible for some, particularly those at the lower ends of the income and wealth spectrums,” Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\nPeople may also be moonlighting to sock away cash in case they’re laid off since job cuts typically peak at the start of a new year.\n\nWhen will Fed meet?:What is the Federal Reserve's 2024 meeting schedule? Here is when the Fed will meet again.\n\nWhat is the mortgage interest rate today?\n\nMortgage rates are falling, so is it time to buy?\n\nIt depends.\n\nFirst of all, the Fed doesn’t directly set mortgage rates, but its actions have an impact. For instance, when the central bank was steadily boosting its key rate, the yield on the 10-year treasury bond went up as well. Because those bonds are a gauge for the interest applied to an average 30-year loan, mortgage rates increased.\n\nBut over the past six weeks, mortgage rates have been declining, averaging 7% for a 30-year fixed mortgage. That’s down from almost 7.8% at the end of October, according to data released by Freddie Mac on Dec. 7.\n\nThat may be giving some wannabe homeowners the confidence to start house hunting. For the week ending Dec. 1, mortgage applications rose 2.8% from the prior week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n“However, in the big picture, mortgage rates remain pretty high,” says Danielle Hale, senior economist for Realtor.com. “The typical mortgage rate according to Freddie Mac data is roughly in line with what we saw in August and early to mid-September, which were then 20 plus year highs.”\n\nSo, many potential buyers may still need to sit on the sidelines, waiting for rates to drop further, says Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac. Hale and many other experts believe mortgage rates will dip next year.\n\nInterest rate projection 2024\n\nThe Fed is expected to cut interest rates next year, though markets and economists disagree about how many rate cuts there will be.\n\nFutures markets forecast there will be four or five rate cuts in 2024, amounting to a quarter of a percentage point each. The cuts, they predict, should start by spring, and ultimately drop interest rates as low as 4% to 4.25%.\n\nBut core prices, which leave out the volatile costs of food and energy and are the metric followed more closely by the Fed, ticked up 0.3% in November, higher than the 0.2% increase the month before. That might make the Fed more hesitant to nip rates in the immediate future.\n\nGoldman Sachs and Barclays expect there to be only two rate decreases in 2024. And Fed Chair Jerome Powell has cautioned in recent public remarks that it was “premature” to talk about rate cuts.\n\nNovember inflation report\n\nInflation dipped slightly last month, with falling gas prices mitigating the impact of rising rents.\n\nConsumer prices overall increased 3.1% from a year earlier, slightly below the 3.2% rise in October, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index. That slower pace moves the inflation rate nearer to the level, reached in June, that was the lowest in over two years. Month over month, prices increased a slight 0.1%.\n\nCore prices, however, which leave out the more erratic costs of food and energy and which are more closely monitored by the Fed, increased 0.3% in November after rising 0.2% the previous month. That means core inflation’s yearly increase remained at 4%, though it’s the lowest level since September 2021.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/energy-independence-fact-check/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Despite claims of Trump-era 'energy independence,' the ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe United States never stopped importing energy from foreign countries under President Donald Trump.\n\nBoth before and after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine contributed to a spike in US gas prices, various Republicans bashed President Joe Biden for supposedly abandoning Trump-era “energy independence.” These Republicans have fostered the impression that the “energy independent” US did not need energy from Russia and elsewhere under Trump, but then, under Biden, has been forced to buy this foreign energy once more.\n\nThe truth is that the US was never close to genuine independence from foreign energy in the Trump era.\n\n“Energy independence” is a political phrase, not a literal phrase. Despite how Trump and others have made it sound, it does not mean the US was ever going it alone.\n\n“A ridiculous term,” said Jim Krane, an energy studies fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\n“A horrible term,” said Jeff Colgan, professor and director of the Climate Solutions Lab at Brown University and an expert on the geopolitics of oil.\n\n“This stupid term,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, an energy expert and a research professor at The Fletcher School at Tufts University.\n\nThe term has various non-literal definitions. And the US did satisfy some of these definitions under Trump in 2020 — as it did again in the 11 months of 2021, mostly under Biden, for which we have complete data.\n\nFor example, in both periods, the US exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported. It also produced more primary energy than it consumed.\n\nBut none of that means that the Trump-era US did no energy importing at all. From the beginning of Trump’s term to the end, the US very much relied on oil and gas from abroad.\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, the US imported about 7.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and petroleum products. That was down from prior years – the US imported more than 10 million barrels per day in 2016, President Barack Obama’s last full year – but still a whole lot of foreign energy.\n\nIn fact, contrary to prominent Republicans’ suggestions over the last month that the US had just recently started consuming Russian energy under Biden, US energy imports from Russia spiked during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd that isn’t the only thing Republicans have gotten wrong.\n\nContrary to claims from Trump and other Republicans, Biden has not “shut down” American energy: US crude oil production in Biden’s first year was higher than in each of Trump’s first two years and just narrowly shy of production in Trump’s last year, though substantially lower than production in Trump’s record-setting third year. And experts say it is economic factors and cautionary pressures from Wall Street, not anything Biden has done, that has made US oil companies reluctant to dramatically ramp up production from current levels.\n\nMultiple reasons for foreign imports\n\nAmid the US boom in oil and gas production from hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, the quantity of US imports of crude oil and petroleum products has been trending downward since early in the second term of President George W. Bush. But there are numerous reasons why the US doesn’t just stop importing entirely.\n\nOne key reason is that there is a mismatch between many of the refineries in the US, which were designed to handle heavy crude oil, and the lighter crude that is produced in the US through fracking.\n\nAnother reason is that domestic energy production isn’t sufficient to fulfill the needs of all US refineries – for which it can be profitable to buy low-cost unfinished energy from abroad, turn it into higher-value petroleum products, and then export some of those products. Colgan noted in an email that even at moments when the US is a net exporter of oil, “it remains tightly integrated into the world market for oil, constantly exporting some grades of oil to foreign customers while importing other grades of oil into the United States. Same for oil products like gasoline and diesel.”\n\nGeographic factors are also at play. For example, refineries in California have relied on imports, some from Russia, because importing has been cheaper than getting oil shipped from various parts of the US, such as the Permian Basin in the Southwest, to which California has no pipeline connection.\n\nUnless the US shifts completely to renewable or nuclear energy, Krane said in an interview, “we are going to be tethered to supply lines that stretch halfway around the world whether we like it or not.”\n\nRussian imports never ceased under Trump\n\nBefore Biden announced a ban on imports of Russian energy last Tuesday, some Republicans suggested that the US had suddenly started importing Russian oil under Biden.\n\nFor example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said at an event in late February: “We were, before Biden took office, for the first time in any of our lifetimes, actually energy independent. Putin didn’t matter. Now, they’re importing millions of barrels of oil from Russia.”\n\nIowa Sen. Joni Ernst said on Fox News on March 6 that Biden’s choices when he first came into office “put us in this tenuous position with energy independence in the United States. Instead of being an exporter of energy, we became a consumer of Russian oil.”\n\nThe truth is that the US was importing a significant quantity of oil and petroleum products from Russia under Trump: over 137 million barrels in 2018, then 189.8 million barrels in 2019 and 197.7 million barrels in 2020.\n\nImports from Russia did increase again, to 245.2 million barrels, in 2021.\n\nAnalysts have attributed part of the spike in energy imports from Russia since 2018 to the sanctions Trump imposed on Venezuelan oil in 2019, which left US refiners looking for an alternative supplier. Regardless of the cause, it’s just not true that “Putin didn’t matter” to the US energy supply before Biden took office or that the US “became a consumer of Russian oil” under Biden.\n\nWhat is true is that, under both Trump and Biden, imports from Russia made up a fraction of total US petroleum imports – about 8 percent in 2021, just about tied with Mexico for second place.\n\nThe US reliance on foreign energy is in large part a reliance on close ally Canada, which provided 51 percent of US imports in 2021.\n\nBiden’s impact has been overstated\n\nRepublicans have portrayed Biden as an all-powerful enemy of the US oil and gas industry.\n\nTrump claimed in a speech in late February that Biden “shut down American energy.” Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a Wednesday suggestion that Biden was stopping oil companies from increasing production, writing: “If Biden would let America get back to 2019 production we won’t need a single drop of oil from #Venezuela or #Iran or anyone else.”\n\nThere is no doubt that Biden’s attitude toward the US oil and gas industry is less friendly than Trump’s was. But the truth is that Biden isn’t stopping US energy companies from increasing production and certainly never “shut down” US energy production.\n\n“President Biden hasn’t done anything yet – no offense – because he can’t get anything passed through the Congress,” Jaffe said in an interview.\n\nRather, US oil companies themselves have been reluctant to dramatically ramp up production. While the oil lobby has cast blame on Biden policies, experts cite various other reasons – including supply chain problems, challenges finding workers, and, critically, the current insistence from Wall Street that energy companies restrain spending and return cash to investors.\n\n“Oil and gas companies do not want to drill more,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James, told CNN Business for an article in early March, before Biden announced the Russia ban. “They are under pressure from the financial community to pay more dividends, to do more share buybacks instead of the proverbial ‘drill baby drill,’ which is the way they would have done things 10 years ago. Corporate strategy has fundamentally changed.”\n\nKrane, the energy studies fellow from Rice University, concurred in an interview after Biden announced the ban.\n\n“It’s not a lack of leasing that’s holding back US crude. It’s Wall Street,” he said. “The federal government is like a third-tier player in the US oil market. Market signals themselves are the main driver of energy production and decision-making in the US.”\n\nEven still, US field production of crude oil in 2021, about 11.2 million barrels per day, was only slightly lower than US production under Trump in 2020, when it was about 11.3 million barrels per day – and 2021 production was higher than production in 2017 and 2018, Trump’s first two years in office, though well below the record 12.3 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\nNumerous Republicans have castigated Biden’s decision to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have carried crude oil from Canada’s oil sands to the US. But the long-delayed pipeline would almost certainly not have been ready this year even if Biden had allowed construction to proceed.\n\nThe federal Energy Information Administration projected this month that US crude oil production will hit 12 million barrels per day again in 2022, then set a new record of 13 million barrels per day in 2023.\n\nMoratorium put on hold\n\nBiden has called for a shift away from fossil fuel production and toward renewable energy sources, and he has put forward policies toward that end. Those policies have included an attempted temporary moratorium on new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands and offshore waters.\n\nBut the Biden moratorium wouldn’t have stopped drilling on existing leases. A judge put the Biden moratorium on hold in June. And the moratorium was intended to be in place only until the completion of a review by Biden’s interior department – which ended up recommending an increase to leasing fees but not a long-term halt to new leasing.\n\nAs CNN’s Ella Nilsen reported last week, the Biden administration approved more drilling permits in its first year than the Trump administration approved in 2017, 2018 and 2019, though fewer than it approved in 2020.\n\nSince late February of this year, there has been a pause on the issuance of new leases and permits on federal territory. That pause, however, was prompted by a judge’s injunction in a lawsuit filed by Republican state attorneys general.\n\nIn addition, it’s important to note that more than three-quarters of US drilling occurs on non-federal territory.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/31/live-updates-federal-reserve-interest-rate/74601234007/", "title": "Fed leaves interest rates unchanged, opens door to rate cut soon", "text": "WASHINGTON — The Fed’s long-awaited interest rate cut – a move that’s likely to juice the U.S. economy and stock market − may be just weeks away.\n\nThe Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady again Wednesday but signaled it could start lowering it as soon as mid-September amid easing inflation and a cooling job market.\n\nA report Wednesday morning provided the latest evidence that wage growth is slowing, bolstering the case for rate cuts.\n\n\"The economy is moving closer to the point where it will be appropriate to reduce our policy rate,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference. \"That time is drawing near. That time could be in September if the data support that.\"\n\nPowell added that inflation has come down notably in recent months, adding, \"It's just a question of seeing more good data.\"\n\nWhat happens when interest rates are lowered?\n\nLower rates would reduce borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards, and auto and other loans while fueling stocks. It also would trim bank saving account yields that finally have been generating healthy returns.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed provided several hints that it believes inflation is easing and officials are growing more concerned about a flagging job market.\n\nSahm rule:Are we in a recession? The Sahm rule explained\n\nIt said “inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated” and there has been “some further progress” toward the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Those are upgrades from the June statement, which simply said inflation was “elevated” and there was “modest” progress toward the 2% target.\n\nOfficials also noted the labor market has weakened, providing another reason to lower rates. “Job gains have moderated, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,” the statement said.\n\nPreviously, it simply described job gains as “strong,” and didn’t mention the rising unemployment rate.\n\nThe Fed also said the “risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the (Fed) is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.” In other words, it’s just as worried about a rising unemployment rate as it is about high inflation.\n\nIn June, the central bank was more tentative, saying its employment and inflation goals “have moved toward better balance.” And it said it remained “highly attentive to inflation risks.”\n\nAt the same time, the Fed repeated that it doesn’t expect “it will be appropriate to reduce (rates) until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward” the Fed’s 2% goal. Some economists predicted the Fed would simply say it now required “somewhat” greater confidence that inflation was heading toward 2%.\n\nStill. together, the changes reflect a Fed that seems more optimistic that a historic pandemic-induced inflation surge is softening and wants to at least open the door to an initial quarter point rate cut at a September 17-18 meeting.\n\nYet the government will release two more months of data on inflation and employment before that gathering. As a result, economist Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics said in a research note that “those looking for a clear signal (of a rate cut in Wednesday’s statement) will be disappointed.”\n\nFutures markets already were betting the Fed will trim rates three times this year, starting in September.\n\nThe Fed boosts rates to curtail borrowing and economic activity and corral inflation. It lowers rates to stimulate the economy, head off a downturn or dig the nation out of recession.\n\nWhat's the Fed's interest rate today?\n\nFrom March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed hiked its key rate from near zero to a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% to tame the largest inflation spike in 40 years. It has stood pat the past year as consumer price increases have moderated.\n\nBut the Fed is wary of sounding overly confident following recent setbacks. Annual inflation slowed substantially last year only to flare again in the first quarter. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly said officials are seeking a longer string of encouraging inflation data.\n\nIn May and June, inflation resumed its descent and some economists believe this pullback will be more enduring.\n\nPrices for services such as car insurance and health care finally have risen enough to catch up to higher wholesale costs and should be moderating, Goldman Sachs says. And rents for existing tenants – which had been soaring - are starting to reflect a longstanding decline in rent for new leases, Goldman wrote in a note to clients.\n\nPowell said the current inflation drop-off \"Is a little better than what we saw last year.\" In 2023, he said, goods prices were falling or rising more slowly and now the cost of services is also advancing increasing less sharply.\n\nWhat is the current inflation rate today?\n\nIn June, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, which excludes volatile food and energy items, was at 2.6%, down from a peak of 5.6% in 2022 and not far above the 2% goal.\n\nA flurry of other economic data also appears to be strengthening the argument for lower rates.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Labor Department said annual wage growth for private-sector workers fell to 4.1% in the second quarter from 4.3% in the prior three-month period, the smallest gain in three years. That’s good news for inflation because employers typically pass on their increased labor costs to consumers through higher prices.\n\nAlso this week, Labor said the number of people quitting jobs – typically a sign they feel confident about their chances of landing another one - tumbled to 3.3 million in June, the lowest level since 2020. That should mean pay increases will continue to soften, says economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nHow is the US job market now?\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market overall is still solid but cooling. Average monthly job growth has slowed to 177,000 the past three months from 267,000 early in the year. And during the first half of 2024, the unemployment rate jumped from 3.7% to 4.1%, historically low but the highest since November 2021. Hiring has fallen well below pre-COVID levels.\n\nAlthough the Fed has welcomed the less frothy job market, forecasters are starting to worry that policymakers may be waiting too long before chopping rates, increasing the risk of recession.\n\n\"Our view remains that the Fed is recognizing too slowly that the labor market is cooling and that high inflation isyesterday’s problem,\" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients. He expects the central bank to slash its key rate by a whopping 1.25 percentage points by year's end - the equivalent of five quarter point cuts - a more aggressive forecast than those published by most economists.\n\nPowell said officials must weigh the hazards on both sides of its mandate to achieve stable prices and maximum employment,\n\n\"We are balancing the risk of (cutting rates) too soon (and reigniting inflation) and going too late,\" nudging the economy into a downturn,\" Powell said. \"That is a very difficult judgement call.\"\n\nFed Live Conference:Hear Fed Chair Powell's remarks\n\nWant to learn more? USA TODAY explains the news on interest rates. For more answers to your questions about today's report and other economic trends, keep reading:\n\nAre rents falling in the US?\n\nRent increased 0.3% in June, the smallest monthly rise since August 2021. That nudged down the annual rent increase from 5.3% to 5.1%, a more than two-year low. Economists have expected rent increases to moderate, based on new leases, and that’s finally starting to happen more rapidly.\n\nThe cost of some other services also declined. Airfares fell 5% and hotel rates dipped 2%. The lower prices underscore “the post-COVID travel boom may be over,\" said economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics.\n\nMeanwhile, bills for medical care services and car repairs each rose a modest 0.2%. But car insurance resumed a long-standing post-pandemic surge after easing in May, leaping 0.9% and 19.5% annually.\n\nGoods prices also were generally benign. Used car prices fell 1.5%, while new cars dipped 0.2% and furniture slipped 0.9%, though appliance costs rose 0.5%. Apparel prices edged up just 0.1% following a 0.3% drop the previous month.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nAre food prices going down?\n\nGrocery prices inched up just 0.1% in June after flattening or dipping for several months. They’re up just 1.1% annually. The prices farmers received for items such as vegetables, dairy and poultry softened in April and May, leading to drops in retail prices in June, according to Barclays and the Agriculture Department.\n\nPrices fell for chicken by 0.2%; cereal, 1.3%; and rice, 0.4% in June. The cost of bacon was flat.\n\nEgg prices, though, rose 3.5%, resuming a bird-flu-related advance after dropping the prior two months. Fish costs increased 2.1%, uncooked ground beef rose 1.1% and bread edged up 0.7%.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nHow will stocks react to the Fed meeting?\n\nBecause few economists expect a rate cut this week, how the stock market reacts will be decided by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s comments after the meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIf he suggests a rate cut may be forthcoming, the stock market will likely rally, analysts said.\n\n“Equity investors want a rate cut so earnings can continue to grow at a high rate,” said Richard Ratner, investment adviser at Bel Air Investment Advisors, a money management firm.\n\nWhen interest rates are low, companies can borrow money more cheaply to invest in and grow their businesses.\n\nOn the other hand, if Powell gives “a less-than-a-full-throated support of a 25-basis-point rate cut in September, equity markets could be in for a bit of disappointment” and sell-off, said BeiChen Lin, investment strategist at Russell Investments.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow will the bond market react to the Fed?\n\nBond yields have already trended lower in anticipation of lower inflation and an imminent interest-rate cut.\n\nIf the Fed confirms those expectations on Wednesday, bond yields could reverse slightly. Ultimately, though, they could move even lower, especially if the Fed signals more than one rate cut might be coming, analysts said.\n\nDrew O’Neil, broker at Raymond James, said investors may want to move money into longer-term bonds to lock in the highest yields in at least 15 years, before they drop further.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nAre consumers still making purchases?\n\nU.S. consumers account for $7 of every $10 spent in the U.S. economy.\n\nThe median monthly increase in retail sales has been 0.3% for the past 10 years. That doesn't sound like much, until you consider a 0.1% increase in November amounted to an extra $730 million in spending.\n\nAs the primary engine of the U.S. economy, consumers bought $704.3 billion worth of stuff on a seasonally adjusted basis in June. So, yes, consumers are still making purchases.\n\n- Jim Sergent\n\nHow confident are U.S. consumers now?\n\nThe University of Michigan measures U.S. consumer sentiment on a monthly basis. The index ranged as high as 101 ahead of the pandemic in February 2020, and as low as 50 when inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022.\n\nConsumer sentiment had been rising haltingly since May 2023 but tumbled in May and remains low in July, at 66.4.\n\nJoanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, wrote in the July report that sentiment \"remains guarded as high prices continue to drag down attitudes, particularly for those with lower incomes.\"\n\n- Jim Sergent and Daniel de Visé\n\nWill credit card interest rates fall soon?\n\nEven if the Fed hints that a rate cut is coming soon, as many economists predict, don’t expect a noticeable decline in credit card interest rates, analysts said.\n\nSome banks might begin to trim their rates ahead of an official rate cut to attract new customers, but “I don’t think that is imminent,” said Matt Schulz, credit analyst at comparison site LendingTree. “And I wouldn’t expect issuers that lower their rates to do so in a big way. It’ll likely take multiple decreases over time to make meaningful change.”\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nWhen does the Fed meet again?\n\nThe remaining Fed meetings this year are:\n\nSeptember 17-18\n\nNovember 6-7\n\nDecember 17-18\n\nMany analysts anticipate a rate cut at the September meeting. In September and December, the Fed will provide updates to its economic projections. The projections are closely watched because they offer a glimpse into where Fed members see economic growth, the fed funds rate, unemployment and inflation are headed for the current year, for the subsequent three years, and for the longer run.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nHow the job market has responded to higher interest rates\n\nEven though higher interest rates are making borrowing more expensive for businesses, they have continued to add jobs, but the growth might be slowing. We'll know more on Friday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the July jobs report.\n\nThe last employment report showed an increase of 206,000 workers in June, but in the same report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised the April and May job gains down by 111,000. All three months fell well below the 10-year median job growth of 243,000.\n\n- Jim Sergent\n\nWhat is the U.S. unemployment rate?\n\nU.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.1% in June. The monthly number, which represents the percentage of people who are unemployed and looking for work, ticked up from 4% in May. A new unemployment number will be released on Friday.\n\nThe unemployment rate is rising slowly, which could suggest employers are pulling back on hiring. Still, the rate remains well below the 10-year monthly median rate of 4.2%. The job market had been on a similar roll in 2020 before the pandemic put millions out of work.\n\n- Jim Sergent\n\nIs the economy growing?\n\nThe economy picked up sharply in the second quarter, as a rise in consumer and business spending offset a drop in housing construction and a widening trade gap.\n\nThe nation’s gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.8% in the April-to-June period, the Commerce Department reported. That’s up from a tepid gain of 1.4% early this year and a 2.5% increase for all of 2023.\n\nThe economy has been surprisingly resilient, despite high interest rates and inflation in the past two years, as a result of strong job and wage gains that have provided consumers the wherewithal to keep spending.\n\nBut cracks are beginning to show, as high borrowing costs take a bigger toll on households and companies.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nIs US consumer spending increasing or decreasing?\n\nIn the second quarter, consumer spending increased a solid 2.3% annualized, above the 1.5% pace of early this year but below the more-than-3% clip in the second half of 2023.\n\nTo fuel their purchases, Americans are spending more of their paychecks, saving about 3.8% of their monthly income, well below the average saving rate before the pandemic. As a result, they don’t have much cushion. Low and middle-income households have largely depleted their pandemic-era reserves. Credit card debt is near a record high, and delinquencies are historically elevated.\n\nMore broadly, the economy is forecast to grow less than 2% annualized the second half of the year, according to a survey by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators.\n\n\"We should receive cooler GDP reports from here on out, as consumers tighten their purse strings and businesses become more reticent to invest and hire,\" said Nationwide economist Oren Klachkin.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nWhen will mortgage rates fall?\n\nThe Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but its actions can influence them, along with the bond market and inflation and the broader U.S. economy.\n\nEven though the Fed hasn’t lowered interest rates in four years, inflation is easing, and bond investors anticipate a rate cut soon. That expectation has already helped push bond yields and mortgage rates lower. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is 7.24%, as of Wednesday, down from a peak above 8% last fall.\n\nIf inflation stays contained and the Fed actually begins a rate-cutting cycle, mortgages rates may head even lower, said Jacob Channel, LendingTree’s senior economist. “We might see rates trending back to their 2024 lows over the coming weeks and months,” he said. “If all goes really well, we could even end the year with the average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage closer to 6% than 6.5% or 7%.”\n\n- Medora Lee and Daniel de Visé\n\nIs inflation slowing yet?\n\nAfter reaching a 40-year high of 9.1% in mid-2022, inflation eased substantially last year before unexpectedly surging again in the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn April, price gains gradually resumed a pullback. The price of goods such as used cars, furniture and appliances generally have drifted lower as pandemic-related supply-chain snarls have faded.\n\nBut the costs of services such as rent, car insurance and health care have continued to advance. That’s partly because employee wage growth was propelled by COVID-19-induced labor shortages and is slowing only gradually. Many employers have passed their higher labor costs on to consumers.\n\nBarclays expects that, by December, yearly inflation will slow to 3% – still well above the Fed’s 2% inflationary goal.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nWhat will the Fed say today?\n\nEconomic forecasters don't expect the Fed to cut interest rates today. Instead, they predict the panel will comment on positive economic news and hint at the timing of future cuts, perhaps as early as September.\n\nThe Fed is likely to express “’greater confidence' that inflation is sustainably moving toward 2%,” the Fed's target for inflation, wrote Parthenon EY's chief economist Gregory Daco in a note.\n\nBut inflation won’t be the only thing on the Fed’s mind, analysts said.\n\n“It is noteworthy that Powell has begun to emphasize the downside risks to the economy and the labor market if the Fed were to wait too long, or be too cautious, in reducing interest rates,” said Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at research firm Oxford Economics.\n\nAlthough recent economic data show resiliency, “consumer fundamentals may not be quite as solid as they once appeared,” said Michael Feroli, JP Morgan’s chief U.S. economist, in a report.\n\nCoupled with easing inflation, the Fed’s two goals — maximum employment and stable prices — are coming back into balance, which economists expect the Fed to acknowledge.\n\nBut they predict the Fed will also say it needs to see more data to be sure.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nThe Daily Money newsletter equips you with the knowledge to spend and save smart. Sign up today.\n\nWhen is the last time the Fed cut interest rates?\n\nIt seems a lifetime ago, but the last time the Federal Reserve cut interest rates was in March 2020, at the dawn of the pandemic.\n\nThe Fed unleashed much of its arsenal that month to combat the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus, cutting short-term interest rates to zero, pumping cash into the financial system and encouraging more bank loans to households and businesses.\n\nThe moves, cheered by then-President Donald Trump, were aimed at combating a recession, which forecasters considered likely.\n\n\"The virus presents significant economic challenges,\" Powell told reporters on a teleconference at the time.\n\nThat month, central bank policymakers agreed to lower the Fed’s benchmark federal funds rate by a full percentage point, to a range of zero to 0.25%. And that would be the last pandemic-era rate cut.\n\n- Paul Davidson and Daniel de Visé\n\nWhy can’t the Fed give a clear timeline for rate cuts?\n\nThe Fed can't commit to cutting interest rates until several economic factors align, analysts say. Inflation is but one.\n\nEasing inflation is a “requirement - but not sufficient on its own - for a September interest rate cut,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at Dutch bank ING.\n\nThe Fed also must see more evidence the labor market and consumer spending are softening, he said.\n\n“We’ve seen many times this cycle that the pace of disinflation is non-linear,” said BeiChen Lin, investment strategist at Russell Investments. “Given that the labor market and economic activity in the U.S. are still relatively robust for now, I think Powell may give only muted hints about the policy action in September.”\n\nThe unemployment rate in June inched up to 4.1%, the highest since November 2021, mostly because more people are looking for jobs, not losing jobs, Knightley said.\n\nMeanwhile, consumer spending remains resilient, growing a solid 2.3% annualized from April through June, above the 1.5% pace of earlier this year, but just below the more-than-3% clip in the second half of 2023.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nWhat is the fed funds interest rate today?\n\nThe benchmark short-term federal funds target rate stands at a 23-year high, expressed as a range from 5.25% to 5.5%. That means Americans have been paying higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. But consumers have also benefitted from more generous bank savings yields, after years of meager returns.\n\nSince March 2022, the central bank has hiked the fed funds rate 11 times, from near zero, to corral a spike in pandemic-induced inflation. But the panel has left the rate unchanged since July 2023.\n\nForecasters don't expect the Fed to act on interest rates today.\n\n- Medora Lee\n\nS & P 500 jumps ahead of interest rate announcement\n\nStocks were up Wednesday morning, ahead of the Fed decision on interest rates, largely on the strength of renewed market enthusiasm over the tech industry.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 0.1% shortly after the start of trading. The S&P 500 was up 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 2.1%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, the semiconductor company, was leading a tech stock rally, following a promising earnings report and high hopes for growth in the AI chip market. AI powerhouse Nvidia soared more than 10% on the same news.\n\n- Daniel de Visé\n\nJapan interest rates raised to unseen levels\n\nEven as American markets brace for interest rate cuts this fall, the Bank of Japan raised interest rates Wednesday to levels unseen in 15 years.\n\nJapan's shift to tighter monetary policy contrasts sharply with the broad swing to lower interest rates by other major economies, with the Fed expected to signal that it will cut rates in September as U.S. price pressures moderate.\n\nThe Japanese rate hike, which dashed dominant market expectations for no change, was the largest since 2007 and came just months after the BOJ ended eight years of negative interest rates as the bank's chief seeks to dismantle his predecessor's unorthodox policies.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy. The hawkish comments pushed the dollar below 151 yen for the first time since March, as markets awoke to the reality that Japan was finally eyeing a full-fledged rate hike cycle.\n\n- Reuters\n\nCurrent inflation rate 2024\n\nInflation eased more than expected in June, as falling gasoline prices offset another increase in rent, providing a third straight month of relief for Americans struggling with a pandemic-related spike in prices.\n\nThe development, combined with a recently cooling job market, should bolster the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in the next couple of months − a move that likely would juice the economy and U.S. stocks.\n\nOverall prices rose 3% in June from a year earlier, a third-straight monthly pullback, according to the Labor Department’s consumer price index, a broad gauge of goods and services costs. That’s the smallest rise in a year. On a monthly basis, costs edged down 0.1% after flatlining in the previous month.\n\nThe price of used cars and airfares dropped, while grocery and health care costs rose modestly.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nAre interest rates going down?\n\nThis week’s Federal Reserve meeting probably won’t yield an interest rate cut, but it will likely lay the groundwork for one in September, most economists predict.\n\nThe Fed’s benchmark, short-term rate has stood at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, as the Fed waits for inflation to cool further. Annual inflation dipped in June to 3.0%: far below the two-decade high of 9.1% in June 2022, but still above the Fed’s 2% goal.\n\nMost economists expect only hints of future Fed actions from the panel today, when its two-day policy meeting ends. They believe that inflation is trending in the right direction, and that two more months of cooler inflation reports will give the Fed room to ease rates.\n\nInterest rate cuts on the horizon?Will the Fed cut rates this week? Key economic news guiding in their decision\n\nBut “the hint will be subtle,” wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at research firm Oxford Economics, in a note. “Those looking for a clear signal will be disappointed.”\n\nInterest rates are the main tool the Fed uses to lower inflation. High rates make borrowing more expensive, which slows spending and the economy, generally easing price hikes.\n\n- Medora Lee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump: Key takeaways from six years of former president's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/politics/fact-check-biden-deficit-reduction/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Deconstructing Biden's claim that 'I reduced the federal ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been taking credit for reducing the federal budget deficit, the annual gap between the money the government takes in and the money the government spends.\n\n“Let me remind you again: I reduced the federal deficit,” Biden said in a speech on Wednesday. “All the talk about the deficit from my Republican friends, I love it. I’ve reduced it $350 billion in my first year in office. And we’re on track to reduce it, by the end of September, by another 1 trillion, 500 billion dollars – the largest drop ever.”\n\nBiden’s figures for both the 2021 fiscal year (which ran through last September) and the ongoing 2022 fiscal year (which runs through the coming September) are accurate, though the $1.5 trillion figure for 2022 is a projection. But some experts on fiscal policy say Biden is distorting reality when he claims that he is personally responsible for the deficit going down.\n\nThe deficit has been smaller under the Biden administration than it was at the end of President Donald Trump’s tenure. But the deficit has been bigger under the Biden administration than the nonpartisan federal Congressional Budget Office had projected it would be if the Biden-era federal government stuck with the laws that were in effect when Trump left office in early 2021.\n\n“The actions of the administration and Congress have undoubtedly resulted in higher deficits, not smaller ones,” Dan White, senior director at Moody’s Analytics – an economic research firm whose analysis Biden has repeatedly touted in his speeches – said in an email. “It is encouraging that the administration has proposed some initiatives to bring down the deficit, but so far none of those initiatives has been seriously considered.”\n\nA smaller deficit than before – but a bigger deficit than expected\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021, during which Biden was in office for more than eight months, was about $360 billion lower than the roughly $3.1 trillion deficit in fiscal 2020, Trump’s last full fiscal year in office.\n\nA $360 billion decline is certainly substantial. The Congressional Budget Office, however, had estimated at the beginning of Biden’s tenure that the fiscal 2021 deficit would be a decline of more than $870 billion if the Biden administration did not implement new policy.\n\nThe Biden administration did implement new policy – notably including a massive pandemic relief package.\n\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization that advocates deficit reduction, said in an interview that Biden’s claims about having personally reduced the deficit are “almost bizarro world,” a reversal of reality. The deficit would have fallen by much more “had President Biden come to office and not done anything,” he said.\n\nIt’s important to note that Congress has the power of the purse in the federal government. Presidents propose budgets, but Congress habitually ignores them in favor of its own spending preferences. So both blame and credit should be shared.\n\nGoldwein said the Biden administration has “a lot of good ideas” for reducing the deficit in the future. But so far, he said, Biden has “done lots of things that have increased deficits” – from signing the pandemic relief package to signing a major bipartisan infrastructure law to boosting food stamp benefits to extending the Trump-era pandemic pause on federal student loan repayments – and has “passed no pieces of legislation to directly reduce deficits.”\n\nExpiring pandemic spending has been the main factor\n\nSo why, then, has the federal deficit gotten smaller at all under Biden, even if it has been higher than was originally projected at the time Biden took office?\n\nThere are a number of factors at play – including the economic rebound for which White, Goldwein and others say Biden can fairly take some credit. But the main factor is that temporary pandemic relief spending has been ending, bringing federal spending down from extraordinarily high levels.\n\nThere was an explosion of short-term spending under Trump after the pandemic hit in 2020. Combined with the reduction in tax revenue largelycaused by the pandemic-related economic crash, that temporary spending caused the deficit to skyrocket to an all-time record in fiscal 2020 – the roughly $3.1 trillion that was more than triple the deficit of the year prior.\n\nSo a decline from unprecedented 2020 deficit levels was always very likely.And even a big decline from those 2020 levels doesn’t mean the deficit is low by historical standards.\n\nThe roughly $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal 2021 is the second-largest deficit in US history in nominal terms and, according to Goldwein’s organization, the sixth-largest as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product. If the fiscal 2022 deficit does end up $1.5 trillion lower than the fiscal 2021 deficit, as Biden correctly noted the Treasury Department now expects, it would still be among the largest ever.\n\nAnd even with a $1.5 trillion decline from fiscal 2021, the fiscal 2022 deficit is still expected to be significantly higher than the deficit the Congressional Budget Office had projected for fiscal 2022 at the time Biden took office. Running a higher-than-expected deficit in fiscal 2021 provided more room for dramatic-sounding deficit reduction in fiscal 2022.\n\nThe quick rebound has helped, too\n\nThe deficit has a spending component and a revenue component. And it would be fair for Biden to boast about putting more revenue in government coffers through economic growth.\n\nBiden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief bill not only increased government spending but helped fuel an unusually rapid recovery from the 2020 crash – a recovery that generated additional tax payments as well as reducing spending on unemployment benefits in particular.\n\nJoel Friedman, senior vice president for federal fiscal policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank, said in an email that the deficit has fallen under Biden in part because pandemic measures have expired but also “because of strong economic growth” Friedman said is “related” to the pandemic measures.\n\nThe “robust” federal pandemic response not only reduced hardship, Friedman said, but “helped make the Covid-19 recession the shortest on record and helped fuel an economic recovery that has brought the unemployment rate down to 3.6 percent and boosted revenue.”\n\nThe deficit did increase under Trump\n\nWhile claiming credit for the deficit falling during his own presidency, Biden has also taken aim at Republicans’ fiscal stewardship – saying in his Wednesday speech that the deficit “went up every year under my predecessor, before the pandemic and during the pandemic.”\n\nThat part is true. Trump’s tax cuts and other policies led to a sharp increase in the deficit even before Covid-19.\n\nThe deficit was $439 billion under President Barack Obama in fiscal 2015 and $587 billion in fiscal 2016, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office. It rose to $666 billion in fiscal 2017, Trump’s first partial fiscal year in office; rose again to $779 billion in fiscal 2018; then rose once more to $984 billion in fiscal 2019 before the pandemic-related tripling in fiscal 2020.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/31/january-federal-reserve-meeting-live-updates/72409059007/", "title": "Fed decision: Interest rates unchanged, March cut unlikely", "text": "WASHINGTON – The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady Wednesday and opened the door to rate cuts but signaled that a March move is probably a long shot despite rapidly slowing inflation.\n\nIn a statement after a two-day meeting, the Fed removed its previous reference to “additional (rate increases).”\n\nInstead, the Fed said it believes the risks to its goals of stable inflation and full employment \"are moving into better balance.”\n\nWill Fed rate cuts lift Americans?Fed interest-rate cuts are likely coming but may not offer much relief\n\nThe language affirms that the central bank is almost certainly done raising interest rates after 16 months of aggressive hikes to tame high inflation and a rate cut is now far more likely than an increase.\n\nCapitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates\n\nBut the Fed also suggested it’s in no rush to reduce rates and wants to make sure inflation has been subdued for the long term before acting.\n\n“In considering any adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the (Fed) will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,” the central bank said.\n\nIt pointedly added, “The (Fed) does not expect it will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.”\n\nAt a news conference, Federal Chair Jerome Powell said the language was intended to convey that a March rate cut hasn't been ruled out but is unlikely.\n\n\"The timing of (the first rate decrease) is linked to our gaining confidence that inflation is on a sustainable path down to 2%,\" Powell said. \"I don't think it is likely (Fed officials) will reach that level of confidence by the time of the March meeting. It's probably not the most likely case.\"\n\nPowell said officials are pleased that inflation has come down so swiftly over the past six months and aren't worried that the Fed's preferred inflation measure, now at 2.6%, will flare higher. But they want to see a longer string of data that shows inflation is continuing to ease and won't stabilize at the current level.\n\n\"It's a highly consequential decision to start the process of dialing back (economic) restraint,\" Powell said. \"We want to get that right.\"\n\nKathy Bostjancic, chief economist of Nationwide, expects the first rate decrease in May.\n\n\"Inflation will be the key reason for them to reduce the fed funds target range, but we also expect slower employment and a mild recession unfolding mid-year,\" Bostjancic, who is among a minority of economists still forecasting a downturn in 2024.\n\nThe Fed on Wednesday broadly upgraded its economic outlook after a strong fourth quarter, noting that activity “has been expanding at a solid pace.”\n\nWhat is the key interest rate?\n\nWednesday’s decision leaves the Fed’s benchmark short-term rate at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% following a flurry of aggressive hikes aimed at taming the nation’s sharpest inflation spike in four decades. The central bank has left the federal funds rate unchanged since July as consumer price increases have slowed more dramatically.\n\nBy standing pat for a fourth straight meeting Wednesday, the Fed provides another reprieve to consumers who still face higher borrowing costs for credit cards, adjustable-rate mortgages and other loans since officials launched their inflation fight in early 2022. Yet many Americans, especially seniors, are being helped by healthy bank savings yields after years of meager returns.\n\nAre rate cuts coming?\n\nThere’s little doubt that a slide in rates is on the way. In December, the Fed forecast three quarter-point cuts this year, more than anticipated, further stoking an S&P 500 stock index that was already vaulting toward a new record on the pullback of inflation and the prospect of lower rates. Futures markets now foresee as many as six rate cuts.\n\nBut exactly when the Fed will begin to reverse the historic run-up in borrowing costs and how swiftly it will do so is a thornier question.\n\nPolicymakers have been wrestling with how to respond to the unusual tandem of tumbling inflation and a solidly growing economy. Normally, easing price increases are triggered by substantially slowing consumer demand and economic growth.\n\nThis time is different. Pandemic-related product and labor shortages sparked the inflation spike and their resolution has allowed price gains to stabilize, economists say.\n\nWhat is the inflation rate right now?\n\nIn December, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure – the personal consumption expenditures index – rose 2.6% annually, down from a high of 7% in summer 2022. A core measure that excludes volatile food and energy items and that the Fed watches more closely dipped to 2.9%, the lowest since March 2021 but still above officials’ 2% goal.\n\nAnd yearly wage growth, which feeds into inflation, fell to 4.3% in the last three months of 2023 from 4.5% the prior quarter, according to a key gauge of pay increases released Wednesday.\n\nIs the US economy strong right now?\n\nMeanwhile, though, the economy grew at a sturdy 3.3% annual rate in the fourth quarter and a healthy 2.5% for all of 2023. Americans have opened their wallets, shrugging off still elevated prices and borrowing costs, largely as a result of hefty pay increases. And while employment growth has been gradually slowing, the economy added a robust 216,000 jobs in December.\n\nMany forecasters believe growth will slow to just under 2% this year as households feel the strains of high interest rates, record credit card debt and dwindling pandemic-related savings. That would still be a respectable showing, but some experts continue to predict a mild recession.\n\nA few months ago, Powell said officials were concerned that a persistently strong economy and job market could lead the Fed to raise rates or keep them high on the risk they could push inflation higher even if price gains were currently moderating. But Powell said officials now believe that in the post-pandemic environment, a strong economy and falling inflation can co-exist. A healing supply chain and a recovering labor supply have allowed price increases to moderate even as the economy has stayed resilient, he said.\n\n\"We don't see that as a problem,\" he said.\n\nThe favorable economy also means the Fed can afford to be patient as it weighs rate cuts, some officials say. In a recent speech, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank should move “methodically and carefully,” adding, “With economic activity and labor markets in good shape and inflation coming down gradually to 2%, I see no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.”\n\nCould inflation go back up?\n\nBarclays is among economic research firms that also note it’s too soon to proclaim victory over inflation. Wage growth has moderated as a rebound in immigration has expanded the pool of available workers. But there are signs the increase in the labor supply has peaked, meaning the upward pressure on wages could resume. And while the gauge released Wednesday showed easing pay increases, another measure of hourly pay gains ticked up in December.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s a risk that the supply chain snarls that triggered inflation in the early days of the pandemic could flare again because of military conflict in the Red Sea, Barclays says.\n\nYet there may also be risks to moving too slowly. The inflation drop-off means interest rates after adjusting for inflation are more restrictive than the Fed would like, potentially hampering the economy more than is needed to bring price gains under control.\n\nAnd there are signs the labor market is wobbling, says Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle.\n\nJust a handful of industries have added jobs recently, including government, health care and restaurants, and hotels. Some of those sectors aren’t as sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy and interest rates.

Demographers say it's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk tweeted, not for the first time, that “population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming.” Climate change is a serious problem facing the planet and experts say it’s difficult to compare problems.\n\nWhat is clear, demographers say, is that the global population is growing, despite declines in some parts of the world, and it shouldn’t be collapsing any time soon – even with birth rates at lower levels than in the past.\n\n“He’s better off making cars and engineering than at predicting the trajectory of the population,” said Joseph Chamie, a consulting demographer and a former director of the United Nations Population Division, who has written several books about population issues.\n\n“Yes, some countries, their population is declining, but for the world, that’s just not the case.”\n\nPopulation projections by the numbers\n\nThe world’s population is projected to reach 8 billion by mid-November of this year, according to the United Nations. The UN predicts the global population could grow to around 8.5 billion in just 8 years.\n\nBy 2080, the world’s population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion. Then there’s a 50% chance that the population will plateau or begin to decrease by 2100. More conservative models like the one published in 2020 in the Lancet anticipate the global population would be about 8.8 billion people by 2100.\n\nIt’s true that what’s driving current population growth is not a higher birth rate. What drives global population growth is that fewer people are dying young. Global life expectancy was 72.8 years in 2019, an increase of nine years since 1990. That is expected to increase to 77.2 years by 2050.\n\nGlobally, the fertility rate has not “collapsed,” nor should it, according to the UN, but it has dropped significantly.\n\nIn 1950, women typically had five births each; globally, last year, it was 2.3 births. By 2050, the UN projects a further global decline to 2.1 births per woman.\n\nIn some countries, it is lower. In the US the 1950s, it was 3.6 births per woman, it slipped to 1.6 in 2020, according to the World Bank. In Italy, it was 1.2; in Japan, it was 1.3; in China, 1.2. In January 2022, the country announced the birth rate fell for the fifth year in a row, even with the repeal of the one child policy, allowing couples to have up to three children as of 2021.\n\n“Virtually every developed country is below two, and it’s been that way for 20 or 30 years,” Chamie said. Most countries have gone through what’s called a demographic transition.\n\nThe only continent that hasn’t finished this transition, he said, is parts of Africa, where there are 15 to 20 countries where the average number of children couples have is five. But in those countries, children still face high death rates. The infant mortality rate for kids under 5 is 8 to 10 times higher than in developed regions, and maternal mortality is more than double, Chamie said.\n\nIf women in these African regions had more access to contraception, education, and health care, these problems could be addressed and the global population could decline further – but people would be better off in terms of individual health.\n\nThe ‘gold medal’ century\n\nIn terms of population growth, the 20th century was an anomaly.\n\n“That century was the most impressive demographic century ever. It had more gold medals than all the other centuries,” Charmie said.\n\nThe human population nearly quadrupled, something that had never happened before in recorded history. That’s largely because of improvements in public health.\n\nThe world has antibiotics, vaccines, public health programs and improved sanitation to thank for people living longer and more mothers and children surviving birth.\n\nWith contraception, especially in 1964, when the oral pill was widely introduced in the US, couples were now better able to determine when and how many children they had.\n\n“Contraception, the oral pill had a much more significant effect on the world than the car,” Charmie said.\n\nAs more women got an education, worked outside the home and got a later start on children in many countries with access to contraception, couples had fewer children and the population started to decline.\n\nIn 2020, the global population growth rate fell under 1% for the first time since 1950.\n\nThe picture in the US\n\nIn the US, the fertility rate is down in part due to what Ken Johnson, a senior demographer at the Casey School of Public Poilcy and a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, characterized as a “significant” decline in teen births.\n\n“Most demographers would see that as a good thing,” he said.\n\nHe said the other driver was a decline in the number of births to women in their 20s. That trend has been around since 2008. People put off or decided not to have babies in part because of the recession, he said. Covid then exacerbated this trend.\n\nBetween July of 2020 and 2021, the growth rate of the US population was the lowest it’s been in probably 100 years he said.\n\n“Is it a collapse of the number of births? No, I wouldn’t say that,” Johnson said.\n\nHe said there are a few factors at play in the low US growth rate: fewer births, fewer immigrants due to Trump-era policies, and more deaths as the US population is ages. Covid-19 contributed to higher deaths, too.\n\n“It’s almost like a perfect storm if you will,” Johnson said. “Births are way down, Covid pushes deaths way up, and then immigration is quite slow, too, so it is no wonder that the population growth rate is so low when you bring all those factors together at the same time.”\n\nPreventing population problems down the road\n\nAs the population ages and birth rates decline in some areas of the globe, that could put strain on social systems.\n\nThe share of the population over age 65 will rise from 10% in 2022 to 16% in 2050. That’s twice the number of kids under age 5.\n\nGlobally, the trick to make such a population age imbalance work, is that governments will need to be proactive, the UN says. Countries with aging populations need to adapt public programs that will support this growing population of older people. That means shoring up programs like social security, pensions and establishing universal access to health care and long-term care.\n\nIn the US, William Frey, a demographer and senior fellow with Brookings Metro, said he doesn’t see the need for more couples to have more babies to address the age imbalance in the United States. Policies that would support couples that want children – affordable daycare and family leave policies, for example – could help, but that that hasn’t made a big difference in terms of fertility rates.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nFertility is below the replacement rate in the US, meaning couples are having fewer than two children each, but the rate is not as low as it is in most of Europe, he said.\n\n“I don’t think in the US it’s an issue of collapse, because we can certainly open the faucet for more immigrants anytime we want to,” Frey said. “We’ll have no paucity of people who want to come through the door to immigrate here in the future. Immigrants and their children are younger than the population as a whole and so that will help to keep the population from aging as well.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/08/21/dnc-fact-check-tim-walz/74831613007/", "title": "DNC fact check: What Walz, other speakers got right and wrong", "text": "Tim Walz, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee, took the stage Wednesday on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and we followed along to let you know if he, former President Bill Clinton and other speakers strayed from the truth.\n\nWalz, 60, is a former teacher elected to be Minnesota’s governor in 2019 after serving multiple terms in the U.S. House of Representatives.

It supported Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, Republican George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004, Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Republican Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThe congressional seat has also gone both ways. Prior to Gutknecht’s tenure, Democrat Timothy Penny served as its representative for more than a decade from 1983 to 1995.

This is personal for Gwen and I.”\n\nThis is not the first time Walz has discussed his and his wife’s battle with infertility, which he discussed at length in tonight's speech.\n\n\"If you've never experienced the hell that is infertility I guarantee you you know somebody who has,\" Walz went on to say. \"And I can remember praying each night for a phone call. The pit in your stomach when the phone had rang, and the absolute agony when we heard the treatments hadn't worked it. It took Gwen and I years, but we had access to fertility treatments.\"\n\nThough Walz often links their struggles to the subject of in vitro fertilization treatments, or IVF, Walz’s wife told Glamour this month that the couple actually used a process called intrauterine insemination, or IUI. She described her neighbor, a nurse, coming over to administer the shots she needed for the treatment. The couple was married in 1994 and had their daughter, Hope, in 2001.\n\nWhile IVF involves artificially inseminating mature eggs collected from ovaries in a lab, IUI involves the insertion of sperm directly into the uterus.\n\nWhen asked about Walz’s use of the term IVF, Harris campaign spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg told PolitiFact Walz “was using commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.\"\n\n-Hannah Hudnall, Eric Litke\n\nTim Walz claim: He protected reproductive freedom as governor\n\n“Then I came back to serve as governor and we got right to work, making a difference in our neighbor’s lives ... we also protected reproductive freedom.”\n\nWalz signed a bill enshrining the right to abortion and other reproductive healthcare into Minnesota state statues in January 2023, seven months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“Every individual who becomes pregnant has a fundamental right to continue the pregnancy and give birth, or obtain an abortion, and to make autonomous decisions about how to exercise this fundamental right,” the law says.\n\nThe White House recognized Minnesota as the first state to codify abortion rights in 2023.\n\nMonths later, Walz signed a bill that protected people traveling to Minnesota for abortion care, as well as the professionals providing that care, from legal repercussions from other states.\n\n-BrieAnna Frank\n\nTim Walz claim: He cut the cost of prescription drugs in Minnesota\n\n“We cut the cost of prescription drugs.”\n\nIn 2020, Walz signed the Alec Smith Insulin Affordability Act into law, allowing eligible individuals to receive one emergency 30-day supply of insulin for $35 and capping 90-day supplies at $50. The act was named for a man who died while attempting to ration his insulin due to a monthly cost of $1,300.\n\nWalz also passed the Minnesota Prescription Drug Price Transparency Act the same year, providing consumers with information about drug prices in Minnesota through a quarterly list of “drugs of substantial public interest.” The list, intended to decrease cost by increasing awareness, focused on groups of medications where the amounts paid where well above manufacturer list prices.\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nPete Buttigieg claim: Crime was higher under the Trump administration than it is now\n\n“As if we were going to forget that crime was higher on his watch.”\n\nThe truth of this claim depends on what years you look at and which crimes you count.\n\nThe FBI’s Crime Data Explorer shows the rate of violent crime (murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault) in the U.S. dropped from 395 per 100,000 in 2017 (Trump’s first year in office) to 381 in 2019 before rising to 398 in 2020 (Trump’s final year in office). The data is incomplete for Biden’s presidency but shows the rate dropped to 387 in 2021 and 381 in 2022.\n\nThe FBI has not yet released the final 2023 violent crime figures, which come out each October. Crime data expert and former CIA analyst Jeff Asher told PolitiFact the preliminary estimates for 2023 show a violent crime rate that would be the lowest in 50 years.\n\nIn other words, the latest data shows the best crime figures under Biden are expected to be lower than the best under Trump.\n\nThe murder rate under Trump rose from 6.2 per 100,000 in 2017 to 7.8 in 2020, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The data is incomplete for Biden's term, but it first rose to 8.2 in 2021, then dropped to 7.7 in 2022. So it was lower than Trump’s last year, but still well above earlier in Trump’s term.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nAmy Klobuchar claim: Walz delivered biggest tax cut in Minnesota history\n\n“Tim has delivered ... the biggest tax cut in Minnesota history.”\n\nWalz signed the One Minnesota Budget into law in May 2023. The package included a tax bill that, among other things, provided a one-time refundable tax credit, a child tax credit of up to $1,750 per child for lower-income families and exempted most seniors from paying state taxes on Social Security income.\n\nThe tax cuts were the largest in state history, the Star Tribune reported. The package also, however, created the largest tax hike in state history that sought to raise $1 billion over two years from corporations and wealthy residents, according to the outlet.\n\nWalz’s office also said the bill provided the largest tax cut in state history.\n\n-BrieAnna Frank\n\nBill Clinton claim: Democratic presidents have created 50 million new jobs since 1989 compared to only 1 million for Republican presidents\n\n“Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, America has created about 51 million new jobs. What's the score? Democrats 50, Republicans 1.”\n\nThis is correct. Since 1989, more than 51 million jobs have been created in the U.S., according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. That data, examining total non-farm workers, shows about 50 million of those jobs were created under the presidencies of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, compared to about 1 million created under the presidencies of George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump.\n\nThose numbers vary slightly depending on whether you give the incoming or outgoing president credit for January figures as the new president is sworn in, and which dataset is used. Jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is similar, showing a split of roughly 49 million to 2 million.\n\nBut the numbers don’t tell the whole story. Economists say a variety of factors outside the control of any president play into job creation or loss.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\n“Month-to-month job creation is just a function of the dynamic U.S. economy that’s bigger than one person,” Chris Douglas, an associate professor of economics at the University of Michigan-Flint, told public media outlet Marketplace.\n\nRepublican job creation figures are skewed by events such as the Great Recession, which began under George W. Bush in 2007 and cost Americans more than 8 million jobs, and the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that began under Trump in 2020.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nJared Polis claim: Project 2025 says states have to report miscarriages to federal government\n\n“On page 455, Project 2025 says that states have to report miscarriages to the Trump administration.”\n\nThe Colorado governor is referencing a section of Project 2025 with recommendations for the Department of Health and Human Services relating to abortion that also mention miscarriages. It appears to be calling for states to regularly report cumulative totals, not specific instances.\n\n“Because liberal states have now become sanctuaries for abortion tourism, HHS should use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders, at what gestational age of the child, for what reason, the mother’s state of residence, and by what method,” the page reads. “It should also ensure that statistics are separated by category: spontaneous miscarriage; treatments that incidentally result in the death of a child (such as chemotherapy); stillbirths; and induced abortion.”\n\nThe section goes on to say “miscarriage management or standard ectopic pregnancy treatments should never be conflated with abortion,” which it said should be defined as “only those procedures that intentionally end an unborn child’s life.”\n\nProject 2025 said it is “ultimately up to (the) president ... to decide which recommendations to implement,” though Trump embraced many of the Heritage Foundation’s policy proposals during his first administration.\n\n-BrieAnna Frank\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester claim: Trump created Project 2025\n\n“Donald Trump, he has, with his friends, said the quiet parts out loud. Not only said them out loud, he wrote a book about it. What’s it called? Project 2025.”\n\nProject 2025 is a political playbook created by the Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative groups. The playbook, also known as the Presidential Transition Project, is more than 900 pages long and includes policy recommendations for the next Republican president.\n\nBut it’s not a direct Trump creation. The Heritage Foundation has said the project “does not speak for any candidate or campaign,” and Trump has called it “extreme” and sought to distance himself some of from its proposals.\n\nThere are, however, numerous Trump allies involved in the project. They include Paul Dans, former chief of staff at the Office of Personnel Management during Trump’s administration, and Russell Vought, former director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nThere is also overlap in policy proposals between the two parties, which include dismantling the Department of Education and ending illegal immigration.\n\n- BrieAnna Frank\n\nJared Polis claim: Project 2025 says the 'only legitimate family' includes a working father and stay-at-home mother\n\n“Page 451 says the only legitimate family is a married mother and father where only the father works.”\n\nThe Colorado governor is misrepresenting the family structures described on page 451 of Project 2025. The Heritage Foundation’s political playbook promotes the idea of “stable and flourishing married families” in this section but doesn’t provide a description of the “only legitimate family” or say anything about stay-at-home mothers.\n\n“Families comprised of a married mother, father and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society,” reads the start of the section.\n\nThe chapter goes on to criticize President Joe Biden’s family-related policies and promotes the importance of working fathers and the benefits of paternal involvement.\n\nThough the section doesn’t overtly mention stay-at-home mothers, it suggests providing funding directly to parents rather than providing universal daycare \"to offset the cost of staying home with a child or to pay for familial, in-home childcare.\"\n\nFull fact check: Project 2025 touts benefits of 'stable, married, nuclear families\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nDNC background: Our fact checks on abortion, LGBTQ-related claims\n\nDay 3 of the DNC brings a focus on abortion and LGBTQ rights, dubbed by the convention as \"A Fight for our Freedoms.\"\n\nHere are some of the past claims USA TODAY has debunked in those veins:\n\n-Eric Litke\n\nDNC background: Ukraine conflict spurs debate leading up to 2024 election\n\nWe’re likely to hear about the war in Ukraine at the DNC, as the conflict remains a key issue among Democrats more than two years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nMany members of the GOP have opposed the U.S.’s ongoing aid to Ukraine, arguing that taxpayer funds would be better spent on domestic issues. Meanwhile, Biden has continued to display unwavering support for the country, signing a 10-year security agreement in June pledging military aid for the next decade of its conflict with Russia.\n\nHarris has mostly mirrored Biden’s foreign policy in this respect, denouncing Russia’s “crimes against humanity” in Ukraine and announcing a $1.5 billion aid package that will provide assistance with energy, humanitarian relief and civilian security in the country.\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked numerous claims about the war in Ukraine:\n\nDNC background: Israel-Hamas conflict divides voters\n\nThe war in Gaza remains a hot-button issue for politicians and voters alike as the conflict nears the one-year mark. It is likely to be a topic of discussion at the DNC as protestors organize on the streets surrounding the Chicago convention hall.\n\nYoung voters and even prominent Democratic donors have expressed their disapproval of Biden’s approach to the war, calling for an immediate ceasefire and an end to the U.S.’s ongoing military aid to Israel.\n\nIn comparison, Harris has been more outspoken about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, igniting hope in some progressive voters.\n\nWhile Harris has reaffirmed the Biden administration’s view that Israel has the right to defend itself from Hamas, she has publicly expressed concerns about the human suffering in Gaza. In December, she said Israel \"must do more to protect civilian life” and in March called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza because of the \"humanitarian catastrophe.\" She said in a December speech in Dubai that “international humanitarian law must be respected.\"\n\nConversely, Republicans have criticized Biden for not doing enough to support Israel and have denounced the pro-Palestinian protests taking place across the country. Former President Donald Trump went so far as to say in a March interview that Democrats “hate Israel” and any Jewish person supporting them “hates their religion.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked numerous claims about Israel and the war in Gaza:\n\n-Hannah Hudnall\n\nDNC background: False claims spread on Walz’s career, record\n\nTim Walz, tonight’s keynote speaker at the DNC in Chicago, has been the subject of an array of false and misleading claims since Vice President Kamala Harris announced Walz as her running mate in early August.\n\nThe Minnesota governor, 60, spent his childhood in Nebraska, joined the National Guard after high school and worked as a high school social studies teacher and football coach. He was a coach at Mankato West High School when it won a state championship in 1999, contrary to some posts on social media.\n\nHis political career began when he volunteered for John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Three years later, he won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served multiple terms. He was elected governor of Minnesota in 2018.\n\nWalz was still in office on May 25, 2020, when a bystander’s video of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin holding his knee on George Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes began to spread online, leading to protests across the country. Walz – not Trump, as some have falsely claimed – activated the National Guard when demonstrations in Minneapolis spiraled out of control.\n\nHarris first introduced Walz during a campaign rally in Philadelphia.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, September 19th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today the Fed has lowered its key interest rate. What's that mean for the economy? Plus the latest from Lebanon after more handheld device attacks, and the Teamsters won't endorse Harris or Trump. What could that mean for the election?\n\n♦\n\nThe Federal Reserve lowered its key interest rate by a half percentage point yesterday, moving ahead with its first rate cut in four years. I spoke with USA TODAY economics and jobs reporter Paul Davidson to help put the move in context. Paul, thanks for hopping on The Excerpt today.\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nNo problem, Taylor. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Paul, what did the Federal Reserve decide on its key interest rate yesterday?\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nYeah, the Federal Reserve decided to cut its key interest rate by a relatively large half a percentage point. It had a choice between a half percentage point and a quarter point basically, and it decided to go big. It went with the larger cut, the first rate cut in four years. Its key rate affects rates throughout the economy, such as mortgage rates, credit card rates, auto loan rates, corporate bond rates. So it was a pretty significant, even historic, decision. It had hiked rates very rapidly while inflation was rising very sharply during and after COVID, and inflation finally has come down, and the Fed decided to pivot and start cutting rates to boost the economy in the job market.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, so, Paul, was this a surprising move, and what really led to this decision?\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nIt depends on who you ask. It was kind of a coin toss coming into the meeting. Markets, futures markets, which try to predict where the Fed's going to go, had started predicting a bigger half-point cut. But meanwhile, a lot of economic research firms were still figuring quarter-point cut because the Fed's been so cautious and been so patient at the lower rates too soon. They wanted to make sure inflation was under control, so they'd been pretty conservative. I wouldn't say it was surprising because markets really were looking for the larger cut to get started as the Fed turns more to trying to boost the economy rather than ease inflation. But I think it did probably surprise a lot of people that think of the Fed as being a little more cautious the last couple of years because of high inflation.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPaul, forward-looking here. What did the Fed's forecast in terms of cuts for the rest of this year and also beyond into '25?\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nSo even though the Fed started with a bang half point cut, which probably should make markets happy, it's not really going for half point cuts from now on. It's going to settle into more of a moderate measured pace. So the next couple meetings, November and December, it looks like the Fed is going to cut rates by a quarter point, and then it's looking for a full percentage point next year, which is fairly measured. It's sort of one quarter point cut every other meeting or four quarter point cuts for the year. It's looking for continued cuts as inflation continues to come down toward the Fed's goal and the Fed is trying to keep the job market healthy and the economy healthy, and then another couple of cuts ratcheting down to a couple of cuts in 2026. So basically, it's a fast start and then a more measured pace because the Fed thinks the job market is still in pretty good shape and the economy's in pretty good shape, but it wants to prevent it from spiraling down and it wants to keep it where it is today.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat does all this mean really more broadly, Paul, when we're talking about inflation, the job market, and the economy as a whole right now?\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nWell, the Fed hopes that what it's doing and what it did was kind of thread the needle. What it's trying to achieve, and sort of you might say Fed speak, is a soft landing, and a soft landing means you're boosting your interest rates to lower inflation. But you're doing it in a way, in a sort of very nuanced, delicate way, so that you don't cause recession. You do it moderately, but then you pull back when necessary and you start lowering rates. It's a sort of difficult feat to pull off. A lot of times in the past when the Fed has increased rates to bring down inflation, it has caused a recession because it's hard to achieve that balance. But the Fed seems to be on the path to succeeding, and so it looks like rates are still high, and that should help continue to bring down inflation.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed is taking action as the job market wobbles a little bit. It's taking action to sort of juice the economy, juice the stock market, and hopefully that keeps the job market from worsening anymore and keeps the economy in good shape too. The big picture is the Fed's hoping that it achieves that ideal. It's not guaranteed. The fact that the Fed is lowering rates now could pick up inflation or keep inflation a little higher, and if they don't go fast enough in lowering rates, the job market could worsen a bit, unemployment could rise, but the Fed believes in hopes. It's kind of threading that needle.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPaul, it's an election fall where weeks away from election night. So I have to throw you this question. Have we heard from the political world at all in the wake of this Fed move?\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nAs you might expect, Democrats have been urging the Fed to cut rates for quite a while now. Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats believe rates have been too high for too long that inflation has been coming down, and they've been nudging and urging the Fed to cut rates sooner, which would help the economy naturally and help the Biden administration because that's the incumbent president and help Vice President Harris and her campaign. Republicans think the Fed should not be cutting rates so much that here you have an election coming up and you have the Fed cutting rates again, which may help the incumbent. So as might be well-predicted, Republicans think the Fed is sort of aiding existing administration. On the other hand, Fed Chair Powell and other Fed officials have been adamant that they don't consider politics at all and they never do. That they're strictly looking to help the economy and help Americans and help consumers and do the right thing and that it was just time to cut interest rates. Inflation is finally getting close to the Fed's goal, and the job market is starting to weaken a little bit.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPaul, great breakdown for us here. Paul Davidson covers economics and jobs for USA TODAY. Thank you, Paul.\n\nPaul Davidson:\n\nThanks very much, Taylor. Happy to do it.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHandheld radios used by Hezbollah detonated yesterday across Lebanon's south. The country's health ministry said 20 people were killed and more than 450 injured in Beirut's suburbs and elsewhere, while the death toll from Tuesday pager explosions rose to 12. Lebanon's government and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group that uses the nation as a base for its militants, both blamed Israel for the attacks on wireless electronic devices. Many people lost eyes and fingers in the blasts. Others suffered serious stomach wounds. Israel has not commented on the mass attack on Hezbollah communications, but multiple reports have said it was carried out by its spy agency, Mossad.\n\nThe operations came alongside Israel's 11-month-old war in Gaza and fears of an escalation on its Lebanese border, along with the risk of a full-blown regional war. Israel and Hezbollah have long been enemies and fought a major war in 2006, but cross-border fighting between the two sides has been stoked by Israel's war in Gaza, and tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to evacuate Northern Israel amid waves of near-deadly Hezbollah missiles since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th. Meanwhile, Israel's defense minister says that the country is opening a new phase in its war with Hamas in Gaza.\n\n♦\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Teamsters Union said yesterday it will not endorse either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in the presidential election. I spoke with USA TODAY White House correspondent Joey Garrison to learn more.\n\nHey there, Joey.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nHey, how's it going?\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood, Joey. Thanks for hopping on. So let's just start here. What decision did the Teamsters make, and what led up to this decision?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nFor months, Teamsters has withheld endorsing in the presidential election, and then on Wednesday, we finally got their answer, and they're not endorsing anyone at all in the '24 presidential election. They opted not to endorse back when Joe Biden was the presumptive democratic nominee, and they maintained that neutral stance for weeks here. They finally met with Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, on Monday for the first time, but they came away with that, still not willing to endorse her. This is a union that typically endorses Democrats like most unions do, but that's not entirely the case. Have endorsed Republicans in the past. Most recently, George Bush senior back in 1988 endorsed Reagan, endorsed Nixon, but not endorsing a Democrat who has campaigned partially on her backing of unions as a big deal in this election.\n\nYou'll remember Sean O'Brien, the Teamsters president, made hay back in July when he spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He became the first Teamsters president to speak at a R.N.C in 121-year history of the union, and that upset a lot of Democrats who were saying, \"Hey, we cited legislative with you on all sorts of issues over the years that are pro union, but you're going to speak at the Republican convention.\" But I think that was a signal that, \"Hey, we might not be going down the traditional road here in terms of backing the Democratic nominee.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, so in terms of what this now functionally might mean for the election, Joey, does this hurt Harris more than Trump?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nIt definitely hurts Harris. He is, just like Biden has, flexed kind of her union credentials here. She's been backed by 9 out of the 10 largest labor unions, including UAW, the main teachers unions, AFL-CIO. This is the one outlier, particularly in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Michigan. Some of the states that still have a fairly large union membership, though much smaller than it used to be decades ago, that can play into the election. Now, interestingly, shortly before Teamsters announced their decision not to endorse, they released polling data that showed their rank-and-file members support Trump at a wider clip than they do Harris. It was by a fairly substantial margin, 58% for Trump and 31% for Harris. So that's a pretty wide gap. Although traditionally, these unions have endorsed the Democratic presidential candidates, that's a big base for Trump that he is trying to get these blue collars, white working class voters, many who have differences of opinion on who they support from their union leadership. In this case, Teamsters looked and surveyed their members, saw that more of them endorsed Trump, and they ultimately did not back Harris.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Joey, how are the two campaigns responding here? How are they framing this decision from the Teamsters?\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nWell, the Harris campaign is actually highlighting a lot of local Teamsters unions that have nonetheless endorsed Harris, kind of breaking ranks with the National Union on that end. Really, every 20 or 30 minutes since this announcement, I've gotten new press releases from the Harris campaign where they have cited another one. So they're arguing, \"Look, I mean, we might not have gotten this endorsement, but make no mistake about it, Kamala Harris is the pro-Union, the neighbor-friendly candidate of these two.\" Conversely, the Trump campaign is citing those polls that I just said, saying, \"Hey, even though the executive board of Teamsters isn't making a formal decision, the vast majority of rank-and-file working men and women...\" This is their statement, \"... want Donald Trump back in the White House.\"\n\nSo they're again making that play right to the rank-and-file members, and this is a union that represents truck drivers, freight workers, a wide assortment of blue collar jobs out there. So that's an important voting block that both candidates are going after, particularly in those three states. I think a lot of these people have already made up their minds one way or another. I wouldn't expect a major polling shift as a result of this, but in terms of campaign infrastructure, assistance, and those sorts of things, having the Teamsters' endorsement would've been a nice boost, particularly for the Harris campaign.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nRight. Interesting stuff here. Joey Garrison is a White House correspondent with USA TODAY. Thank you, Joey.\n\nJoey Garrison:\n\nHey, thanks for having me on.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIranian hackers send people associated with President Joe Biden's campaign unsolicited information that was stolen from former President Donald Trump's campaign, but it was ignored. That's according to the FBI and other federal agencies yesterday. The announcement is the latest in a series of warnings by federal cybersecurity officials about Iran's efforts to meddle in the upcoming election, including taking specific steps to release information about Trump's campaign. That has also included a hack-and-leak spearphishing effort targeting Trump's campaign in retaliation for the former president's actions taken while he was in office, including killing Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps general Qasem Soleimani.\n\n♦\n\nThe nation recorded one of its worst totals for child deaths from the flu this past season, coinciding with troubling drops in US vaccination rates, federal health officials warned. Nearly 200 children died from influenza-related complications in the '23-'24, season according to the CDC. The season's death toll of 199 matches the 2019-2020 flu season, officials said. The highest death toll recorded was 288 children who died from the flu in 2009-2010 at the height of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Most of the 199 total children who died from the virus were eligible for a vaccine but did not receive one. Studies have shown that annual flu vaccines, while not foolproof against infection, are effective against serious illness.\n\n♦\n\nIt's been nearly a decade since the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has been put into place. It's a relatively new grant program that takes aim at the decades-old problem of unprocessed sexual assault kits. Nearly $350 million in grant money went to 90 local and state agencies across the U.S., but for many rape survivors, the program's promise of justice fell short. Many kits still were not tested, and for the ones that had been, few convictions ever arrived. USA TODAY investigative reporter Tricia Nadolny spoke with my co-host Dana Taylor about the year and a half she spent looking into what really happened with America's rape kit backlog.

Or which gets the most visitors each year?\n\nUSA TODAY rounded up answers to the most popular park questions to help travelers better understand these national treasures and share some fun trivia with family and friends on their next park visit.\n\nHere are 10 things to know about America’s national parks.\n\nWhat is the most visited national park in the US?\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains is the most visited national park in America, by far. Last year, it drew nearly three times the visitors as the second-most visited park, Grand Canyon, according to National Park Service data.\n\nThese were the 15 most visited national parks in 2023:\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee - 13,297,647 Grand Canyon in Arizona - 4,733,705 Zion in Utah - 4,623,238 Yellowstone in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming - 4,501,382 Rocky Mountain in Colorado - 4,115,837 Yosemite in California - 3,897,070 Acadia in Maine - 3,879,890 Grand Teton in Wyoming - 3,417,106 Joshua Tree in California - 3,270,404 Olympic National Park in Washington - 2,947,503 Glacier National Park in Montana - 2,933,616 Cuyahoga Valley in Ohio - 2,860,059 Indiana Dunes in Indiana - 2,765,892 Hot Springs in Arkansas - 2,502,967 Bryce Canyon in Utah - 2,461,269\n\nThe least visited national park is Gates of the Arctic in Alaska, which drew 11,045 visitors last year even though there are no roads to get there.“Even for Alaska, Gates of the Arctic is sort of above all the rest in terms of difficulty of reaching it, solitude, remoteness,” Peter Christian, chief spokesperson for Public Affairs for the National Park Service’s Alaska region, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n'Finding hidden gems':America's least visited national parks\n\nWhat are the big 3 national parks?\n\nWhen people think of national parks, three loom large in many minds: Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite.\n\nHowever, they’re neither the three most visited national parks nor the largest in size.\n\nWhat is the largest US national park?\n\nWrangell-St. Elias is the biggest of all. It’s more than three times the size of Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks combined.\n\nThe three biggest national parks are all in Alaska:\n\nWrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve - 13.2 million acres Gates of the Arctic National Park & Preserve - nearly 8.5 million acres Denali National Park & Preserve - more than 4.7 million acres\n\nThe smallest national park is Gateway Arch in Missouri, at roughly 91 acres.\n\nWhat is the newest national park?\n\nNew River Gorge, in West Virginia, became America’s newest national park in December 2020.\n\nIt was previously designated a national river.\n\nStory continues below.\n\nHow many national parks are in the US?\n\nThere are 63 national parks across the country, including two in U.S. territories.\n\nUSA TODAY has been spotlighting each one in a yearlong series that shares insights and tips from the park rangers who know them best.\n\nHas anyone been to all 63 national parks?\n\nYes. Multiple people have accomplished this bucket list feat, including Stefanie Payne, who visited all 63 parks within one year and wrote about them in \"100 Things to See in the National Parks.\"\n\n“The Alaska parks are the ones that are deepest in my heart because they are in such a remote and rugged landscape,” she previously told USA TODAY. “It's really just mind-bending to be in some of those areas, especially when the mountains are so big and the glaciers and the terrain is really challenging and you start to see what you're made of.”\n\nWhat state has the best national parks?\n\nMany national parks fans point to Utah’s Mighty Five: Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef and Zion, but best is subjective.\n\n“I'm sure every park is like, ‘Everywhere is the best.’ It's all so good, right?” Petrified Forest National Park park ranger Jessica Barnett told USA TODAY.\n\nWhich state has the most number of national parks?\n\nCalifornia has the most national parks, with nine: Channel Islands, Death Valley, Joshua Tree, Kings Canyon, Lassen Volcanic, Pinnacles, Redwood, Sequoia, and Yosemite.\n\nDeath Valley actually straddles California and Nevada. A number of America’s national parks span multiple states.\n\nWhat state has no national park?\n\nThere are no national parks in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont or Wisconsin.\n\nHowever, all 50 states are home to other National Park Service units, like national battlefields and seashores, which are sometimes called parks.\n\nThe National Park System currently has 429 units. The most recent addition is Amanche National Historic Site in Colorado. Travelers can find sites by state on the National Park Service’s website.\n\nWhat is a national park a park for?\n\nWhen Yellowstone became America’s first national park in 1872, Congress designated it “a public park or pleasuring ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people,” but national parks have come to offer and protect much more.\n\n“The National Park Service preserves unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations,” according the mission shared on its website.\n\nTo help protect these spaces, visitors are asked to leave no trace.\n\nContributing: Bailey Schulz, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/national-parks/2023/02/27/most-visited-america-national-park/11338691002/", "title": "America's most popular parks include a few you may not recognize", "text": "Great Smoky Mountains remains America's most visited national park by a long shot.\n\nNearly 13 million people visited the park straddling North Carolina and Tennessee last year, according to newly released National Park Service numbers.

Many people drive through the park on the way to another destination. But the park’s appeal can’t be underestimated. The Smokies are truly, well, great.\n\n“I've been here almost 24 years, and I truly understand why it's not called the So So Smoky Mountains,” chuckled park ranger Brad Free. “Really, I think it should be called the Awesome Smoky Mountains.”\n\nHere’s why and what travelers should know about the Great Smoky Mountains, the latest national park in USA TODAY’s yearlong series:\n\nWhat is special about Great Smoky Mountains National Park?\n\n“It's just so diverse in so many different ways,” Free said, citing the array of plants, animals, geology and human history within the park. “It’s just a beautiful place.”\n\nAlong with that beauty is a sense of belonging that many visitors and rangers experience at the park.\n\n“It's like going home to your grandparents,” he said. “This is a great place to come and just say ‘Ah, I want to hug my mountains.’ “\n\n‘These are my people’:How Dolly Parton stays true to her Smokies roots at Dollywood\n\nWhere are the Great Smoky Mountains located?\n\nThe park stretches across more than 522,000 acres of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina.\n\nIts two visitor centers are located near Cherokee, North Carolina, and Gatlinburg, Tennessee.\n\nThe closest airport to the park’s Gatlinburg entrance is McGhee-Tyson Airport, which is about 45 miles away, near Knoxville. The closest airport to the Cherokee entrance is Asheville Regional Airport, which is about 60 miles away.\n\nWhy are the Smokies called the Smokies?\n\nThe name stems from the Cherokee term for the area, which translates to “place of the blue smoke,” according to Free and the Tennessee State Museum.\n\nSevier County Tennessee’s tourism website, Visit My Smokies, explains that signature smoke is “actually fog that comes from the area’s vegetation.”\n\nDid the Cherokee live in the Smoky Mountains?\n\n“The Cherokee have been here for thousands of years,” Free said.\n\nThe Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians still share their rich culture with visitors in Cherokee, North Carolina, a destination unto itself just outside the park.\n\nFree noted there doesn’t appear to have been any permanent Cherokee villages within the park proper, but they hunted and gathered there, as evidenced by 9,000-year-old arrowheads found in the park.\n\n“The early European explorers and settlers that came through here learned so much about how to survive in these mountains from the Cherokee that were here,” he said.\n\nWhat is the entrance fee for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park?\n\nThere are no fees to enter the park. However, parking fees are required for any vehicle parking in the park for longer than 15 minutes.\n\nParking passes cost $5 for one day, $15 for seven days and $40 for annual parking.\n\nCan you just drive through Smoky Mountains National Park?\n\nYes. “A lot of people find us by accident. They don’t even know a national park is here. They’re just driving through,” Free said.\n\nOther visitors come just for a scenic drive, but Free said to really know the park, visitors need to get out and hit the trails.\n\nIt's not just the Smokies:Visiting the not-so-hidden gems of Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge\n\nWhich entrance is best for Great Smoky Mountains National Park?\n\n“It really depends on what you’re looking for,” Free said.\n\nThe busy Gatlinburg entrance is popular among visitors coupling park time with vacationing in Gatlinburg or nearby Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, home of Dollywood.\n\nThe Cherokee entrance is less crowded and very scenic, with numerous streams. “It actually takes you over the mountain and back over to this side over here, which is I think a very pretty drive,” Free said.\n\nA third option is a park entrance near Townsend, Tennessee.\n\n“It really only takes you into our Cades Cove area of the park, which is probably one of the busiest places in the park,” Free said.\n\nWhat is the best month to visit Great Smoky Mountains?\n\nThe busiest months in the park are May through October, but Free said, “Each season has something, really a gift for everybody.”\n\nHe cited wildflowers in the spring, greenery in the summer and the rainbow of colors in the fall. He loves the wintertime in the park when crowds fade and the mountains really come into view.\n\n“It’s kind of like if I shave my beard, you see my face. That’s kind of what happens when the leaves fall off,” he said. “You can see the faces of the mountains, you see the heartbeat of the mountains through the wintertime. And walking through the woods with a little fresh fallen snow and nothing else around, there is nothing else like that.”\n\nWhat should you not miss in the Smoky Mountains?\n\nFrom Cades Cove to Clingmans Dome, the highest point in the park, there is so much to see at Great Smoky Mountain National Park. No one corner covers it all, but Free said the Alum Cave trail comes close.\n\n“It's a 5-mile round trip, but that trail there has pretty much everything the park offers on the trail, except for a waterfall,” he said. “It's got streams, got geology, got elevation, got views, got old growth forest … If you do one trail, do that trail.”\n\nHow many days do you need at Great Smoky Mountains?\n\nFree recommends at least two days in the park, with one day spent in the higher elevations and another day in the lower elevations.\n\n“But all that's going to do is just get your taste buds ready for something else,” he smiled, adding that five days would provide a better foundation. “I’ve been here a long time, and I still haven't done everything.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/national-parks/2024/06/04/great-smoky-mountains-national-park-accessibility/73905273007/", "title": "Great Smoky Mountains National Park offers adaptive hiking, kayaking", "text": "The National Park Service launched adaptive programming in 2023 to make Great Smoky Mountains National Park more accessible for visitors with disabilities.\n\nThe park will host adaptive ranger-led programming this year from June 8 to Oct. 5.\n\nVisitors can choose from bike rides and hikes (including one with a boat tour), along with new kayaking and camping options.\n\nOn a recent afternoon in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Carly Pearson’s hiking gear had three wheels.\n\nPearson, who is paralyzed below the waist following an injury she sustained as a wildland firefighter, used an all-terrain wheelchair to maneuver around tree roots, mud and other hikers on her way to a nearby waterfall.\n\nJust two years ago, that wouldn’t have been possible.

Look at this waterfall right now,’ and give her the opportunity to be immersed in nature,” said Pearson, who is an Americans with Disabilities Act coordinator for Knox County in Tennessee and an ambassador and volunteer for adaptive recreation nonprofit Catalyst Sports, both of which are park service partners.\n\nAfter debuting in 2023, the offerings have been expanded this year. “We want the park to be an inclusive outdoor community where members of the public can come with their family and friends, and they can go on a hike together no matter what their abilities are,” said park ranger Katie Corrigan.\n\nIs Great Smoky Mountains National Park accessible?\n\nThe park, which straddles North Carolina and Tennessee, will host adaptive ranger-led programming this year from June 8 to Oct. 5. Visitors can choose from bike rides and hikes (including one with a boat tour), along with new kayaking and camping options. A full list is available on Catalyst’s website.\n\nFor visitors who want to explore on their own, the park has four GRIT Freedom Chairs – three for adults and one junior chair – available for checkout. The equipment can be used on roughly 12 miles of trails across various sections of the park.\n\nVisitors should note that the chairs require some upper-body mobility to operate independently. “If you are a person that doesn't have use of your arms, the levers can be removed and someone can just push it,” Corrigan said. All users must have a companion with them, such as a friend or a park volunteer.\n\nHow do I register for the park’s adaptive programming?\n\nParticipants can register online for ranger-led programs. Activities are typically offered in morning and afternoon sessions.\n\nWheelchairs are available on a first-come, first-served basis Monday-Tuesday at the park’s Sugarlands Visitor Center. On Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, visitors can reserve the chairs for specific times. Reservations for this year opened on Saturday.\n\nAs of Oct. 1, the chairs will be available first come, first served only (though that could change and will be reflected on the park's website).\n\nThe park saw high demand when it first offered the chairs last summer. “Oftentimes, we get more requests than we have chairs or people or people to help check them out,” said Corrigan. They are working to train more volunteers and looking into adding other equipment.\n\nAccessible travel:What national parks can do to make the outdoors more accessible to people with disabilities\n\nHow much does the park’s adaptive programming cost?\n\nBoth the ranger-led programming and the wheelchairs are free for visitors.\n\n“This is everyone's park,” said Pearson. “We should all be able to enjoy it. We should all be included.”\n\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

For example, a mask will be required when a trail is too narrow or is busy, on overlooks or in historic homes.\n\nIn addition to bringing a mask, visit the website for any park you plan to visit to see what is and isn't open. Parks across the country continue to evaluate and adapt to changing COVID-19 guidance, and may adjust operations as needed.\n\nVisiting a reopened national park after lockdown? Here's what it's like\n\n6. Yellowstone National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4 million in 2019\n\nYellowstone National Park (mostly within Wyoming but with sections in Montana and Idaho) is famed for its majestic geysers that can send water shooting over one hundred feet into the air. Since the park itself sits atop a volcano, it’s blessed not only with the geysers but with hot springs, waterfalls, mud pots and the type of trout fishing that would make any enthusiast giddy.\n\nAnd, don’t be surprised to see a moose or wolf on your path – this park is known to be home to these and other animals such as bison, bears, and buffalo.\n\nTie for No. 4. Yosemite National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.5 million in 2019\n\nTaking in the largest waterfall in North America (Yosemite Falls) and the world’s tallest granite monolith (El Capitan) are just two of the reasons why Yosemite National Park in California is one to check off-your bucket list. Get lost in its picturesque Crane Flat area, go horseback riding, or take a guided nature walk of the Sequoia Parks.\n\nOff-premise, you can also fill your calendar with activities like art workshops, visit a local history center, take a ghost tour, dine at an organic farm-to-table cafe, rent a bike to take the trails, spend a day at the nearby aqua park, go white water rafting, take an aerial tour or stop by the local winery.\n\nNote: With the California regional stay-at-home order lifted, the park is no longer closing early. But beginning Feb. 8, you need a reservation if you plan on driving into Yosemite.\n\nTie for No. 4: Zion National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.5 million in 2019\n\nUtah’s first national park is one of the most visited in the nation. It comes in at number four on the list. Zion is known for its massive sandstone cliffs and vast array of plants and animals. Birdwatchers can get a shot at viewing up to 291 species of birds, including the peregrine falcon, the Mexican spotted owl and the proud bald eagle (check out the full Zion bird list here).\n\n3. Rocky Mountain National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 4.7 million in 2019\n\nRocky Mountain National Park in Colorado is a hiker’s paradise and comes in at No. 3. There’s over 300 trails to choose from (find a full list here). It also has the highest paved roads of any park. Although it's currently closed for the winter, Trail Ridge Road crests at over 12,000 feet and offers many opportunities to stop and gaze at the subalpine and alpine ecosystems (call 970-586-1222 to see which roads are open due to weather conditions). During the winter months, outdoor enthusiasts can try snowshoeing or snowmobiling.\n\nNote: The park recently announced that timed-entry reservations are no longer required. The reservation system was implemented last year for visitors during the pandemic.\n\n2. Grand Canyon National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 6 million in 2019\n\nLocated entirely in North Arizona, the Grand Canyon is a one-of-a-kind trip with more to do in one place than in any other park. Home to over 300 different species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, the vast array of wildlife combined with beauty scenery leads many outdoor enthusiasts craving to explore this well-known wonder.\n\nThe South Rim of the park gets the warmth of Arizona while the North Rim is prone to snowfall. So, there’s a much shorter window to enjoy the season on the northern side. Be sure to stop for gas, check the weather, pack plenty of food and clothes and make any camping reservations in advance.\n\n1. Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\nNumber of visitors: 12.5 million in 2019\n\nThe Great Smoky Mountains, nestled on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, attracts the most recreational visitors out of any other national park in the US.\n\nVisitors can start the day with a kid-friendly hike and explore captivating waterfalls, or plan a picnic in Cades Cove while keeping an eye out for those famous black bears.\n\nGuests can enjoy the preserved history of the national park’s historic homes set among a pristine mountain landscape. Overnight visitors may choose backpack camping, rent a cabin or check into one of their nearby condos. If you prefer to spend your time traveling via horseback, take in all the park has to offer from the saddle.\n\nAdditional reporting by Emmalyn Reid, a freelance writer for Broadry Newsroom", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/america/2016/02/22/americas-50-most-visited-national-parks-2015/80624700/", "title": "National Park Week: America's most visited parks", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nNational Park Week runs from April 15-23, with free admission to all national parks on the weekend of April 22 and 23.

At least 37 people, including two children, were killed and thousands wounded in two waves of attacks this week. Lebanon's government and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed group that uses the nation as a base for its militants, both blamed Israel. Israel has not claimed responsibility for the attacks directly, but anyone who pays attention to the Middle East understands that this operation almost certainly originated in Tel Aviv.\n\nOn Friday, Israel launched an airstrike that reportedly killed senior Hezbollah commander Ibrahim Aqil in Beirut. Israeli officials said Hezbollah later fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel.\n\nWar has always involved sabotage. But the morality and legality of sabotaging pagers is highly questionable. As is its wisdom.\n\nWhen you turn pagers into bombs, you have to know that there will be a high risk of collateral damage. The pagers belonged not just to military members of Hezbollah, but also medical staff and others.\n\nAs an American, I support Israel with my tax dollars\n\nIn the past, when Israel targeted specific cellphone users, including killing a bomb maker working for Hamas, it seemed like a much better way to respond to terrorism − with minimal risk of collateral civilian deaths, as compared with, say, a missile strike on an apartment.This time, an entire nation, Lebanon, has been terrorized. Its medical facilities are straining to handle all the bomb victims. Some in Lebanon are comparing the feeling of insecurity to the awful aftermath of the 2020 Beirut dock explosion.Hezbollah is helping Hamas, and both groups kill Israeli civilians without mercy or regret. They kill Israeli children when they can. I have no illusions about their methods. But I don't financially and politically support Hamas or Hezbollah.\n\nAs an American, I financially support Israel with my tax dollars. If they are murdering Lebanese children, then to some extent, I did that.\n\nOPINION:Hamas murders more hostages. Biden must do more to save them.\n\nAnd how, exactly, is this helping Israel? Is there a chance Hezbollah goes, \"Well, we didn't realize how dangerous Israel was, let's negotiate.\" The cyber attack has shaken the hornets’ nest and killed a few terrorists, that's all.\n\nSure, Hezbollah’s ability to communicate internally has been gravely damaged, at least momentarily. But this tactic is spurring anger at Israel across all sectors of Lebanese society, and indeed, the Arab world. Iraq is sending medical supplies to Lebanon; Egypt is expressing solidarity.\n\nWill it be harder or easier for Hezbollah to get recruits? The pager and walkie-talkie explosions killed and wounded a few fighters, but there will be three or four replacements for each one who fell.\n\nHezbollah has always been a terrible challenge for Israel. It’s a non-state actor, with a military force far stronger than Lebanon's national army. A few years ago, I asked a Lebanese government minister how a fight between Hezbollah and the Lebanese military would go, and he predicted that Hezbollah would win in a week.\n\nHezbollah also is funded by Iran, and gets more sophisticated weaponry every year. Compared with Hamas, Hezbollah has always been far more potent as a military force.\n\nAttacks may hurt Israel in the long term\n\nThe long-term hope for Israel in its relationship with Lebanon has to be that Hezbollah is eventually brought under control of the political authorities in Beirut, and that a coalition of Sunni, Druze, Christian and moderate Shiite leaders makes peace with Israel.\n\nThat is the dream, but also the only realistic way the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel ends well.\n\nOPINION:My father survived the Holocaust. Why are students taking part in a new call to violence?\n\nThe cyber attack just pushed that day off by years. Is a massive sabotage of devices as bad as a Hamas bus bombing, which indiscriminately killed Israelis? No, but Israel should remember what happened when bus bombings left body parts all over the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The attacks devastated the Israeli left, the side that had been working for peace and even a two-state solution. They unified the nation around harder policies against Palestinians.\n\nThey strengthened Israel’s will to fight.\n\nThat’s what’s happening in Lebanon, as even Hezbollah’s fiercest opponents are now rallying to their support.\n\nIt also will inevitably cause more and more Americans to wonder if we should be such strong supporters of a nation that uses tactics that terrorize an entire country and inevitably leave behind dead and wounded children.\n\nJeremy Mayer is an associate professor in the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, where he also directs the master's and Ph.D. programs in political science.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/20"}]}

Browne is an artist in residence in Sylacauga whose commissioned work includes a Helen Keller statue in 2017; Giorgi is a master carver from Pietrasanta.

Some carcasses had lost hair, and NOAA Fisheries hopes to determine if that was due to decomposition or abnormal molting. The agency noted the importance of ice seals to Alaska Native coastal communities. Bearded, ringed and spotted seals were reported dead south of Nome and north of the Bering Strait. A hunter counted 18 carcasses along 11 miles of shore north of the village of Kotlik and dozens of others along an island near Stebbins. Eight young bearded seals were found Monday on St. Lawrence Island. North of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea, a National Park Service biologist counted six dead seals near Kotzebue’s airport. NOAA Fisheries also received accounts of up to 30 dead seals between Kivalina and Point Hope.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Sales taxes have gone uncollected because of flaws in a new state program created to make the process more efficient, according to auditors. The Arizona Department of Revenue failed to identify many businesses that weren’t paying taxes and erased active businesses from its tracking system, says a recent report by the Arizona auditor general. Some cities and counties, which were assured they no longer had to deal with sales tax collection issues, now are assigning staff again to assure their cities get the money they are owed. The Department of Revenue fully took over auditing and collecting sales taxes for all cities, towns and counties in 2017. More than a year later, the auditor general showed the Department of Revenue was auditing significantly fewer businesses and, at one point, had completely stopped checking whether businesses had licenses.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Police Department announced Wednesday it is overhauling policies for obtaining no-knock warrants in drug raids, eight months after a man alleged officers blasted down his door and raided his apartment without probable cause. Police Chief Keith Humphrey said at a news conference that the department will now use more detailed information when determining whether a no-knock warrant is reasonable. In October, Roderick Talley said he was suing the department and the city, alleging police lied to obtain a no-knock warrant and used similar boiler-plate language on dozens of other warrants. He showed video footage from outside of his home that he said proved officers lied when they claimed they witnessed a confidential informant buying cocaine from Talley. Footage showed the informant ringing Talley’s doorbell and leaving minutes later – after no one answered the door.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State judges say prison inmates can legally have small amounts of marijuana – if they don’t inhale. The 3rd District Court of Appeal ruled Tuesday that California voters in 2016 legalized recreational possession of less than an ounce of cannabis with no exception – even for those behind bars. The court overturned the convictions of five inmates who were found with marijuana in their prison cells. However, the three-judge court said state law does prohibit smoking or ingesting pot in prison. Also, officials can still punish possession as a rules violation – and corrections officials say pot possession is still against those rules. Attorney General Xavier Becerra’s office says it’s reviewing the appellate court ruling but didn’t say whether it will appeal.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Casinos in the state saw an increase in combined 2018 revenue that set a record for the state. The Denver Post reports that casinos in Black Hawk, Central City and Cripple Creek reaped combined revenue of $842.1 million last year. The American Gaming Association says the figure is a 1.7% increase over the state’s $828 million take in 2017 and a nearly 13% increase over 2014. The association’s 2019 edition of its “State of the States” roundup found 12 of 24 states with legalized commercial gambling enjoyed record revenues last year. The association says the industry brought in an all-time national high of $41.7 billion in 2018, a 3.5% increase over 2017. Officials say Colorado still lacks legal sports betting, which contributed significantly to the national increase.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: A popular state park is reopening more than a year after it was hit by a tornado that brought down thousands of trees. Gov. Ned Lamont says Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden will reopen to the public beginning at 8 a.m. Friday. State workers and volunteers have spent months clearing the extensive trails in the 1,400-acre park, named for its 2-mile ridge that resembles a man in repose. The park has been closed since the storm hit on May 15, 2018. Final work on restoration of the main Tower Trail was completed earlier this week. The cost of the restoration work has totaled about $735,000. The state anticipates that about 75% of that will be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Black-and-white license plates are coveted as a sign of prestige in the First State. They’re reserved only for low-digit tag numbers, and people bid thousands of dollars for them. Yet they suddenly seem to be everywhere. Turns out a lot of them are “illegal tags,” says C.R. McLeod, community relations manager for the Delaware Department of Transportation. Jordan Irazabal, who is behind the Facebook page and website TheDelaware3000.org, has for the past 11 1/ 2 years been trying to find and photograph the 3,000 lowest Delaware tag numbers and running into what he says is a disturbing trend. Irazabal says he finds the fakes offensive and has started a petition asking police to crack down on people with unauthorized plates.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The street outside NASA’s headquarters in the capital has been renamed “Hidden Figures Way” to honor the black female mathematicians who helped send humans to the moon. News outlets report district officials, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and others gathered Wednesday to unveil the new street sign. “Hidden Figures” author Margot Lee Shetterly and the families of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson also attended the event. Shetterly’s 2016 book details the struggles of the women as they crunched numbers at the NASA Langley Research Center in the pre-computer age. Cruz in August proposed renaming E Street SW through the Hidden Figures Way Designation Act, which passed in December.\n\nFlorida\n\nBig Pine Key: Marine researchers have finished a 10-day assessment of the iconic green sea turtle in the Florida Keys. The study completed Wednesday examined where green turtles live and feed in Keys waters and evaluated green turtles’ general health. Data acquired from 26 green turtles included measurements, skin biopsies and bloodwork. All were released except for three that are being treated at the Florida Keys-based Turtle Hospital for Fibropapillomatosis, a herpes-like virus that affects turtles worldwide. The effort was a collaboration of the Turtle Hospital, other marine research groups and Force Blue, a nonprofit that aids returning combat veterans through mission-focused programs to help the world’s ocean environment. Green sea turtles in the southern Atlantic Ocean are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRoswell: The city could begin penalizing hotels that burden police with an outsized number of calls for help. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports a hotel safety ordinance was proposed for Roswell on Tuesday by City Council member Mike Palermo. He says there are just a few hotels in town that burden taxpayers with frequent calls for help. The newspaper says most of the calls involved drug use and prostitution. The proposed bill would punish these hotels by dividing 911 calls by the number of rooms and charging offenders accordingly. A similar act that passed narrowly in Alpharetta last month would require a 100-room hotel making 42 calls for police service in a year to hire an off-duty police officer nightly for $90,000 a year. The law would not penalize medical and fire calls.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A snake stowed away in a man’s bag and remained undetected until it completed the trip from Florida to Hawaii, officials said. The southern black racer snake slithered out of the man’s backpack when he arrived on Maui on Monday, KGMB-TV reports. Snakes have no natural predators in Hawaii and pose a threat to Hawaii’s native species. The Virginia man was not aware of the animal until it emerged after he arrived at a vacation rental property in the community of Pukalani, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The non-venomous snake measured about a foot long and a quarter-inch in diameter, officials said. The property owner told the visitor that snakes are illegal in Hawaii and alerted police, who captured the snake along with state Department of Land and Natural Resources personnel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court says law enforcement officers can’t arrest someone for a misdemeanor unless they have a warrant or actually saw the crime being committed. The unanimous ruling made Wednesday has advocacy organizations scrambling because it likely means police will have to dramatically change how they respond to domestic violence calls. The ruling came in a drug conviction case, but the high court noted the Idaho Constitution’s provision against unlawful search and seizure doesn’t allow warrantless arrests without probable cause. That means no misdemeanor arrests unless the officer saw the crime. Officers responding to domestic violence calls often arrest the person they suspect of committing the violence on a misdemeanor charge as a way of separating those involved and defusing the situation.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Abraham Lincoln history buffs will have the chance to learn more about the courtship and marriage of Abraham Lincoln and Mary Todd. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is hosting tours over the summer that will let visitors learn about their unexpected romance. It’s called “Abe and Mary: Quite Contrary.” Tour guide Jen Brownell says Lincoln and Todd were different on so many levels from education to temperament, yet they seemed to complement each other. The free tours will be offered Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 10 a.m. until Aug. 7. The tour covers 1.5 miles and will take about an hour. Visitors are encouraged to reserve a space online.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Butler University is planning a $100 million upgrade and expansion of its science facilities that will become the school’s largest single investment to date. The private Indianapolis college announced Thursday that its trustees approved the three-phase project last week. The Indianapolis Business Journal reports the school says the project will create 96,000 square feet of space for a science complex featuring “high-tech classrooms, modern research labs and collaborative working spaces.” Construction on the first two phases is expected to be completed within about 18 months. Butler’s science program enrollment has increased 70% in the past decade, causing the department to outgrow its space. Administrators hope to raise at least $42 million through philanthropy and have already secured $27.5 million in donations. A bond issue will fund the remainder.\n\nIowa\n\nArnolds Park: The Iowa Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame’s hundreds of inductee exhibits have been moved to a new and bigger space in Arnolds Park. They can be found now in the same building that houses the Iowa Great Lakes Maritime Museum. The Hall of Fame had been in the Roof Garden, an open-air complex next to the amusement park. The garden was demolished and is being rebuilt as part of the multimillion-dollar Restore the Park campaign. The new Hall of Fame museum has three times more space than the old version for the photos, videos and memorabilia from bands, musicians and radio personalities. Highlights include recording equipment from Iowa studios, contracts to perform at the Roof Garden that were signed by the likes of Johnny Cash and Roy Orbison, and a bright red suit worn on stage by the late Tommy Bolin, a Sioux City native and guitarist for such bands as Deep Purple and the James Gang.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The new owners of a long-abandoned amusement park want to transform it into an outdoor event center and paintball range. The Wichita Eagle reports that the plan is set to go to the City Council next month after winning approval from planners and neighbors. Councilman James Clendenin says he’s pleased to see some redevelopment finally occurring at the site. He says the area has been a nuisance since Joyland shut down for good in 2006. After years of vandalism, a fire destroyed much of what remained in August 2018. Three months later, Gregory and Tina Dunnegan bought Joyland’s 57 acres at auction for $198,000. A consultant wrote in a site proposal that the owners envision temporary outdoor festivals and amusement rides to “capture the old flavor of Joyland.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Donated blood generally has a six-week shelf life, but University of Louisville researchers are testing a way to convert red blood cells into a longer-lasting powder that potentially could save the lives of soldiers, trauma patients and maybe even astronauts. U of L professors Michael Menze and Jonathan Kopechek, as well as Ph.D. candidate Brett Janis, have spent two years developing this “freeze-dried” approach to storing blood, which has drawn interest from the U.S. military, NASA, emergency responders and other groups. “So many people told us, ‘We really want this. We really need this,’ ” Kopechek said. Menze, Kopechek, Janis and U of L students have devised a process of preserving red blood cells though freezing and dehydration. The powder remains viable at a wider range of temperatures than donated blood, which has to be refrigerated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Justice Department says hate crime charges have been filed in connection with three fires that destroyed African American churches earlier this year. A news release from the department says 21-year-old Holden Matthews faces three counts of intentional damage to religious property. He’s also charged with three counts of using fire to commit a felony. The indictment says the fires were set “because of the religious character” of the properties. Matthews has pleaded not guilty to related state charges. His attorney declined comment on the federal charges. Three historic African American churches were burned over 10 days, beginning in late March, in and around the city of Opelousas. The June 6 federal indictment was unsealed Wednesday.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state legalized medically assisted suicide Wednesday, becoming the eighth in the nation to allow terminally ill people to end their lives with prescribed medication. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who had previously said she was unsure about the bill, signed it in her office. “It is my hope that this law, while respecting the right to personal liberty, will be used sparingly,” Mills said. While still controversial, assisted suicide legislation is winning increasing acceptance in the United States, and this year at least 18 states considered such measures. Maine’s bill would allow doctors to prescribe terminally ill people a fatal dose of medication. The bill declares that obtaining or administering life-ending medication is not suicide under state law, thereby legalizing the practice often called medically assisted suicide.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A jury has awarded nearly $3 million to an inmate who was beaten by prison guards almost six years ago in what his attorney called a “systemwide failure.” The Daily Record of Baltimore reports jurors awarded $2.7 million to Kevin Younger, who was assaulted by officers at the Maryland Reception, Diagnostics & Classification Center in Baltimore in 2013. Officers beat Younger the day after he witnessed other inmates assaulting a guard. Younger’s lawsuit said three officers attacked him as “misplaced retaliation” because they believed he was involved in the attack. Attorney David Daneman said the attack resulted from a “systemwide failure” at the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A lawsuit being filed against state officials says the education funding system shortchanges low-income school districts. Advocates planned to announce the lawsuit at the Statehouse on Thursday on behalf of more than a dozen parents around the state. The plaintiffs argue that the current formula used by the state to distribute education money to school districts violates the civil rights of children in underfunded communities. The lawsuit comes amid behind-the-scenes efforts on Beacon Hill to revamp the 1993 formula which many critics view as outdated and responsible for a widening gap in academic achievement between students from wealthier communities and their less-advantaged urban counterparts. Plans to overhaul the spending formula have been introduced by Democratic lawmakers and Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, but no consensus has been reached.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History is marking Black Music Month with a concert featuring many of Detroit’s prominent musical, visual and literary artists. Singer Joan Belgrave, wife of late jazz trumpeting great Marcus Belgrave, is producing and performing at the June 27 concert, “Our Music Our Lives.” The show aims to explore connections between music and the American black experience. It will include works from slavery through modern times and span several genres, including R&B, jazz, gospel, blues and spoken word. Dance and graphic art also will be featured. Scheduled performers also include Mark Scott of the Miracles, Motown Legends Gospel Choir, poet and playwright Bill Harris, and the Lisa McCall Dancers. Black Music Month was recognized by President Jimmy Carter 40 years ago.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for spring storms and flooding that caused nearly $40 million in damage to infrastructure across the state. Gov. Tim Walz said Wednesday that the declaration will provide federal emergency relief money for 51 Minnesota counties and four tribal governments. Walz had requested the federal aid in a letter to Trump two weeks ago. The governor says that “Minnesota is on the road to recovery,” and the incoming federal money “will expedite that process enormously.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency authorized using federal public assistance funds to reimburse affected communities for response and recovery costs. FEMA will pay 75% of eligible expenses. The state will cover the other 25% from the Disaster Assistance Contingency Account.\n\nMississippi\n\nPicayune: A city worker was passing by a home when he noticed it was on fire and saved a girl inside who had woken up to find smoke filling her room. The Picayune Item reports Stanley Hart saw smoke coming from the house Tuesday morning. Hart and a neighbor, Mark Jones, arrived to find a 15-year-old girl inside who was knocking on the window for help to get out. Hart called 911, and then he and Jones broke the window with a cinder block to rescue the teen. Fire officials say the initial investigation shows the fire started near the kitchen stove. The 15-year-old was airlifted to a hospital in New Orleans. No one else was in the home at the time of the fire.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: This tourist town is getting a new science attraction called WonderWorks. The Orlando, Florida-based operation announced this week that the new location will open in November in the former theater for the Baldknobbers, one of the longest-running country music shows in town. WonderWorks bills itself as “the indoor amusement park for the mind.” Chief operations officer Janine Vaccarello says it appeals to all age groups, with a lot of hands-on activities and themed areas that cater to the interests of the communities where WonderWorks has a presence. The Branson location will have a military room and a space devoted to the city’s history. WonderWorks has five other locations, including in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Panama City Beach, Florida; and Syracuse, New York.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Campers and hikers used to seeing “pack it in, pack it out” signs may soon be seeing some “pull your share” notices as well. The Pull Your Share movement, started by Great Falls High teacher Dan Wilkins three years ago, encourages people to spend five to 15 minutes on their trips pulling out noxious, nonnative knapweed at campgrounds and other sites. An annual Pull Your Share field trip has teachers and students from local high schools heading out to pull the weeds in hopes of encouraging all recreationists to “pull their share.” Since the first year, it’s grown from two students and one teacher to 190 students and nine teachers. Wilkins says knapweed cannot be used by wildlife or domestic livestock and doesn’t have enough nutrition for them to survive.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A city councilman says an ordinance that forces the Muslim owners of a new hookah lounge to serve alcohol in violation of their faith must change. The ordinance requires businesses in Lincoln that allow smoking indoors to have a liquor license. Those businesses must stock and serve booze. The Lincoln Journal-Star reports that Councilman Roy Christensen has been working with city lawyers to write a new ordinance that would allow businesses like 88 Hookah Lounge to operate in compliance with the owners’ faith and local rules. Cigar bars are legal in Nebraska under the state’s Clean Indoor Air Act as long as they do not sell anything else. City Attorney Jeff Kirkpatrick says the difficulty will be drafting a law that allows the hookah lounge to serve non-alcoholic beverages.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The city is closing down some downtown streets as NASA resumes a series of drone tests in high-density urban settings. Beginning Friday, Lake Street will be closed from 1st to 2nd streets from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. through June 20, and again June 23-25. Chism Street also will be closed from Dickerson to 2nd Street from June 14 to July 2. It’s part of the final stage of a four-year effort to develop a national drone traffic management system. NASA and the Nevada Institute for Autonomous Systems conducted initial tests last month, flying drones for the first time above Reno streets beyond the operator’s line of sight. They’re researching emerging technology that someday will be used to manage hundreds of thousands of small unmanned commercial aircraft delivering packages.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: Jenness State Beach is getting an upgrade. The state Parks and Recreation Department is hosting a ribbon-cutting celebration for the new bathhouse at the Rye beach on Friday at 1:30 p.m. The design is similar to the style of the facilities at Hampton Beach State Park and North Hampton State Beach. It features exterior changing rooms, rinse-off showers and a family bathroom. The bathhouse is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily until Labor Day. It replaces the previous bathhouse, built in 1980. Jenness Beach is one of five state park beaches along New Hampshire’s seacoast.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: A little more than a year after the death of celebrity chef and native son Anthony Bourdain, the Garden State is honoring his memory with the launch of the Anthony Bourdain Food Trail, a statewide tribute that includes 10 of the restaurants he visited for a 2015 episode of his CNN food and travel show “Parts Unknown.” The food trail kicked off Thursday and continues Friday with statewide ceremonies featuring Chris Bourdain, the late chef’s brother; New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way; and Jeffrey Vasser, executive director of the New Jersey Division of Travel and Tourism. Thursday’s event locations included Hiram’s Roadstand in Fort Lee and Frank’s Deli in Asbury Park. Sites slated for Friday visits, open to the public, are James’ Salt Water Taffy in Atlantic City and Donkey’s Place in Camden.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Air Force has begun construction on a facility at Kirtland Air Force Base that officials say will play a role in the proposed “space defense.” The Albuquerque Journal reports the Air Force Research Laboratory’s $12.8 million Space Control Laboratory will consolidate efforts on the base. The new facility will include office and lab space for 65 civilian and military contractors. It will contain a 5,000 square-foot high-bay laboratory space and more than 5,000 square feet of secure office, laboratory and meeting space. Air Force Col. Eric Felt says space is now “a war-fighting domain.” President Donald Trump has proposed creating a new U.S. Space Force – a plan that has hit widespread resistance on Capitol Hill.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state would become the 13th to permit driver’s licenses for immigrants who entered the country illegally under legislation passed by the state Assembly on Wednesday. The measure has the support of liberal groups, the state’s largest business organization and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. Yet its fate remains uncertain in the state Senate, which has not scheduled a vote on the bill. During floor debate in the Assembly, Democrats argued that immigrant families deserve to have the same ability to drive given to other New Yorkers. Licensing immigrants, they said, would improve road safety and help the businesses that rely on immigrant employees. “This bill is common sense,” said Assemblyman Marcos Crespo, D-Bronx and sponsor of the legislation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: An increasing number of North Carolinians live with hepatitis C, many unaware they’re infected. In response to a dramatic statewide spike in infections fueled by the opioid crisis, the state launched a multimillion dollar initiative Thursday to fight the virus, seeking to increase access to screenings and treatment. It is funded by biotech company Gilead Sciences and partners with local health care providers and the Harm Reduction Coalition, which advocates for health services for drug users. The state’s health department estimates that 110,000 people in North Carolina live with hepatitis C and that in 2017, 186 people were newly diagnosed, a roughly fivefold increase from a decade earlier. The virus can cause severe liver damage or death. In 2016, the most recent year that data is available, 511 people died in North Carolina of hepatitis C-related causes.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: State residents are donating blood to fill a shortage this summer that a blood transfusion nonprofit says is leaving hospitals in the region without enough donations to meet their needs. Vitalant serves hospitals in North Dakota and parts of South Dakota. The organization’s donor recruitment official, Colleen Scott, tells the Bismarck Tribune that the region’s blood supply was critical in February because of people getting sick and snowstorms affecting blood drives. But she says donations have significantly dropped in the summer months, when people are typically busier. Vitalant is hosting daily blood drives, reaching out to loyal donors and encouraging everyone to bring a friend.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: In honor of LGBTQ Pride month, more than 100 Cincinnati Bell employees used Post-it notes this week to create a Pride mural on the north side of the company’s Atrium 2 headquarters. The mural extends from the 9th floor to the 16th floor and is made up of approximately 26,000 sticky notes put on 96 windows. And for the first time, Cincinnati Bell illuminated its signage on top of Atrium II using Pride colors Wednesday night. Both the mural and the Atrium 2 illumination will remain through the end of June. The company is a corporate sponsor of Cincinnati’s Pride Parade, set for June 22.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Google has announced a $600 million expansion project at a data center in Pryor and a $6 million grant for computer science education for students in 4-H chapters in rural areas of 20 states. The announcement was made Thursday outside the data center. The expansion project is expected to add about 100 jobs to the more than 400 now employed at the center that opened in 2011. National 4-H Council President Jennifer Sirangelo said the grant through Google.org will focus on computer science training for an estimated 1 million children in rural areas that have limited access to computer science education. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the grant will be used to teach coding and leadership skills to students.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city has launched a program to distribute portable toilets in order to reduce cleanup costs and improve public health and hygiene. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Mayor Ted Wheeler proposed the Hygiene Street Response initiative after receiving numerous complaints about human feces in public places. Wheeler says that beyond cleanliness, bathrooms are needed to prevent outbreaks of diseases such as hepatitis A. The city council voted last month to provide $877,000 in funding. Officials say the program will deploy six portable toilets in high-need areas and build mobile bathrooms and shower trailers to be given to nonprofit groups serving the homeless population. A city report says disposal of more than 3,300 gallons of waste, without including other related fees, cost $26,480 for one year.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Dozens of rare 13-star American flags never before exhibited will be on display at the Museum of the American Revolution. Antique flag dealer and expert Jeff Bridgman has loaned the historic flags to the Philadelphia museum for display starting Friday, which is Flag Day. The flags feature 32 arrangements of 13 stars representing the 13 original colonies. There was no official pattern for the stars until 1912. Flag makers had previously arranged the stars however they wanted. A highlight of the display is a nearly 6-foot flag that features 13 stars that roughly form the letters “U” and “S.” Three flags from flag maker Sarah McFadden, known as the “Betsy Ross of New York,” will be on display. “A New Constellation: A Collection of Historic 13-Star Flags” runs through July 14.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCoventry: A man sick of potholes has taken matters into his own hands. WJAR-TV reports that Seth Kerstetter spent his own money Sunday to fill holes on Centre of New England Boulevard in Coventry. Kerstetter was at Home Depot when he decided to purchase supplies and fix the most problematic potholes. He blocked traffic, put out traffic cones and worked for about two hours. The boulevard is lined with shopping centers and apartments. Because it is privately owned, neither the town nor the state is responsible for its upkeep. The road is in receivership and under the supervision of attorney Matthew McGowan. McGowan says because the developer ran out of money, the road was never properly surfaced. He says an effort is underway to find money to fix it.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Autumn the giraffe is pregnant again at the Greenville Zoo. The 13-year-old female Masai giraffe is expected to give birth in early July. Autumn gave birth to her first calf, Kiko, in 2012. Kiko now lives at the Toronto Zoo. She had a second pregnancy in 2014 that ended with a stillborn calf. Autumn later gave birth to Tatu in 2016. Tatu was later transferred to the Lehigh Valley Zoo. In January, Autumn gave birth to Kiden, her first calf to be fathered by Miles, a 10-year-old male giraffe who still lives at Greenville Zoo. Miles is also the father of the expected calf. In the past, Autumn’s previous calves were transferred before she gave birth. This time, Kiden will remain with his parents through the birth. The public can keep an eye on Autumn’s pregnancy progress via the zoo’s webcam.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local artists are taking to the streets, literally, in an effort to keep the area’s rivers healthy. The city’s Downtown Storm Inlet Art Project, now in its third year, aims to remind citizens the dangers of throwing and dumping “litter, debris and hazardous chemicals” into storm drains, which are direct lines to the Big Sioux River running through the heart of Sioux Falls. Artists Molly O’Connor and Ashton Dockendorf painted two of the six new inlets of 2019 on Dakota Avenue last Friday, with motifs depicting the value of aquatic well-being. Eighteen total painted inlets sit along a seven-block stretch. The Big Sioux River could use some help, says Jessica Sexe, the city’s sustainability coordinator. Sediment from farms and lawns has left the Big Sioux listed as an “impaired water body” unsafe for swimming, kayaking and canoeing.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority is ready to clean up and demolish the Allen Fossil plant in South Memphis. But plans to do so are drawing concern from environmental groups that say the cleanup process has not been publicly vetted and involves pumping dangerous amounts of arsenic solids into the Mississippi River. Inactive since March 2018, the once coal-powered Allen plant still contains an estimated 3 million cubic yards of coal ash waste and other combustible residuals. The water near and in these coal ash pits and their stilling ponds was recently ranked among the worst in the nation for contamination due to the high amount of arsenic present in the water. TVA has said its preferred option for cleaning up the coal ash ponds is removal, but doing so involves a process called “dewatering,” a plan the Southern Environmental Law Center has criticized.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: Friends and family of former President George H.W. Bush gathered in Texas on Wednesday to mark the first day of issue for the U.S. Postal Service stamp honoring him. The event was held on the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, where Bush’s presidential library is located. Bush died in Houston on Nov. 30 at the age of 94. Speakers at the event, which was held on what would have been Bush’s 95th birthday, talked about the 41st president’s prolific letter writing. His grandson Pierce Bush said his grandfather’s words, dreams and hopes live on through his letters. “His letters showed his unique ability to lift others up, just at the time they needed to be lifted,” he said. George H.W. Bush served as president from 1989 to 1993.\n\nUtah\n\nCapitol Reef National Park: Officials say vandals have etched an image of an eye onto a sandstone rock formation at Capitol Reef National Park. Park visitors reported the graffiti on the Temple of the Moon monolith in the remote Cathedral Valley on June 6. Park officials say the etching is more than 2 feet wide and about 1 1/ 2 feet tall. Officials are determining if the graffiti can be removed or hidden. Defacing national park structures is a federal crime punishable by jail time and fines. Park law enforcement officers are investigating the vandalism. Information on the crime can be called in or submitted on the National Park Service website.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State health insurance regulators are planning to tweak Medicaid rules so transgender youth no longer have to wait until age 21 to seek gender-affirming surgery. The changes are aimed at removing barriers for people seeking a suite of surgeries in order to alleviate gender dysphoria, a conflict between a person’s gender identity and physical gender, says Nissa James, policy director for the Department of Vermont Health Access. Gender-affirming surgeries covered by Medicaid include 16 types of genital surgery, as well as breast augmentation or mastectomy, a surgery that removes the whole breast. The changes would be “enormously positive” for transgender people, especially those in their late teens, says Dr. Rachel Inker, who runs the Transgender Health Clinic at the Community Health Centers of Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A state agency has issued permits for three new solar projects. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Wednesday that the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality has signed off on two new projects in Halifax County and one project in Orange County. Combined, the new projects are expected to generate more than 200 megawatts, or enough energy to power about 25,000 homes. Virginia has seen a dramatic increase in solar facilities in recent years, driven largely by large technology companies seeking carbon-free energy sources for data centers.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state says drivers won’t pay tolls to use the city’s downtown Highway 99 tunnel until this fall. The Seattle Times reports Washington State Department of Transportation toll spokeswoman Emily Glad said Wednesday that no specific date has been set. When the four-lane tunnel opened Feb. 4, the state intended to begin collecting money from drivers this summer. But if tolling started now, drivers would encounter even worse congestion on Alaskan Way, where demolition crews are taking down the Alaskan Way Viaduct, and on First Avenue, which is crowded with detouring buses that had used the viaduct. State lawmakers approved the tunnel in 2009 to replace the aging Alaskan Way Viaduct and now have required that tolls raise $200 million toward the $3.2 billion project.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A beekeeping garden has been added to the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center in hopes that it will help the building attain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports that the first urban beekeeping garden in the city was set up last week on the convention center’s balcony. Along with three beehives, the garden contains flowers and herbs. Assistant Director Jim Smith says it’s also a way to show the public how the center participates in sustainability efforts, as well as recycling and energy management. In its quest for certification, Director John Robertson says the facility is implementing a more efficient air conditioning system and reducing the amount of electric and water used.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWestfield: Izzle, Timon, Batman, River and Mars spent years confined inside a lab, their lives devoted to being tested for the benefit of human health. But these rhesus macaques have paid their dues and are now living in retirement – in larger enclosures that let them venture outside, eat lettuce and carrots, dip their fingers in colorful plastic pools, paint, and hang from pipes and tires – in relative quiet. More research labs are retiring primates to sanctuaries like Primates Inc., a 17-acre rural compound in central Wisconsin, where they can live their remaining years, according to the sanctuaries and researchers. For some monkeys, it’s their first time hanging out in the fresh air. There were approximately 110,000 primates in research facilities in 2017, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Eastern Shoshone Tribe has joined a growing list of municipalities and groups nationwide in suing the makers and distributers of prescription painkillers. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the tribe announced Tuesday it had filed a federal lawsuit against two dozen companies, claiming they used deceptive marketing to convince doctors to prescribe opioids for treatment of chronic pain. The tribe says the opioid crisis has caused substantial increases in child welfare and social service costs. The lawsuit notes the opioid crisis has disproportionately affected Native Americans. The lawsuit is similar to those filed by other Wyoming entities, including the city of Casper and the Northern Arapaho Tribe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/25/disappeared-ducky-ramen-rewards-dorothy-parker-news-around-states/118469094/", "title": "Disappeared ducky, ramen rewards: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The Alabama Stone has been at the center of a mystery since its discovery in 1817, but a local man with a passion for history believes he’s unraveled its biggest question. Many have speculated about the meaning of the number 1232 scratched into the rock along with a Latin inscription, calling it everything from an enigma to a hoax. “I started looking at it and wondered why they couldn’t figure out what this number is on this stone,” Ken Willis said. “That’s been disputed now for 200 years.” The words seem to read: “HISPAN ET IND REX,” roughly translated to “King of Spain and the Indies,” echoing words carved on Spanish coins. Willis believes the stone is likely both an indication of a land claim left when explorer Hernando de Soto passed through the area in 1540 and a mileage marker, with the oft-debated number an indication of how far the spot was from Spain. Willis credited his work as a bridge inspector for the Alabama Department of Transportation with giving him insight. In modern terms, 1,232 Spanish nautical leagues is almost exactly the distance from Spain to the point on the Black Warrior River where the marker was found. “I like to have fell out of my chair,” Willis said. “I couldn’t believe it. How could I, 200 years later, come up with it? It’s only because of GPS.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Additional programs have launched aimed at providing pandemic aid to Tlingit and Haida tribal members and to shareholders of an Alaska Native corporation whose shareholder base is of Tlingit and Haida descent. One of the programs, from the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, is offering up to $1,000 in aid to tribal members who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The other, from Goldbelt Inc., is making available up to $2,600 per shareholder. Shareholders must be U.S. citizens and be able to show a financial impact from the pandemic to be eligible, KTOO Public Media reports. Nathan Johnson recently applied for one of the $1,000 grants. He used to work seasonal jobs in Angoon, but the pandemic hit the economy there hard, and he moved to Juneau for work opportunities. Grandparents in Angoon have been looking after his three children, whom he wants to bring to Juneau. He has been working at a restaurant and saving for an apartment for his family. He said $1,000 would be a “big help,” and submitting his application felt like a “big mountain off his shoulders.” Funding for the Tlingit and Haida program comes from a federal recovery package passed by Congress earlier this year.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The delivery of a report on the 2020 vote count to state Senate Republicans was delayed yet again Monday after the Donald Trump supporter hired to lead the effort and several others involved contracted COVID-19 “and are quite sick,” the Senate GOP leader said. The unprecedented partisan review from Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consultant with no election experience, has so far taken more than double the expected 60 days. The report, commissioned by Senate Republicans and funded mostly by Trump allies promoting his unsupported election fraud narrative, will not immediately be made public. Rather, two senior Republican senators will review it along with lawyers and advisers to decide whether the findings are supported by evidence. Republican Senate President Karen Fann said anything lacking sufficient backing will be removed. Election experts have been highly critical of the review, which Fann launched late last year as Trump and his allies hunted unsuccessfully for reasons to block the Jan. 6 certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. Election experts say Cyber Ninjas and its subcontracts are biased and incompetent, and they’re using bizarre, ever-changing procedures that could not produce reliable results. Cyber Ninjas owner Doug Logan has spread false conspiracy theories about the election.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Attorneys for former reality TV star Josh Duggar have filed motions seeking to dismiss child pornography charges against him. The motions ask for the dismissal of the two charges and to suppress evidence in the case, including all statements Duggar made to investigators, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The documents, filed Friday, allege that prosecutors failed to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence and that the two acting secretaries of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at the time of the investigation weren’t properly appointed. The motions to suppress evidence say investigators took Duggar’s cellphone before he could call his lawyer and questioned him without his lawyer present. Duggar, who appeared in TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting,” was indicted in April on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography, some of which prosecutors said depicted sexual abuse of toddlers. He has pleaded not guilty. Duggar has been confined to the home of family friends who agreed to be his custodian during his release, and he is prohibited from using internet-accessible devices as he awaits trial. “19 Kids and Counting” was canceled following revelations that Duggar had molested four sisters and a babysitter. He also previously apologized for a pornography addiction and cheating on his wife.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe: An army of firefighters worked Tuesday to try to keep a huge wildfire from pushing toward Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake surrounded by resort communities straddling the California-Nevada state line. The Caldor Fire, growing explosively at times, has scorched about 184 square miles and destroyed at least 455 homes since breaking out Aug. 14 in the Sierra Nevada southwest of Lake Tahoe. Just 9% contained and a threat to more than 17,000 structures, the Caldor Fire has become the nation’s No. 1 priority for firefighting resources, said Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It is knocking on the door to the Lake Tahoe basin,” he said at a Monday briefing. “We have all efforts in place to keep it out of the basin, but we do need to also be aware that is a possibility based on the way the fires have been burning.” Porter said he personally did not believe the fire would get into the basin but could be proved wrong, given the extraordinary behavior of current fires, such as the 1,142-square-mile Dixie Fire to the north in the Sierra-Cascades region. “Mother Nature has taken over and taken fires like the Dixie to places that I never thought was possible,” he said. The Dixie Fire, burning for more than a month, was 41% contained after destroying at least 1,262 buildings.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Drones have become increasingly popular among outdoor hobbyists, prompting state wildlife officials to voice concerns about the stress the buzzing aircraft can cause wildlife, especially as fall hunting seasons begin and animals prepare for winter. The Federal Aviation Administration said there were 1.1 million small hobbyist drones in the U.S. in 2016, a number that is expected to triple to 3.5 million this year. Colorado Parks and Wildlife Field Services Assistant Director Heather Dugan said harassing wildlife with a drone is illegal. “The definition of harassment is causing any change in the behavior of the wildlife,” Dugan said in a news release. “So if the animal runs, if it changes direction, if it stops eating, that’s harassment. Any change in the animal is considered harassment and it’s illegal.” Use of drones is prohibited for hunting before, during or after outings in Colorado, Dugan said. “The bottom line is, if it’s related to a hunt in any way, you can’t do it,” Dugan said. “For scouting, locating, anything. If they fly before they take an animal, they’re illegal. If they use the drone to locate an animal they may have shot and wounded, they’re illegal.” Penalties for violating drone laws can range from $70 up to $125,000 if hunting purposes are involved, with equipment subject to seizure.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: A woman who had a package stolen from her front step discovered the culprit was a black bear. Kristin Levine, of Bristol, posted home surveillance video on Facebook on Monday showing the bear sauntering across her driveway with the Amazon package in its mouth. “Yea so if anyone sees an Amazon package in the Chippens Hill area with my name on it…feel free to bring it back?” Levine wrote in her post. She told NBC Connecticut she received an alert from her security system about five minutes after Amazon dropped off the package and was “taken aback because I wasn’t expecting anyone else in my driveway.” The bear, she said, ended up dropping off the parcel in a neighbor’s yard. It was apparently not interested in the contents: several rolls of toilet paper, she said. “It was hysterical, like I said. I knew nothing in there was going to be irreplaceable, so it was a fun afternoon for sure,” Levine said. Her post on Facebook received numerous comments, including from people comparing the ursine porch pirate to the bear from the Charmin toilet paper commercials.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Indian River School District Board of Education voted “no confidence” in Gov. John Carney’s mask mandate Monday night and voted to submit a petition asking for the emergency order to be reconsidered or revised. The no-confidence vote is a largely symbolic action. Indian River students will still have to wear masks this year. “We are trying to work within the rules that are set in front of us, and we’re speaking out as a board,” Board President Rodney Layfield said. “I think this was what we could do to exercise ... what little local control we have within our district.” The decision seemed to appease the 125 or so people who came to the meeting for the district that serves nearly 10,600 students. They cheered at the no-confidence vote, which came after many took the opportunity to comment in opposition to the mask requirement. The board twice extended the comment period to accommodate speakers. Carney announced Aug. 10 that everyone kindergarten-age and older in public and private schools and child care centers must wear face coverings indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The mandate is based on Aug. 5 guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but Indian River board member Charles Hattier said that “the governor is not following good science.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As refugees fleeing Afghanistan relocate to the U.S. capital region, a restaurant specializing in Afghan cuisine is trying to help those in need, WUSA-TV reports. Lapis, a Michelin-recognized bistro in D.C.’s Adams Morgan neighborhood, put out a call for donations on its Instagram page, asking anyone who wants to donate supplies to drop them off at the restaurant. “The outpour of love and support is just astonishing,” co-owner Fatima Popal said. “We are truly, truly humbled by not only the donations but the people who are coming through here.” She said many of the volunteers who are spending time in the basement of her family’s business donated items themselves. “We did it because we needed to do something, and we couldn’t sit idle,” Popal said. She said the support has been so overwhelming that keeping track of the number of volunteers and donated items has been hard. A neighbor even donated extra space to help store the donations, which will be delivered to families with the help of resettlement agencies. “It feels really good to me to be a part of the community and support the work they’re doing for our new community that’s immigrating here,” volunteer Miranda Beebe said. “I just knew it was a way we can all pull together and make sure the America we want them to know be represented that way.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Walt Disney World will now require union employees as well as non-union and salaried workers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to keep their jobs at the theme park. The deal was reached Monday with a union coalition, shortly after the Pfizer vaccine earned full Food and Drug Administration approval. It requires the workers to show proof of vaccination by Oct. 22 to remain employed, although they can request exemptions for medical or religious reasons, a union statement said. Any employee who doesn’t comply or request an exemption will be “separated from the company with a ‘yes’ rehire status,” according to the Service Trades Council Union. Before layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic, the coalition covered about 43,000 of 77,000 Disney World workers. Disney announced last month that all non-union hourly and salaried employees would be required to receive the vaccine within 60 days. The company also asked all employees who were working from home to show proof of vaccination before returning to work. The company will hold on-site inoculation events for employees over the next several weeks, the union statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: The board that oversees a park near Atlanta voted Monday for a new logo that excludes the park’s giant mountainside carving of Confederate leaders. It’s another change by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to address criticism of the park’s Confederate legacy and shore up its finances. The board voted in May to relocate Confederate flags from a busy walking trail up the side of the mountain and create a museum exhibit that acknowledges the site’s connection to the Ku Klux Klan. The previous logo included a picture of the famous carving of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gens. Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. The new logo includes an image of a lake inside the park and a side of the mountain where the carving isn’t visible. Critics have called on the board to remove the colossal sculpture from the mountain’s northern face. Completed in 1972, it measures 190 feet across and 90 feet tall. It is the largest Confederate monument ever crafted and has special protection in Georgia law. Work on the Stone Mountain sculpture languished until the state bought the mountain in 1958 for a park. Finishing the monument gained renewed urgency amid resistance from Georgia and other Southern states to the civil rights movement and efforts to end segregation. Today, the site markets itself as a family theme park.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor is asking visitors and residents to reduce travel to the islands to essential business only as the state struggles to control COVID-19. Gov. David Ige said Monday that he wants to curtail travel to Hawaii through the end of October. “It is a risky time to be traveling right now,” he said. He said restaurant capacity has been restricted, and there’s limited access to rental cars. Ige stopped short of a mandate, saying it’s a different time now than last year, when strict travel rules that required quarantining essentially shut down Hawaii’s tourism industry. “Last year in March, when I first asked for visitors to postpone travel to the islands, we saw a 60% reduction in the traffic to Hawaii,” Ige said. “And then, certainly, ordering the mandatory quarantine of all incoming visitors reduced travel to the islands by 99.5%, essentially 100% of travelers.” Things are different now with vaccines available and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying fully vaccinated people can travel domestically. Ige said he supports Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi’s announcement to restrict indoor gatherings to 10 people and outdoor gatherings to 25. Blangiardi said the rules taking effect Wednesday would apply to weddings and other events.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Supreme Court has rejected a new law designed to make it harder for voters to get initiatives on the ballot, saying the legislation was so restrictive that it violated a fundamental right under the state’s constitution. The ruling issued Monday was a win for Reclaim Idaho, a group that successfully sponsored a Medicaid expansion initiative three years ago and is now working to qualify an initiative for the ballot that aims to increase public education funding. Idaho Speaker of the House Scott Bedke said in a statement that members of the House Republican Caucus were disappointed by the ruling. He said the law would have increased voter involvement, “especially in the corners of the state too often forgotten by some.” Reclaim Idaho co-founder Luke Mayville said the ruling means thousands of Idaho residents are “breathing sighs of relief.” Passed earlier this year, the new law required signature-gatherers to get 6% of registered voters in each of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts within a short time span. Opponents said it made Idaho’s initiative process the toughest in the nation, rendering such efforts virtually impossible to achieve. But supporters said the law would protect people with less popular political opinions from being overrun by the majority.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A gunshot detection system that has cost the city tens of millions of dollars and is touted as a critical component of the police department’s effort to combat gun violence rarely produces evidence of gun-related crime, Chicago’s watchdog agency concluded. In a scathing report released Tuesday, the Office of Inspector General’s Public Safety section said the police department data it examined “does not support a conclusion that ShotSpotter is an effective tool in developing evidence of gun-related crime.” And, the office concluded, if the department has information that shows ShotSpotter plays a key role in developing such evidence, its “record-keeping practices are obstructing a meaningful analysis of the effectiveness of the technology.” The inspector general’s office found that between Jan. 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, just over 50,000 ShotSpotter alerts were confirmed as probable gunshots, but actual evidence of a gun-related crime was found in only about 4,500 instances, or roughly 9%. The report is the latest blow to a system that has come under scrutiny, particularly in Chicago, after it set in motion the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy last March. And an Associated Press review released last week found serious flaws in the use of ShotSpotter as evidentiary support for prosecutors.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A study by Early Learning Indiana sheds light on which areas across the state are lacking accessibility and availability of quality early childhood care and education. Only 25% of children in the state have access to high-quality preschool, it finds. The Closing the Gap report uses new methodology to analyze availability, accessibility and quality of early learning opportunities in each of Indiana’s 92 counties and highlights some disparities between the state’s urban centers and rural communities. Early Learning Indiana President and CEO Maureen Weber said it’s important for all Hoosiers, regardless of socioeconomic status, to have access to and take advantage of early learning opportunities. “We know that access to high-quality early learning services is truly foundational to a child’s success in kindergarten and beyond,” Weber said, “and also has great bearing on family self-sufficiency and community resiliency.” The goal of the study was to provide decision-makers with more than just an overall capacity count, Weber said – Early Learning Indiana wanted them to understand the nature of those seats, both their accessibility and availability.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: The Indianola School Board has tabled discussions about dumping the district’s Indian mascot to focus its attention on fighting the spread of coronavirus in school buildings. The board decided at a meeting Monday to postpone acting on any mascot changes until after the November election, in which at least three board seats will be decided at the polls. “This is not our priority,” school board member Carolyn Langenwalter said. “I’m not disagreeing that we should talk about it, but I think it’s something we delay until we get through the pandemic.” The board’s decision comes as schools, cities and athletic teams across the country are changing or reconsidering mascots considered to be culturally insensitive. Last year, the city of Indianola voted to remove Native American imagery from its city logo, including from police cars, badges and patches.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: People who oppose mask requirements or restrictions on public gatherings imposed by counties can challenge them in court and obtain a ruling within 10 days – at least for now – because of a decision Tuesday by the state’s highest court. The Kansas Supreme Court’s ruling could discourage counties from imposing mask mandates to deal with the two-month surge in coronavirus cases tied to the more contagious delta variant. It also could cause school boards to hesitate as well, though most of them are not directly affected. The court granted a stay allowing enforcement of the pandemic-inspired law until it can rule on Republican state Attorney General Derek Schmidt’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that declared the law unconstitutional. The GOP-led Legislature passed the law in March to restrict the power of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and county officials during emergencies. The Supreme Court’s order, signed by Chief Justice Marla Luckert, didn’t explain why it granted the stay, though it could indicate that the justices feel Schmidt’s appeal has merit. The state’s COVID-19 cases have been surging at levels not seen since late January, when vaccines still weren’t widely available, with 1,208 new cases per day for the seven-day period that ended Monday. Hospitals also have been stressed for weeks.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state is seeing record numbers of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and intensive care units as cases are driven up by the fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. More than 20 Kentucky hospitals are confronting critical staffing shortages, and some hospitals are converting space to treat the influx of ICU patients, the governor said. “Our hospitalizations have been doubling just about every two weeks,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. “And folks, that means we are getting really close to every single bed across the entire commonwealth that we can staff being full.” Some hospitals have begun delaying elective surgeries. Beshear presented grim statistics to show the severity of the surge. The state had 2,596 new COVID-19 cases – a pandemic high for any Monday in Kentucky – and 17 more virus-related deaths. More than 1,890 virus patients were reported hospitalized in Kentucky, including 529 in intensive care units, he said. A record 301 Kentucky virus patients were on ventilators. The surge comes as the Republican-dominated Legislature assumes considerably more control over the commonwealth’s response to COVID-19 after the state Supreme Court on Saturday cleared the way for laws limiting the governor’s emergency powers to take effect.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is considering which of three areas will become the first site dominated by a river delta in a federally sponsored network to protect, study and teach about estuaries. Nine virtual town hall meetings – three each about the Atchafalaya, Barataria and Pontchartrain basins – have been scheduled in September to tell people statewide about the program and hear their thoughts. Louisiana is among seven coastal states that are not part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System guided and largely paid for by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s the only Gulf Coast state without such a reserve, though variety is more important than state-by-state inclusion. And Louisiana’s will be unique, said Joelle Gore, stewardship division chief of NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management. There’s a small delta in Alaska’s 372,000-acre Kachemak Bay reserve, and Alabama’s Weeks Bay reserve is within the extensive Mississippi River delta region, she said Friday. But “the dominance of that system in Louisiana is unlike any other,” she said. Estuaries are brackish bodies of water usually found where rivers meet the sea.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: A 25-foot inflatable duck named Joy disappeared over the weekend, as mysteriously as it arrived, after bringing days of delight to a seaside community. The rubber ducky was removed from the harbor sometime Saturday, likely because of concerns about Tropical Storm Henri, Belfast Harbor Master Katherine Given told the Bangor Daily News. Despite the weather concerns, Given said, people were upset to see the duck leave the harbor. The duck’s arrival there two weekends ago remains a mystery. But Given said she received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be responsible. “JOY simply is fowl play. In this day in age of such bitter divisiveness in our country, we wanted to put forth a reminder of our commonalities instead of our differences,” the letter said. “Nothing embodies childhood more than being in a warm bath with your rubber ducky – the joy of not having a care in the world other than having to remember to wash behind our ears.” Will the ducky return? That’s not known – but the letter alluded to the duck landing somewhere else after Belfast.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: More than 200,000 residents have gained health insurance coverage during a coronavirus special enrollment period. Maryland Health Connection announced Tuesday that a total of 201,141 people had enrolled since March 2020. The 17-month special enrollment period in response to the pandemic was one of the longest of any state in the country. It was extended several times as the emergency continued and ended Aug. 15. Maryland Health Connection is administered by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. More than 1.3 million Marylanders are currently covered through Maryland Health Connection – about 1.2 million in Medicaid and more than 165,000 in private coverage, with nearly 80% qualifying for financial help. That’s up 12% compared to before the pandemic. The next opportunity for Marylanders to enroll in private health insurance through Maryland Health Connection will begin Nov. 1 for the 2022 coverage year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMalden: The state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education overwhelmingly approved a measure Tuesday that gives Education Commissioner Jeff Riley the authority to issue a universal mask mandate for K-12 schools. Riley is expected to formally issue an indoor mandate this week and has previously said it would last through Oct. 1, or for about the first month of the new school year. A mandate would mark a shift for the administration of Gov. Charlie Baker, which had previously left face covering decisions up to individual districts. “Ultimately, we believe that vaccinations will be the most important factor in bringing this pandemic to an end,” Riley said. “We know that a return this fall to full-time, in-person instruction is crucial. And after the challenges of last year, it will be incredibly important for this year to get off on a strong start.” He also said it is possible masks “may be required intermittently throughout the year based on the trajectory of the virus.” Students with certain medical conditions or behavioral needs would be exempt from the requirement. Students under age 5 would also be exempted. Under Riley’s plan, middle and high schools would be allowed to lift the mask mandate after Oct. 1 if at least 80% of staff and students were fully vaccinated.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Hundreds of students at the University of Michigan could be couch surfing when the new school year begins Monday. A developer admits that The One, a new apartment complex in Ann Arbor, is behind schedule and won’t be ready until September, MLive.com reports. Students have been offered a hotel room or cash stipend until their apartments are completed, said Damian VanMatre, vice president of development at Trinitas Ventures, based in Lafayette, Indiana. Students also can break their lease, he said. “Unfortunately, construction was shut down for months in 2020 due to the pandemic, and when construction restarted the general contractor struggled to recover from the delays due to material and product availability along with labor shortages – the same challenges faced by other contractors throughout the United States,” VanMatre said. Some students are complaining that they’ve been offered hotel rooms miles away in Livonia and Canton Township. “The timing overall has created immense mental anguish and stress for students during a notoriously difficult time in every student’s life,” said a letter by students.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFalcon Heights: About 150 vendors will be missing when the Minnesota State Fair returns this week from a one-year layoff due to the pandemic. Many pulled out due to COVID-19 fears, staffing shortages and product supply chain issues. That’s double the number of vendors that usually drop out compared with other recent years, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. “Yes, we did lose 150 vendors, but that’s over the past year,” fair spokeswoman Danielle Dullinger said, adding that only one was a food vendor. “I know a lot of state agencies are not able to come this year.” Those agencies include the Office of Higher Education, the Department of Education and the Department of Health. The Department of Natural Resources won’t open its building, but outdoor activities – including the popular fish pond, raptor demonstrations and performances on the outdoor stage – are still planned. On the bright side, Dullinger said, the fair will be adding 61 new vendors to the mix when it returns Thursday. Last week, fair officials announced that they would urge but not require fairgoers to wear masks and be vaccinated before entering. The decision ultimately did cause seven vendors to cancel, Dullinger said. One of those was Education Minnesota, with the teachers union citing “health and safety concerns.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: More than 1,000 out-of-state medical workers began to deploy to 50 hospitals across the state Tuesday to help with staffing shortages amid an unrelenting surge of COVID-19 cases. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said 808 nurses, three certified nurse anesthetists, 22 nurse practitioners, 193 respiratory therapists and 20 paramedics were hired under 60-day contracts that could be extended if needed. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency awarded contracts to four companies of the 19 that submitted bids when the state sought medical workers earlier this month. Reeves said the contract employees are being deployed within nine business days from when the state Health Department asked MEMA to seek the help. “That, in my view, is an impressive feat,” Reeves said during a news conference Tuesday. Mississippi will pay $80 million for the contracts, and Reeves said he expects the federal government to reimburse the state for the entire expense. The Army and the Air Force are also each deploying medical contingents to work in Mississippi, with 43 people from each branch. The Health Department on Tuesday reported 3,291 new cases of COVID-19 and 111 new deaths, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to at least 8,158 deaths and nearly 417,000 cases.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Civil rights leaders on Monday warned state lawmakers that attempts to ban critical race theory in schools could scare educators away from teaching about the Holocaust. Rabbis, teachers and others testified during an informational Joint Committee on Education hearing about critical race theory, a framework for examining the effects race and racism have on institutions. Dee Dee Simon, a member of the state’s Holocaust Education and Awareness Commission, said the board is worried that limits on how educators teach about race “would obstruct and/or hinder Holocaust education in the classroom.” “Would it make it illegal to tell students the truth, based on facts, that the Nazis were systematically unfair to the Jewish people?” she asked. “Would it make it illegal to say that the Nazis legislated the persecution of the Jews and that these were race laws?” Of 425 Missouri school districts, three said they used critical race theory or the New York Times’ 1619 Project in curricula, according to a July survey by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Missouri’s GOP-controlled Legislature is not in session, and no bills to ban critical race theory are pending. But Republican lawmakers filed long-shot proposals this year in a show of opposition to the theory.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Minerals Inc., accused of exposing employees to elevated levels of arsenic at its Anaconda facility, admitted Monday to violating the Clean Air Act, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In addition, the corporation has agreed to settle a related civil case regarding violations brought by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. U.S. Minerals pleaded guilty to one count of negligent endangerment, a misdemeanor, under the Clean Air Act as charged in a criminal information. The corporation faces a maximum penalty of five years of probation and a fine as determined through statute. Under the terms of a plea agreement in the criminal case, the government and U.S. Minerals will jointly recommend to the court that the company be placed on probation for five years and pay a $393,200 fine. The agreement recommends probationary conditions in which U.S. Minerals will implement a nationwide environmental health and safety plan that applies to all of its facilities throughout the United States and a medical monitoring program for current and former employees who have been exposed to elevated levels of arsenic during their work at the Anaconda plant, which has ceased operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nRalston: Students and staff at the middle school and high schools in an Omaha suburb are now required to wear masks following new cases of COVID-19 in the district, officials announced. Ralston Public Schools announced the change Sunday, saying the policy applies to staff members and students from seventh through 12th grades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Masking will be required through Sept. 16, when district officials will review the policy. Masks will be available at the schools for students who do not have them. Superintendent Mark Adler said in a letter to parents that the decision was made after three cases were identified in one classroom at the secondary level. The Ralston district was already requiring students in preschool through sixth grade, staff and visitors to wear masks. “It has been our goal from the beginning of this pandemic to find a way to keep our students in school,” Adler wrote. “Implementing this additional intervention will help us mitigate the spread and not keep students at home or close a classroom or school.” The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has sharply risen over the past two weeks from more than 374 new cases per day Aug. 7 to nearly 728 new cases per day Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: It’s all aboard the Virginia & Truckee Railway this weekend – with masks mandatory – for the first time in 18 months on the historic Engine No. 18 and passenger cars offering round-trip rides from Carson City to Virginia City. The V&T Railway typically operates in the summer months and during the December holiday season with a special schedule and Santa Clause on the Polar Express. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced its closure before the 2020 summer season began. Service returns Saturday with an opening ceremony at Eastgate Depot in Carson City. It will run Saturdays and Sundays through Oct. 31, followed by the return of the Polar Express this winter. “We’re very fortunate that our loyal supporters have been patient and persistent in supporting us through this last season,” V&T Commission Chairman David Peterson said Friday. “We can’t wait to get going again.” The train offers scenic views of the Virginia Mountain range on the way to the historic mining town, along with abandoned mine shafts, old mill sites and sometimes free-roaming mustangs. Ticket prices range from $55 for adults to $35 for children ages 2 to 15. Masks are required aboard the train and inside Eastgate Depot.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHancock: The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire is expanding beyond Portsmouth. The Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail got its start more than 20 years ago and now includes two dozen markers that shed light on the city’s Black history. Now a statewide organization, the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire plans to unveil markers this fall in Hancock, Milford, Warner and several other communities. The first unveiling is set for Sept. 18 in Hancock. The marker will describe Jack, a once-enslaved African man who gained his freedom and lived there in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It also will describe the Due family, free people of color who lived around the same time. The marker is at the site of their former home on property now owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. After the unveiling at 9:30 a.m., a noon celebratory program with music and food is scheduled at the Hancock Congregational Church. Preregistration for the Sept. 18 event in Hancock is required, and space is limited.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBranchburg: Hazing will be met with harsher penalties under a new law named after Tim Piazza, a New Jersey native and Penn State student who died in 2017. Gov. Phil Murphy signed Timothy J. Piazza’s Law on Tuesday at Raritan Valley Community College, not far from where Piazza, who died when he was a 19-year-old sophomore studying engineering, grew up. Pennsylvania also enacted tougher anti-hazing laws in 2018 that permit fraternity houses to be confiscated when severe hazing occurs. “The safety of our students is our top priority, and we must do all that we can to protect them from cruel and dangerous hazing rituals,” said Murphy, a Democrat. “With today’s bill signing, we honor Tim Piazza’s life and make our strongest effort yet to root out hazing to prevent similar tragedies.” The measure requires all public and private middle and high schools, as well as colleges and universities, to draw up anti-hazing policies, along with penalties for violations that could include withholding of a diploma, suspension or expulsion. The new law also establishes that hazing resulting in serious injury or death will be considered a third-degree crime, up from fourth-degree. A conviction will carry a prison sentence of up to five years, a fine as high as $15,000 or both, vs. up to 18 months, a $10,000 fine or both.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Drone pilots beware. Authorities at one of the nation’s top nuclear weapons laboratories issued a warning Monday that airspace over Los Alamos National Laboratory is off limits. The birthplace of the atomic bomb, Los Alamos lab reported that recent unauthorized drone flights have been detected in restricted airspace in the area. Officials said anyone who flies a drone over the lab likely will lose it. “We can detect and track a UAS (unmanned aircraft system), and if it poses a threat, we have the ability to disrupt control of the system, seize or exercise control, confiscate or use reasonable force to disable, damage or destroy the UAS,” said Unica Viramontes, senior director of lab security. The lab would not release any specifics about how the system works, citing security protocols. They also would not say how many unauthorized flights have occurred in recent months. Lab officials warned of the potential for “collateral interceptions” of normal commercial or hobbyist drone flights, saying pilots should stay well outside the lab’s restricted airspace and the additional no-drone zone designated by the Federal Aviation Administration. According to the FAA, drones are prohibited from flying over sites designated as national security sensitive facilities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dorothy Parker died in 1967, but it was not until last year that her ashes found a final resting place. Now, at a memorial ceremony at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, her headstone has been unveiled at the family plot where ashes of the writer, humorist and civil rights supporter are buried, the New York Post reports. Born in 1893 in New York, Parker wrote poems, short stories, and theater and literary reviews for magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. She was famous for one-liners such as, “The first thing I do in the morning is brush my teeth and sharpen my tongue,” and “Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.” She died without leaving instructions on what to do with her remains but left her estate, along with the right to collect future royalties, to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whom she’d never met. When King was assassinated, her estate transferred to the NAACP, which laid her ashes to rest in a garden outside its Baltimore headquarters in 1988. Before that, her remains had been held for years at a crematorium and in an attorney’s filing cabinet. Parker’s relatives attended Monday’s memorial, where those gathered read from Parker’s work and some poured gin, her beverage of choice, on the grave. The headstone is carved with words from a poem Parker wrote in 1925: “Leave for her a red young rose; Go your way, and save your pity; She is happy, for she knows that her dust is very pretty.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation Monday that would slightly rework the state panel that recommends whether charter schools can open or should be shuttered. Currently, two of the 11 voting members of the Charter Schools Advisory Board are chosen by the State Board of Education. The governor picks nearly all voting positions on the State Board of Education. The bill would have given the education board just one spot to fill, while the superintendent of public instruction or her designate would receive another voting position. Currently the superintendent or her designate is a nonvoting member to the advisory board, which also recommends rules on how charter schools should operate or be monitored. “The State Board of Education is constitutionally and statutorily charged with administering children’s education in state public schools, including charter schools,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. “It is critical that the board have both of their appointments to the (charter schools) board to carry out its constitutional duties.” Both the House and Senate approved the bill by what would be veto-proof majorities, so an override is possible. But Cooper, a Democrat, has been known to consolidate his support before override attempts by Republican legislative leaders.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife managers are encouraging hunters to take advantage of electronic map tools that can help them identify private land before they venture onto it. Map resources, mobile apps and printable maps can be found on the Game and Fish Department’s website, at gf.nd.gov. “Each have different strengths, such as some require cell service, while others can work offline; others offer the ability to determine who posted the land or a point of contact,” said Brian Hosek, business operations manager. “And you can still pull down that print material for those who do not prefer to use these technologies.” The Legislature passed a law this year making electronic posting equal to physical posting and penalties, as well as defining a fence. It also allows only lawful hunters and anglers to access fenced, unposted land, for hunting and fishing activities only, the Bismarck Tribune reports. About 7,000 landowners have posted 3.75 million acres – about 8.3% of North Dakota’s land area. Penalties for violating the new law include a $250 noncriminal offense for hunters, anglers and others trespassing on posted land, along with misdemeanors for more serious trespassing scenarios, such as property damage or refusing to leave.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A piece of metal that flew off the world’s second-tallest roller coaster and hit a woman in the head while she stood in line came from the back of the ride’s train and was about the size of a fist, an amusement ride safety official said Monday. It’s not known yet what caused the accident a week ago on the 420-foot-tall Top Thrill Dragster roller coaster at Cedar Point, said David Miran, head of Ohio’s amusement ride safety division. Authorities and amusement park officials have not released the condition of the victim, who is a 44-year-old woman from Swartz Creek, Michigan, according to an accident report released by the state. She could be heard screaming on body camera footage released by police. She was treated at a hospital near the park in Sandusky before being moved to a hospital in Toledo. The metal L-shaped bracket that hit the woman Aug. 15 was attached to the back of the train and hovers above the track, Miran said. It’s part of the sensor system that tells the coaster’s computer where the train is on the track, he said. The coaster train was nearing the end of the ride where it slows down when the metal plate broke, park officials said. It’s not clear how far the piece flew before hitting the woman, Miran said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Attorney General John O’Connor has filed more petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court asking justices to overturn last year’s ruling that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservation still exists. One petition was filed in the case of former Tulsa police Officer Shannon Kepler, whose state manslaughter conviction was reversed because he is a member of the Muscogee Nation, and the crime occurred on the tribe’s reservation. Other petitions challenge reversals of convictions of first-degree murder and child abuse. “As a result of the McGirt decision, many convictions were vacated, and some were dismissed,” a spokesman for O’Connor said. “We are appealing these cases to try to reinstate these convictions and re-apprehend these criminals.” The state now has at least five petitions pending before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the McGirt decision, which has reshaped criminal jurisdiction in most of eastern Oklahoma. In all five cases at issue in the petitions, U.S. attorneys offices in Oklahoma have filed federal charges. In Kepler’s case, federal prosecutors in Tulsa have already tried and obtained convictions. In the case of convicted murderer Jordan Batice Mitchell, federal prosecutors in Tulsa secured a plea deal for second-degree murder in Indian Country.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Two new laws aimed at expanding voter access are under fire from a conservative group that argues the changes will make state elections less secure. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports people affiliated with the group Oregonians for Fair Elections have filed referendum petitions that, if successful, would ask voters to approve or reject the new laws next year. To do that, they’d need to collect 74,680 valid signatures in opposition to each bill by Sept. 24, a tight timeline that could be hard to meet as the state struggles with a resurgence of COVID-19. The first, House Bill 2681, ensured that voters cannot be labeled “inactive” – and so ineligible to automatically receive a ballot – for the sole reason of not voting. It’s an extension of other steps Oregon has taken in recent years. The second bill targeted for reversal, House Bill 3291, implemented a change, already in practice in other vote-by-mail states, that will allow mailed ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and reach officials within a week of the election. Ballots in Oregon have traditionally only been accepted if they are received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Inmates in state prisons will be counted in their home districts and not where their prisons are located after a divided vote Tuesday by the five-member panel redrawing legislative district maps this year. The Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission voted 3-2 for the policy change that was introduced by House Minority Leader Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia. “We cannot wait another 10 years. The time to correct this injustice is now,” she said. The vote changes the long-standing policy of counting inmates toward state House and Senate districts where their state prisons are located. The House and Senate Republican leaders voted against the change, while McClinton was joined by the Senate Democratic floor leader and by the commission’s chair, former University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. Appointed by the Democratic-majority state Supreme Court as the commission’s swing vote, Nordenberg said that for months he “did not think I would be where I am today” but had kept an open mind. “When a system holds and counts a person in one place but forces him or her to vote in another, it does create a basic issue of fairness,” he said. But counting inmates in their prison’s legislative districts “distorts the reapportionment process.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s largest health care organization announced Tuesday that it is amending its visitor policy at hospitals and ambulatory care centers in response to an increase in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Lifespan is now limiting the number of visitors per patient, along with the number of family members or escorts during an emergency intake. Patients in most settings will be allowed a single visitor at a time, up to a limit of two throughout the duration of their stay. Some visitor policies remain unchanged, including exceptions for end-of-life care patients, with two visitors for pediatric patients. Masks are required. Lifespan said it “understands this is difficult for patients and their loved ones, but such measures are necessary to help protect their health and safety as well as that of our health care workers and the general public during the ongoing pandemic.” Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Miriam, Bradley and Newport hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A noncommissioned Army officer depicted in a viral video accosting and shoving a man has been convicted of third-degree assault. A magistrate judge found Fort Jackson Army Sgt. Jonathan Pentland guilty of the misdemeanor Monday after a two-day trial, news outlets report. He will have to choose between 30 days in jail or a fine of $1,087. Pentland was suspended from his post prior to the trial. Pentland, 42, is white, and the man shoved is Black. The video of part of their confrontation became a racial flashpoint when it was posted to Facebook in April after Pentland screamed: “You’re in the wrong neighborhood.” But race was never mentioned during Pentland’s trial in Columbia. Pentland testified that he was trying to protect his family from a man acting strangely. The man he shoved, 22-year-old Deandre Williams, said he was trying to avoid a confrontation. “As a young man, if I go on a walk, I shouldn’t feel any form of pressure,” Williams said after the verdict. Prosecutor Paul Walton said Pentland broke the law three times: when he shoved Williams before the video started, again as Williams took an awkward step toward Pentland’s wife, and then when he slapped Williams’ phone out of his hand. “His pride is hurt,” Walton said of Pentland. “He’s a drill sergeant, and he’s used to people doing what he says.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Even as coronavirus numbers climb, lawmakers have tried to pressure Gov. Kristi Noem to call a special session to pass a ban on employers requiring COVID-19 vaccinations. Several Republicans in the state House of Representatives have circulated drafts of bills that would stop employers from mandating vaccinations, stepping up pressure on Noem to call a special session for them to approve the bills. But she has resisted those calls, saying there is not widespread support for a special session. The issue has Noem, who has carved out a nationwide following for her hands-off approach to the virus, being pushed from the right to intervene on the state’s largest employer, Sanford Health. House Speaker Spencer Gosch said late Friday that he wanted the governor to call a special session as he released a draft of a bill that would make COVID-19 vaccination status “strictly confidential medical information” that would be off-limits to employers. The state’s largest employer, Sanford Health, plans to require all employees to get a shot by Nov. 1. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury cast Noem’s resistance to the idea as keeping with her conservative approach to the pandemic and argued that government should not be dictating whether employers require vaccinations for their workers.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state surpassed 1million coronavirus infections Tuesday as COVID-19 conquers the state again, filling hospitals and spreading rapidly among the unvaccinated and school-age children. The Tennessee Department of Health is currently reporting nearly 6,400 new infections per day. Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he never initially expected Tennessee to reach 1 million infections. But coronavirus has proven a “nasty, resistant virus,” and he underestimated how resistant politicians, community leaders and the general public would be to necessary efforts to slow and stop the virus. “It was a sobering realization that we have had so many people infected and, as a consequence, so many people having to suffer hospitalization, severe disease and loss of life,” Schaffner said. “Much of that could have been prevented.” Almost all of Tennessee’s recent infections are among those who have chosen to remain unvaccinated or are too young to be eligible. Ninety percent of all new infections in May, June and July were among unvaccinated populations, according to a recent virus report from the Tennessee Department of Health. Only 41% of residents are fully inoculated – the ninth-lowest rate of all U.S. states, federal data shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican legislators brought back their voting bill Monday with no changes as some Democrats returned to the state Capitol for the first time since ending their holdout, making it clear that the bill is on track to become law after their 38-day walkout. Dozens of people showed up to testify before lawmakers to seize their last chance for public input on the bill that would tighten voting rules in ways the GOP says will ensure election integrity and that Democrats say amounts to voter suppression for disabled people and minorities. Senate Bill 1 would make mail voting a stricter process, increase liberties for poll watchers, and prohibit 24-hour and drive-thru voting, two ways Harris County – which includes Houston and where 44% of the nearly 5 million residents are Latino and 20% are Black – expanded options for voters and also offered protections against the coronavirus. Candis Houston, who lives in Houston, said she arrived in Austin on Sunday night so she could show up early Monday to testify. She joined about 70 other people who arrived at the Capitol as the sun was rising. “I had ancestors that died and marched for the privilege for us to vote, and anytime I can participate, I am going to be there,” said Houston, who is Black. “We should be encouraging people to vote and not limiting them.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Researchers are planning to use ground-penetrating radar at the site of a former Indigenous boarding school in southern Utah where tribal leaders say there may be unmarked graves. Tribal leaders and historians say there may be at least a dozen Paiute children buried in unmarked graves on school grounds near Panguitch, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Corrina Bow, chairwoman for the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, said boarding school officials would take children as young as 6 and force them to work at a farm on the property. “We were informed that there were bodies buried over there,” Bow said. “But we are not sure until someone comes in and verifies it.” Utah State University, which leases the site from the state, plans to survey and map the grounds before conducting radar scanning. The school’s anthropology department also said it would be willing to excavate the site if the tribe wanted. The recent discovery of children’s remains buried at the site of what was once Canada’s largest Indigenous residential school has magnified interest in the troubling legacy in both Canada and the United States. In June, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced that the United States will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s high vaccination rate against COVID-19 gives it great latitude in coping with the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the delta variant, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. Scott said he felt people should wear masks in crowded indoor settings among unfamiliar people, but he is not going to issue a formal recommendation or reimpose the state of emergency that would him authorize him to order mask usage. “We are asking Vermonters to use common sense, to be vigilant, to get your vaccinations and continue to use your head and assess your own situation and do the right thing,” Scott said. The rate of growth in new cases of COVID-19 has been slowing, and state experts predict they could begin falling again within the next few weeks. If things change, Scott said, he would be willing to change as well. “Am I concerned about what I am seeing? Of course I am,” Scott said during his weekly virus briefing. “We are ready to pivot, we are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep Vermonters safe when we have to.” But he said he didn’t believe additional recommendations are needed at this time.\n\nVirginia\n\nKing George: Dozens of headstones from a historic African American cemetery in the nation’s capital that were used as erosion control along the Virginia shoreline of the Potomac River are being relocated to a memorial garden in Maryland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser attended a ceremony in Caledon State Park in King George on Monday to mark the transfer of the first 55 headstones from Virginia to Maryland, officials said. The grave markers will be part of a memorial garden at National Harmony Memorial Park in Prince George’s County honoring the 37,000 people buried at the original cemetery. The Columbian Harmony Cemetery was established in 1859 and was the most prominent burial site for African Americans in Washington, but it was moved in the 1960s to make room for development. Remains were moved to a memorial garden in Maryland, but the gravestones were sold or given away, officials said. Prominent people buried at the original cemetery include Elizabeth Keckly, a former slave who became a seamstress and trusted confidante of first lady Mary Todd Lincoln; Osborne Perry Anderson, the only African American survivor of John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry; Mary Ann Shadd Cary, America’s first African American female newspaper editor; and Philip Reid, a foundry worker who helped build of the Statue of Freedom at the U.S. Capitol, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nKennewick: Staff at a jail in south-central Washington have come up with an inexpensive but effective way to encourage inmates to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the first of the month, the Benton County Jail has been giving away one of its most popular commissary items – ramen noodles – to inmates who sign up for their first COVID-19 shot, the Olympian reports. By Monday, the jail had given out 900 packets of noodle soup to 90 inmates, said Scott Souza, chief of corrections for the Benton County Corrections Department. It’s advertised to inmates around the jail with fliers featuring a larger-than-life photo of the seasoned, wavy noodles and a headline that says: “SOUPS FOR SHOTS.” “To encourage and support COVID vaccination efforts, the Benton County Department of Corrections will be providing each inmate that starts their vaccination series with 10 FREE RAMEN NOODLE SOUPS!!!” say posters around the jail in Kennewick. “We’re doing everything we can do to incentivize vaccination, and we are getting outstanding response,” Souza said. Any inmate, no matter how long their stay, is eligible for the program if they have not yet been immunized. The Benton County jail has shared information about the program with other jails in the state, Souza said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice won’t be moonlighting as the coach of a boys high school basketball team where he already is the girls coach. The Greenbrier County Board of Education on Monday rejected a motion to hire Justice as the boys coach at Greenbrier East High School. News outlets report the board voted 3-2 to toss a recommendation from county schools Superintendent Jeff Bryant to hire Justice. The Republican governor said during one of his regularly scheduled news conferences on the coronavirus pandemic that the board’s vote “came down with just that ugliness of personal preference or political preference. ... Frankly, the board of education in Greenbrier County made a decision that will ultimately hurt not me but the kids.” The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. Much of the debate involved whether Justice could give enough attention to both the boys and girls teams while also being governor, along with paying attention to his family’s businesses. Board member Rick Parker, who voted against Justice’s hiring, had said he planned to base his vote on those concerns. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024. Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson pushed back Tuesday against Republican lawmakers who claim campuses need their permission to implement COVID-19 policies. Thompson insisted university leaders don’t need legislative approval to manage the schools – a major break from his party’s stance against pandemic protocols. A key Republican lawmaker promised to pursue a lawsuit. But Thompson, a former GOP governor who served as health secretary under President George W. Bush, said he would not cede control of the system to fellow Republicans who run the Legislature. “I’m not going to be intimidated,” he told reporters during a briefing. “Even though I don’t want to pick a fight with the Legislature, I’m going to stand my ground. I’ve kept politics out of (running UW), and everyone agrees with that. I’m still a strong Republican. I just put my Republican bonafides aside when I run the university. I’ve got the right and the authority and the responsibility to do what’s necessary to keep the universities open.” Thompson has called for UW campuses to hold at least 75% of their classes in person this fall. The schools have implemented a range of protocols in recent weeks to meet that goal, including mask and coronavirus testing mandates. The system hasn’t required vaccinations. Thompson instead has created incentives for shots such as tuition remission. He said Tuesday, though, that he may have to “do an audible at the line” if infections keep climbing.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A judge who writes thrillers in his free time is putting out his third novel this fall after receiving a strong reception for the first two. The last nine months have moved quickly for Paul Phillips, the Gillette News Record reports. A Circuit Court judge by day, he has a lot on his docket from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. But he’s also been writing a series of thrillers under the pen name James Chandler. His first book, “Misjudged,” was published Nov. 10. He spent about four years working on it before he got it published. His second novel, “One and Done,” came out in February. And the just-finished “False Evidence” is scheduled to be released Oct. 12. All three books center on Sam Johnstone, a veteran who takes a job at a law firm in a small Wyoming town hoping for a fresh start. The audiobook version of his first novel was just released last week, read by James Anderson Foster, an award-winning narrator. He said he’s been “pleasantly surprised” by the reception his books have received. Combined, his first two books have more than 8,600 reviews on Amazon. The first book has more than 5,500 reviews and an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars, while the second book has about 3,200 reviews and a 4.4 rating.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/25"}]}

And the Teamsters have for the past two decades supported every major Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nThis year, their decision broke with much of the rest of the labor movement. Most other major unions – from the United Auto Workers, to the United Steelworkers and the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor groups in the U.S. – have endorsed Harris. Internal polling from the Teamsters' members shows that the members weren't quick to back Harris despite a majority backing Biden, leading some experts question whether race and gender have played a role in the decision.\n\nSo, what makes the Teamsters different from their brother and sister organizations?\n\nTheir members\n\nThe Teamsters 1.3 million members come from all walks of life – they’re truck drivers, freight workers, airline pilots, zookeepers and public defenders. They represent a cross-section of American workers, just like other unions.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe United Steelworkers, who quickly endorsed Harris after Biden dropped out of the election, has 1.2 million members and retirees in a wide array of industries – from health care and higher education to mining and metal. A number of members are also from manufacturing and heavy industrial sectors such as paper and forestry, rubber and tire, oil and petroleum, glass and chemicals.\n\nThe International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which also endorsed Harris, represents workers in electrical construction, transmission, utilities, manufacturing, broadcast, telecommunications, railroad and government. It also endorsed Harris.\n\nBut the Teamsters appear to be more divided than those organizations.\n\nTheir poll showed that a majority of members, roughly 60%, supported Trump, while some 34% supported Harris.\n\nPrior to the national organizations announcement on Wednesday, 10 local Teamsters unions had backed Harris, including one in Philadelphia – a city which Harris views as vital to her path to the presidency.\n\nTeamsters Joint Councils 7 and 42, which includes 300,000 members in California, Nevada, Hawaii and Guam, endorsed Harris shortly after the national union's announcement on Wednesday. Other local chapters in major swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania also endorsed Harris.\n\nCompare that to the AFL-CIO, whose 60 partner unions unanimously voted in July to support Harris for president. Much like the Teamsters, those unions represent a large swath of industries. The largest share of its members come from public-service organizations including the American Federation of Teachers and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, but it also represents firefighters, electricians and construction workers.\n\nPaul Clark, professor of labor and employment relations at Pennsylvania State University, said the Teamsters’ leaders had to be careful with the position they took because of how much support there was for Trump. Although the Teamsters’ has supported mostly Democrats in recent years, Clark noted that union members are not a monolith in who they vote for and what party they support.\n\n“That's really the reason for this non endorsement,” Clark said. He added that Sean O'Brien, president of the Teamsters, is also walking a “tight line” to maintain support from members when it comes down to his own reelection.\n\nPolitical history\n\nWhile the Teamsters have endorsed most Democratic presidential candidates since 2000, they’re allegiance with the Democratic Party tends to be less strong than other major unions.\n\nIn the late 20th Century, they often backed Republican contenders, including former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. And this year isn’t the first time they’ve declined to endorse a candidate. They bowed out of the 1996 election between former President Bill Clinton and Bob Dole and the 1976 campaign between former President’s Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, too.\n\nKate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research and a Senior Lecturer at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, suggested that the union’s shifts represent its political pragmatism. They’ll support the candidate they believe will advance their priorities, rather than be beholden to tradition.\n\n“Whatever is good for the union matters more than the politics,” Bronfenbrenner said.\n\nIn a sign of those political shifts, O’Brien earlier this year became the first president of the Teamsters in the organization’s 121-year history to speak at the Republican National Convention.\n\nO’Brien told the crowd that the Teamsters were “not beholden to anyone or any party,\" and only cared about one question: “What are you doing to help American workers?”\n\nMore workers in the Teamsters believe Trump is doing more to help them. And Clark, the Pennsylvania State University professor, believes O’Brien’s aim at the RNC and with the endorsement decision was to “send a message to those of his members that support Donald Trump, that he hears them.”\n\nEducating members\n\nThe Teamsters’ bottom-up approach to the 2024 election also differs from that of other unions, according to experts USA TODAY spoke with.\n\nO’Brien earlier this week noted that the “voices and opinions” of the union's members were helping guide its decision-making about an endorsement.\n\nAnd the message from those members has shifted substantially since the start of the race.\n\nPrior to Biden dropping out of the 2024 race, 44.3% of Teamsters members supported the president, according to straw poll results released by the Teamsters. Trump was at 36.3% in the straw poll.\n\nThose results flipped, and turned even more in favor of Trump, once Harris was at the top of the ticket. Results from an electronic member poll showed that Trump has the backing of 59.6% of Teamsters members, compared to Harris’ 34%. In a research phone call from Teamsters, the numbers were similar, with 31% saying they support Harris and 58% said they support Trump.\n\nBronfenbrenner argued that the key difference in support for Biden and Harris was about “gender and race.”\n\nGiven the Teamsters history representing truck drivers and warehouse workers, Clark said it does have a reputation of having a higher percentage of male members and being perceived as a “macho union.” Other groups, like the Service Employees International Union, which is more than half women and more than 40% non-white – have demographics that lean Democratic.\n\nThat could be one reason why there was less support for Harris among Teamsters.\n\nBut more likely, Clark said members probably just don’t know Harris as much as they did Biden.\n\n“She doesn't have quite the union credentials, the long record of support for unions that Biden has,” Clark said, adding that she’s made it clear in all her statements that she’s taking the same approach on unions as Biden did.\n\nWhere other unions have sought to educate their members about the policy platforms of Harris and Trump, the Teamsters have let their members lead the way.\n\nAFL-CIO spokesperson Mia Jacobs, for instance, said that the organization has also polled its members and found that a majority are firmly behind Harris.

Trump, on the other hand, would not commit to vetoing a national \"right-to-work\" law, the union said in a statement, which it called a \"red line for the Teamsters.\"\n\nBut neither candidate in their interviews, according to Teamsters, agreed not to intervene in labor disputes under the Railway Labor Act, which gives Congress the authority to set contracts in the rail and airline industries. To avert a freight rail shutdown in 2022, Congress approved a new contract for rail workers that lacked support of Teamsters' members.\n\n\"We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries ‐ and to honor our members’ right to strike – but were unable to secure those pledges,\" O'Brien said.\n\nMore:Harris leads Trump in Pennsylvania — and two bellwether PA counties — exclusive poll finds\n\nTeamsters' rank-and-file members support Trump, polls find\n\nTrump has courted the backing of rank-and-file union members – even if he lacks the endorsement of their unions – as he looks to match the working-class coalition that won him the 2016 election.\n\nAhead of its announcement, Teamsters released internal polling data of members that found the majority of them back Trump over Harris, even as leaders of other unions have widely backed the vice president.\n\nIn a phone survey of Teamsters members taken last week, 58% said they support Trump and 31% said they back Harris. An electronic survey taken over the summer found a similar 60-34% margin in favor of Trump.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee, a Teamsters straw poll taken in the spring and summer found rank-and-file members backed Biden 44%-37% over Trump, according to the union.

Earlier Tuesday, two Democratic sources confirmed the visit on condition of anonymity because the event, which was expected to be coordinated by Biden's reelection campaign, hadn't been made public.\n\nThe fact that Biden was expected to make the trip indicated a desire on the campaign's part to make the most out of last week's UAW endorsement and underscored recent indications that the president's likely opponent in this year's presidential race, former President Donald Trump, had made inroads with working class voters in Michigan and some other swing states.\n\nEver since the UAW announced its endorsement of Biden last week, Trump has been publicly sparring with the union's president, Shawn Fain, who has just as gamely fought back with criticism of the former president.\n\nAlso last Friday, Biden campaign officials were in southeastern Michigan to meet with leaders of some groups, including the large Arab-American community centered in and around Dearborn, where many voters have been angry about Biden's refusal so far to demand a cease-fire in Israel's war on Hamas following the group's attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7.

The latter, on Tuesday afternoon, said a final decision had not yet been made by the White House regarding the visit.\n\nOn Jan. 24, Fain announced the labor union's endorsement of Biden while issuing a stinging rebuke of Trump, calling Trump a \"scab\" and an enemy to working people.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, who has long characterized himself as a car enthusiast and a staunch supporter of labor, was believed to make history last September when he became the first sitting president to walk a picket line, visiting a Wayne County site as the UAW struck all Detroit Three automakers: General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, which was formerly Chrysler.\n\nFrom the beginning of that strike, which was ultimately successful in securing better wages, benefits and job protections for UAW workers facing an industrywide switch to making more electric vehicles, or EVs, Biden had aligned himself with the union cause, saying that record profits for automakers should translate to better wages for autoworkers.\n\nThough Fain and the UAW didn't provide their endorsement of Biden at the time — and held out for some months unlike other major unions, saying whoever received their endorsement must earn it — it ultimately came last week, with Fain calling Trump a member of the \"billionaire class\" that only seeks to divide workers. He also alluded to the fact that while some union members may want to support Trump or avoid the election altogether, the union should be united behind Biden, given his commitment to workers' rights.\n\n\"I know there's some people who want to ignore this election, they don’t want anything to do with politics,\" he said. \"(But) Elections aren’t just about picking … the candidate who makes you feel good. Elections are about power.\"\n\nFollowing that speech, Trump — who had visited a nonunion auto plant during the strike, saying little about the UAW's demands for better wages and benefits but saying they meant nothing unless the union leaders demanded the Biden administration abandon an agenda that encouraged, if not mandated, EV adoption — attacked Fain, calling him \"a dope.\"\n\nOn Monday on social media, Trump also called Fain \"a weapon of mass destruction\" on autoworkers. Fain, meanwhile, continued a round of media hits blasting Trump, on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Tuesday criticizing him for passing tax breaks that helped wealthier Americans more than middle-class ones and remaining largely silent during a 2019 strike, \"It's a real clear picture,\" Fain said. \"Donald Trump did not stand with working class people.\"\n\nThat working class vote and how it breaks in this year's election could be a key for either candidate in the industrial Midwest and Michigan, specifically, where Trump won the 2016 election by two-tenths of a percentage point and where Biden fought back against the then-incumbent president and won by just under 3 percentage points.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released.

Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream. There are so many photos of the president enjoying the classic summer dessert.\n\nThe president's connection to the delightful treat continued Sunday.

Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nJohnson said Biden’s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump “invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.”\n\n“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,” he said. “As second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice — not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a “patriotic American who has always put his nation first.”\n\n“His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in “best interest” of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden’s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the “best interest of the country and party,” in a statement Sunday.\n\n“President Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,” Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“Now it’s time for our nation to come together,” Beshear added in the post. “We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., issued a statement that praised Biden's accomplishments as president but did not address whether Harris should be the nominee. \"America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful,\" he said.\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nDNC chair says Democrats will launch process of choosing new candidate\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in the coming days Democrats will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”\n\nHarrison said the process will be “governed by established rules and procedures of the Party.”\n\n“Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,” Harrison said, adding that the American people will hear “in short order” from the Democratic Party on the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nThe DNC convention is set for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago, but Democratic National Committee leaders have planned for a virtual roll-call vote before Aug. 7 to satisfy concerns with ballot deadlines in several states.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nJosh Shapiro calls Biden a 'patriot'\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hailed Joe Biden as a “patriot” and commended his work as president in a social media post on Sunday shortly after the president announced he was dropping out of the 2024 race.“President Biden has gotten an incredible amount done to move our country forward, defend our democracy, and protect real freedom,” Shapiro wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Shapiro has been floated as a potential Democratic presidential nominee to replace Biden, or as a vice presidential nominee if Kamala Harris takes over the top of the ticket. Shapiro did not mention Harris in his message Sunday.“I am proud to work by his side and am grateful for his leadership and his unwavering commitment to delivering for Pennsylvania — the Commonwealth that raised him,” Shapiro said about Biden in the post.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nSchumer says Biden put 'his country, his party, and our future first'\n\nChuck Schumer shared in a post on X that \"Joe Biden has not only been a great president and a great legislative leader but he's a truly amazing human being.\"\n\n\"His decision of course was not easy, but he once again put his country, his party, and our future first. Joe, today shows you are a true patriot and great American,\" he added.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden exits race amid widespread pressure, mounting concerns about his age\n\nBiden's exit came after he received bleak warnings from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., that his candidacy could lead to massive losses for Democrats in the Senate and House. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B. Johnson who, in 1968 amid national unrest and turmoil within the Democratic Party over the Vietnam War, stunned the nation with his decision not to seek a second full term.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nWho could replace Biden?\n\nWith Biden's endorsement, Harris is the clear frontrunner to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee, but the party's bench of Democratic governors could also be in the mix including Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Gavin Newsom of California.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nTrump knocks Biden after exit\n\nDonald Trump, in a post on his social media web site Truth Social after Biden’s exit, wrote: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for President, and is certainly not fit to serve - And never was!”\n\n“We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly,” Trump added.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJill Biden reacts to Joe Biden dropping out of 2024 race\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden on Sunday reposted the president's message with heart emojis. She also retweeted her husband's message endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/04/15/nessel-democratic-endorsement-michigan-attorney-general/518873002/", "title": "Dana Nessel wins Democratic endorsement for Michigan attorney ...", "text": "In a unprecedented blow to organized labor, Plymouth attorney Dana Nessel won the endorsement for her bid for state attorney general from Democrats at a day-long convention Sunday.\n\nShe overcame a nearly unified group of organized labor, led by the United Auto Workers, that had endorsed former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Michigan Pat Miles of Grand Rapids.\n\nBut Nessel had forged a coalition of progressive activists, marijuana supporters and Democrats energized to join the party after the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2016.\n\nAfter nearly 10 hours of speeches and voting at Cobo Center, the 6,704 credentialed Democrats gave Nessel a victory. The energy all day had been with Nessel as the crowd continually shouted her name, gave her standing ovations and waved signs carrying her name.\n\n\"I think the Democratic Party was ready for a more unconventional candidate and race,\" said Nessel, who will be the first openly gay candidate to run for statewide office. \"I was really excited to get so many new members signed up. There's a lot of enthusiasm for the party in a way that we haven't seen it for while.\"\n\nNessel's mother-in-law Mary Maguire, the president of the Plymouth Democratic Club, nominated Nessel, saying, \"Dana always has been a relentless fighter for justice. She poured her heart and soul into the DeBoer case,\" referring to the one of the cases that went to the U.S. Supreme Court, resulting in a validation of same sex marriage.\n\n\"Having beaten Bill Schuette and Rick Snyder on this landmark case, she understood the power an attorney general can have,\" Maguire added.\n\nMore:Race for attorney general will dominate Democratic convention Sunday\n\nMore:Who's running for Michigan Attorney General in 2018?\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Barbara McQuade nominated Miles for the attorney general endorsement and said he has a leg up because he's already gone through a thorough vetting after being nominated for the Western Michigan U.S. Attorney slot by former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"He had to go through a rigorous background investigation by the FBI and if they couldn’t find any dirt on him, neither will the Republicans,\" she said.\n\nBut Miles conceded the race to Nessel, before the final vote was announced and urged his supporters to back Nessel.\n\n\"I will fully support the Democratic ticket in the fall,\" he said. \"We need to take the state back for the Demoratic party. We need to unify the party.\"\n\nThe vote marked the end of dominance of Democratic Party politics by the UAW, which for decades had been the deciding factor for candidates seeking the union's endorsement. With dwindling union numbers - which have declined by 2.9 million members since the mid 1980s - the endorsement of the UAW or AFL-CIO isn't as consequential as it once was.\n\n\"Whether or not the leadership of some of the unions supported me, I support unions in this state. I support workers,\" Nessel said. \"I hope they'll support me as well in November.\"\n\nThere was an enormous amount of energy in the crowd of more than 6,700 people, which is a far cry from the 700 people who showed up for the endorsement convention in 2010, said Michigan Democratic Party Chairman Brandon Dillon.\n\n“This is huge, even with the bad weather across the state,” he said. “There’s just such a real enthusiasm that people are chomping at the bit to do something.\n\nWe’ve seen it since Trump got elected. But the challenge is to make sure that energy is channeled into the right activities,” Dillon added. “It’s kind of like plutonium. It can be used for peaceful means or can be used to arm a nuclear warhead.”\n\nMost of the energy was directed at the only real race at the convention between Nessel and Miles. The two ran from room to room, making their case to the different constituency caucuses. William Noakes, a Detroit attorney, who had filed to become a candidate for attorney general, didn't get the required signatures -- about 500 -- needed on Sunday to be considered for the endorsement.\n\nAt the Women’s Caucus, Nessel said she keeps hearing that there could be too many women on the ticket, if former Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer wins the nomination for Governor and Jocelyn Benson gets the nod for Secretary of State.\n\n“You know what I say to that? Screw that noise,” she said. “More than ever, we need an attorney general who is willing to protect women in this state … We need to put as many women as possible on the Democratic ticket.”\n\nMiles said he would vow to fight the agenda of President of Donald Trump on issue after issue.\n\n“I’m a fighter and I’m ready to fight for you,” he said.\n\nThe race became a proxy for the fight between the traditional power brokers of the party – organized labor and African American constituencies – and the far left wing of the party.\n\nAt the Progressive Caucus, which has endorsed Nessel and former Detroit Health Department Director Abdul El-Sayed for Governor, retired Ann Arbor businessman Shri Thanedar tried to talk to the group. And even though he bills himself as the most progressive candidate in the race for Governor, he was refused the chance to speak and escorted out of the room amid chants from the caucus of “Abdul, Abdul!”\n\nThe labor caucus officially endorsed Miles and Whitmer, with United Auto Workers president Dennis Williams proclaiming that the labor movement has been at the forefront of the progressive movement for decades.\n\n“Today, we’re under attack like never before. Not just in Michigan, but across the country,” he said. “It’s time for labor to raise for our heads, march in the streets and say an injustice for one is an injustice for all.”\n\nDespite the extraordinary amount of participation at the convention, the crowd was warned that unless the factions can come together, they will lose in November. The worry was warranted as the race for attorney general became increasingly contentious in the last few weeks, with both Miles’ and Nessel’s campaign hurling insults and negative taunts at each other.\n\n“The only thing that could stop us from doing what we need to do, is if we are not united. We have vigorous primaries, and we should. We’re going to have a vigorous campaign today. But in November, we all have to be united as Democrats,” said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Bloomfield Township. “We can’t say, 'My candidate didn’t win, they’re not progressive enough,' or 'They’re too progressive.' Enough is enough! We have to be united or we will not win.”\n\nAnd U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, said she hated to be a “Debbie Downer, but everybody is talking about this blue wave. It’s not going to happen if we let complacency settle in.\n\n“If you stay home, we’re going to have six years of what we have right now and that should scare the hell out of everybody,” she added.\n\nWayne County Executive Warren Evans warned the crowd to calm down.\n\n\"The only thing that will stop us is if we get petty with each other. If your candidate wins or doesn’t, take a chill pill. All of our candidates are better than any of theirs,\" he said.\n\nAlso getting endorsements at the convention were: Supreme Court candidates Megan Cavanagh and University of Michigan law professor Sam Bagenstos and Benson for Secretary of State. The endorsements won't become official, however until the party's summer convention in August.\n\nContact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/15"}]}

Again!\n\nThat's right. Even though an Emmy ceremony aired on Fox just eight months ago, it's already time once again for TV's biggest night. This time it's on ABC, and hosted by the father/son acting duo of Eugene and Dan Levy (8 EDT/5 PDT). We ended up with two Emmys in one year because the January awards were delayed from last September by actors' and writers' strikes. So now the awards are back on track, and it's time to honor the best TV that streamed and aired between June 2023 and last May.\n\nBut who will be honored with a trophy and make an acceptance speech, and who will just be happy to be nominated? We parse through the awards season hullaballoo to predict who'll win Sunday, and who really should be walking away with the gold. Spoiler alert: Get ready to hear FX's \"The Bear\" and \"Shōgun\" a lot!\n\nWho will win at the (second) 2024 Primetime Emmys\n\nBest drama series\n\n◾ \"The Crown\" (Netflix)\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n◾ “Fallout” (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n◾ \"The Gilded Age\" (HBO)\n\n◾ \"The Morning Show\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n◾ \"Shōgun\" (FX)\n\n◾ \"Slow Horses\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ \"3 Body Problem\" (Netflix)\n\nShould/will win: \"Shōgun\"\n\nIf you haven't yet watched FX's historical epic \"Shōgun\" (streaming on Hulu) run, don't walk, to immerse yourself in the lush world of 1600s Japan. A new adaptation of James Clavell's celebrated novel, the series chronicles the first English contact with Japan amid a moment of political turmoil in the feudal island nation. With big sets, big performances and dazzling action, it's the \"Game of Thrones\" successor you didn't know you needed (without any dragons) and will likely nab a boatload of Emmys Sunday, including the top outstanding drama prize.\n\nBest comedy series\n\n◾ \"Abbott Elementary\" (ABC)\n\n◾ \"The Bear\" (FX)\n\n◾ \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (HBO)\n\n◾ \"Hacks\" (Max)\n\n◾ \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n◾ \"Palm Royale\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ “Reservation Dogs” (FX)\n\n◾ “What We Do in the Shadows” (FX)\n\nShould win: \"Reservation Dogs\"Will win: \"The Bear\"\n\nBecause of the Emmy calendar, it's the stellar second season of \"The Bear\" that is competing at this Sunday's Emmys, not the lackluster third that streamed this summer. So the shouty and profane restaurant employees should have no trouble walking away with the gold in this category for the second time (Season 1 scooped this up in January). But its FX sibling \"Reservation Dogs\" wasn't just one of the best comedies of the last year, it's one of the best shows of this century, a powerful and unique piece of art with a point of view you've never seen before. The TV Academy finally acknowledged the craft of \"Dogs\" with this nomination for its third and final season, but it's just not enough.\n\nBest limited/anthology series\n\n◾ \"Baby Reindeer\" (Netflix)\n\n◾ \"Fargo\" (FX)\n\n◾ \"Lessons in Chemistry\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ \"Ripley\" (Netflix)\n\n◾ \"True Detective: Night Country\" (HBO)\n\nShould win: \"True Detective: Night Country\"Will win: \"Baby Reindeer\"\n\nThe latest (and probably greatest) season of \"True Detective\" was a stunning chilly nightmare, but unfortunately, it can't compete with all the \"Baby Reindeer\" hype. Netflix's dark limited series from comedian Richard Gadd was a phenomenon, thanks to its deeply disturbing content, the (debatably) true story of a man being stalked and harassed by an older woman and the intimacy of the performances. All that and its popularity should propel the series to a win.\n\nLead actress, drama series\n\n◾ Jennifer Aniston, \"The Morning Show\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ Carrie Coon, “The Gilded Age” (HBO)\n\n◾ Maya Erskine, \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\" (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n◾ Anna Sawai, \"Shōgun\" (FX)\n\n◾ Imelda Staunton, \"The Crown\" (Netflix)\n\n◾ Reese Witherspoon, \"The Morning Show\" (Apple TV+)\n\nShould/will win: Sawai\n\nGet ready to know Anna Sawai because she's going to be a star. The actress, who has done great work in shows like Apple's \"Pachinko\" or \"Monarch: Legacy of Monsters,\" was one of the best things about the excellent \"Shōgun.\" Her superb performance as noblewoman and translator Toda Mariko is likely to propel the relatively unknown actress to a win over the A-listers in her category, and hopefully on to bigger and bolder fame in the process.\n\nLead actor, drama series\n\n◾ Idris Elba, “Hijack” (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ Donald Glover, \"Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n◾ Walton Goggins, \"Fallout\" (Amazon Prime Video)\n\n◾ Gary Oldman, \"Slow Horses\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ Hiroyuki Sanada, \"Shōgun\" (FX)\n\n◾ Dominic West, \"The Crown\" (Netflix)\n\nShould/will win: Sanada\n\nSpeaking of \"Shōgun\" names you'll want to know, veteran performer Sanada is finally getting his due with the FX series (he's also a producer). The Japanese actor, a standby in American pop culture with smaller parts in series (HBO's \"Westworld\") and films (\"Avengers: Endgame\") is the anchor \"Shōgun\" needs. His performance as an out-of-favor nobleman doing his best to stay alive is marvelous, to say the least. I'm glad Emmy voters noticed.\n\nLead actress, comedy series\n\n◾ Quinta Brunson, \"Abbott Elementary\" (ABC)\n\n◾ Ayo Edebiri, \"The Bear\" (FX)\n\n◾ Selena Gomez, \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n◾ Maya Rudolph, \"Loot\" (Apple TV+)\n\n◾ Jean Smart, \"Hacks\" (Max)\n\n◾ Kristen Wiig, \"Palm Royale\" (Apple TV+)\n\nShould/will win: Smart\n\nSmart money is on, well, Smart. The beloved actress has already won twice in this category for playing aging comedian Deborah Vance in Max's \"Hacks,\" and there's no reason to think her streak will be broken. Brunson deservedly took this category in January, but that's partly because Smart wasn't even in the race.\n\nLead actor, comedy series\n\n◾ Matt Berry, “What We Do in the Shadows” (FX)\n\n◾ Larry David, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (HBO)\n\n◾ Steve Martin, \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n◾ Martin Short, \"Only Murders in the Building\" (Hulu)\n\n◾ Jeremy Allen White, \"The Bear\" (FX)\n\n◾ D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, “Reservation Dogs” (FX)\n\nShould win: BerryWill win: White\n\nSpeaking of repeat winners, White is exactly the kind of performer likely to take another trip to the Emmy podium as long as he's starring in his critically acclaimed show. The TV Academy that said \"yes, chef!\" to his Season 1 performance will do the same for Season 2. It's a shame because while White is excellent, actors like Berry and Woon-A-Tai are doing slightly more interesting work in their respective shows. Berry, in particular, is a brilliant comedian in vampire satire \"Shadows,\" ending its run this fall, and has limited opportunities left to be recognized for his work.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "The numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly.

Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories.

This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, the latest from another assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Plus we take a closer look at Democrat's agenda on voting rights, and the FDA issues new guidelines for mammograms.\n\n♦\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump is safe following gunshots near his golf course in Florida his campaign and the Secret Service announced yesterday. The incident appears to be an assassination attempt on the former president, the second one in two months. The FBI says it's investigating. The incident took place at Trump International Golf Course in West Palm Beach, where Donald Trump was golfing shortly before 2:00 PM according to officials. Authorities said a man stuck the barrel of a rifle through the fence at the edge of the golf course while the former president was golfing. Secret Service agents on the course spotted the weapon and opened fire on the man who fled.\n\nDavid Aronberg, state attorney for Palm Beach County, confirmed to USA TODAY that a suspect in custody is 58-year-old Ryan Routh. Aronberg also said an AK-47 rifle, believed to belong to the suspect, was recovered at the scene. Aronberg said he appeared to be at least partly motivated by his strong support for Ukraine and its war against Russia.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for President, said in a statement yesterday that she is thankful that Donald Trump is safe following the reported attempted assassination. And President Joe Biden vowed to make sure the Secret Service has every resource for Trump's safety, adding that there is no place for political violence.\n\nExperts say agents in West Palm Beach appear to have handled the situation properly, two months after the Secret Service was heavily criticized about an earlier assassination attempt where a gunman with an AR style rifle shot at the GOP nominee from about 150 yards away.\n\n♦\n\nDemocrats say voting rights are under attack, but what's in their voting rights agenda if they win this fall? I spoke with USA TODAY Democracy Reporter Erin Mansfield for more.\n\nErin, thanks for hopping on today.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you for having me. Taylor.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Erin, Democrats say this year's election will determine not only the fate of a slew of issues, but also democracy itself. So before we get into some specifics, which voting rights bills has Vice President Kamala Harris said she would sign into law as president?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nSo the current names for them are the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. Those bills have in the past had different names often associated with the civil rights icon, John Lewis. They're essentially the same laws with a few modifications that happened over the years.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo let's walk through the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, starting with this idea of federal pre-clearance. What is that, Erin, and what's the significance here?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nIn the first half of the century, even though on paper the United States had ended slavery, had tried to make Black Americans equal citizens, functionally, they were still not able to vote. There were ridiculous things like literacy tests, counting jelly beans in a jar, stuff that basically meant Black people were not allowed to vote. So in 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, and one of the big pieces of it was this idea that these states, usually southern former slave states, had to pre-clear their voting laws with the federal government in order to have a review that made sure it didn't discriminate. So basically, instead of waiting for discrimination to happen and then having an aggrieved person sue, and fight, and take years and years in litigation, these states had to actually ask the federal government for approval. In a culture of states' rights, that's obviously a very contentious thing, but it is the reason that you don't have these really egregious voting rights violations in this day and age.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you mentioned, Erin, there's also the Freedom to Vote Act. This addresses a few things. Let's start with gerrymandering. Can you remind us what exactly gerrymandering is and what would this bill do to approach that issue?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nA long, long time ago, some guy named Gerry drew a congressional district that looks like a salamander, and that's where gerrymandering came from. But essentially, congressional maps are drawn by usually state legislatures. Sometimes there are independent commissions, but in a lot of states it's state legislatures. So whichever party runs that legislature will draw the maps. And there are ways to use really fancy GIS technology to figure out who in a certain neighborhood is going to vote for whom. And so what'll happen is, and this has happened in Democrat and Republican sides, New York recently has come under attack for it, Texas, Ohio on the Republican side, and basically you draw shapes, and let's say if you're given 35 congressional districts, you come up with a bunch of shapes to try to see how many statistically are likely to go to Republicans versus Democrats. And you end up with these really bizarre-looking districts that can run hundreds of miles, members of Congress who are representing people from multiple counties, but only small parts of those counties. This suburb is pulled into one district, another suburb is pulled into a different district, these three streets within a specific city, those have to be pulled into a different district. So that's what gerrymandering is, a way of manipulating congressional maps to partisan advantage.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, so what would the Freedom to Vote Act do here?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nIt would create a new law that said partisan congressional map drawing is illegal. Right now, the Supreme Court has been clear that you can't draw a map to discriminate on race, but they've been a lot more lax when it comes to discriminating based on party because, as we all know, party politics are as old as time, or as old, as least, as our country. And what this would do is it would make partisan gerrymandering illegal.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd you know, Erin, a core tenet of Democrats' approach and strategy when it comes to some of these issues around democracy has to do with voter registration. How does the Freedom to Vote Act approach that issue?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nIt would make it easier to register to vote, in a nutshell. One, they would have automatic voter registration. For a lot of people, if you've ever moved from one state to another, or even if you got your driver's license after you turned 18, the DMV probably asked you, \"Do you want to register to vote?\" or you've checked a box. What's become more popular lately is, instead of checking a box to say, \"Yeah, please register to me to vote,\" states are saying, \"We're going to register people to vote automatically and give them a box to check if they don't want to register to vote.\" It puts more work on the government. There's still an opt-out, but it's just a different decision to make and it's, \"Hey, you're going to be registered to vote. Is that okay? Is that not okay? Check the block and be done.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd, Erin, some folks listening might be thinking, \"Hey, Democrats have had the White House for four years, they have the Senate.\" What are some barriers to accomplishing some of these goals, getting these bills passed around democracy issues? Why haven't they in the Biden era?\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThe Democrats don't run the House and the House would not push this through because the Republicans largely oppose it. Now, that is a pretty modern example. While the original Voting Rights Act was pretty contentious historically, in this past generation or two, voting rights have been pretty bipartisan. However, one of the big things when they were trying to pull this through in 2022, the Democrats ran the House and they had 50 votes in the Senate. And because they had the vice president, that gave them a tiebreaker, so effectively they had control. But there's a rule in the Senate called a filibuster that requires you to get 60 votes. It means you need bipartisan support. So this is really a result of parties that do not see eye to eye.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, great insight here. Erin Mansfield covers democracy for USA TODAY. Thanks as always, Erin.\n\nErin Mansfield:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs they return to college campuses this fall, pro-Palestinian student activists are finding a new foe, lawyers for conservative states. Last month, two dozen Republican attorneys general sent a letter to Brown University ahead of the Ivy League school's planned vote to consider dropping its investments in companies with ties to the Israeli military. If that proposal is adopted, the officials warned it would have immediate and profound legal consequences for staff and students. The threat suggested the school could lose money if those state governments stopped doing business with them. But the attorneys general didn't spell out exactly how that could happen, and the actual impact anti-boycott laws could have on colleges like Brown is debatable.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Muslim Legal Fund of America shrugged off the warning, saying the letter was a fruitless attempt to force the school to comply with laws outside its jurisdiction. In a separate letter to Brown's administrators, lawyers for the fund called on the university to reject the baseless threats of legal repercussions. The debate marks a new phase in the campus divestment movement, as the few colleges where administrators consider protesters demands start a new school year. Most schools dismissed requests to disentangle their investments from companies with connections to Israel, but some seem to entertain those pushes more seriously. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nNew mammogram guidelines from the FDA shift what patients should know. I spoke with USA TODAY Health Reporter Karen Weintraub about the move that went into effect last week requiring mammogram centers to inform patients about breast density.\n\nHello, Karen.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nHello.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karen, what are these new guidelines for mammogram facilities?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah, so the FDA is now saying that women have to be told about their breast density. A number of states have already had similar guidelines or related ones, but now everybody has to be told. And breast density is a measure of how much fatty tissue a woman has in her breast relative to something called fibroglandular tissue, which is the stuff that contains the muscles and the milk ducts, sort of everything else but the fat. And you can't tell just by normal means how dense your breasts are. Nobody knows this just from observation or from knowing themselves. And you can't change this. You can't go on a diet and get less dense breasts. This is something you're just born with. Although some women do age out of it as they go through menopause, they get less dense breasts.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nRight. So do dense breasts then increase cancer risk? Is there a direct correlation there?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo mammograms can't see breast cancer in denser breasts as well, and so they tend to miss breast cancers. It's not necessarily that dense breasts are more likely to have cancer, but they're more likely to be missed when women with dense breasts have cancer.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo after a mammogram, healthcare providers may recommend women with dense breasts to get a breast ultrasound or MRI. Does insurance cover these cost, Karen, and what's the significance for women who cannot afford this extra step?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThis is a huge issue. A lot of insurance will not cover this follow-up. It is required to cover the initial mammogram. It's considered preventive care, and that's covered under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, required that preventive care like mammograms are covered. But the follow-up, like the MRI or the ultrasound, is not necessarily covered, and so many women can't follow through, can't afford it, or say, \"Oh, well, I'll get to it,\" and don't. I did a story a couple of months ago about a woman on Long Island named Cindy Russo who put it off, didn't have the spare $200 and ended up with stage three breast cancer. It's a terrible situation for women to be in.\n\nThis may be self-evident, but catching breast cancer early improves the chances of survival, and also the treatment gets much harsher the further along you are in breast cancer. Stage zero breast cancer is a simple, quick operation. Stage three breast cancer might involve radiation, chemotherapy, five years of hormone therapy. It's much more invasive, intrusive, costly, and life-altering. Hopefully, with everyone being told, there will be some pressure on insurance companies now to have to cover this follow-up.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd is there anything on the policy level to help fix this cost issue going forward and increase access to this extra testing?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nAt this point, there's talk but not action yet.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren Weintraub covers health for USA TODAY. Thank you, Karen.\n\n♦\n\nLast night marked the 76th annual Primetime Emmy Awards.

North Jersey notable natives who are buried in the state include Whitney Houston, Allen Ginsberg, Virginia Apgar, Aaron Burr and Grover Cleveland.\n\nAmong the non-native notables who are buried in New Jersey are Thomas Alva Edison, who was born in Ohio, Missouri-born Yogi Berra, Joey Ramone from New York and Althea Gibson originally from South Carolina.\n\nHere is a list of famous people who have New Jersey as their final resting place:\n\nThomas Alva Edison\n\nEdison, born in Milan, Ohio, and known as the Wizard of Menlo Park, is famous for making a workable lightbulb, inventor of the phonograph and an early film pioneer. His film studios eventually made almost 1,200 films.\n\nEdison was also a pioneer in the electric power grid, helping to light up sections of Manhattan in the late 19th century and eventually merged with a number of energy producers to become Consolidated Edison (ConEd) in 1936. The inventor and businessman died in 1931 at age 84. He was buried alongside his wife Mina at West Orange's Edison National Historic Site.\n\nEnoch Poor\n\nA brigadier general in Gen. George Washington's Continental Army, Poor was born and raised in Andover, Massachusetts. He took part in the invasion of Canada, and his brigade played a key role in fending off British attacks in the Battle of Freeman's Farm and Battle of Bemis Heights, collectively known as the Battle of Saratoga. His brigade was one of the many who wintered in Morristown in 1776 through 1777 and participated in the Battle of Monmouth in 1778.\n\nPoor was garrisoned near Hackensack where he died at age 44 after a brief illness that may some speculate derived from a gunshot wound suffered during a duel. After a funeral attended by his superior Marquis de Lafayette and Gen. George Washington, Poor was buried in the cemetery outside Hackensack's First Dutch Reformed Church.\n\nBen E. King\n\nBorn in Henderson, North Carolina, the \"Stand By Me\" singer moved to Harlem at age 9 but as an adult settled in Teaneck. Born Benjamin E. Nelson, King started in R&B groups before going solo and taking his stage name in 1960. \"Stand By Me\" was one of his first solo hits and the song's reemergence alongside the 1986 movie of the same name saw King become the first to have Billboard Hot 100 hits in the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s. King died in 2015 at the age of 76 and was buried in Hackensack Cemetery and Mausoleum.\n\nOlympia Dukakis\n\nA talented fencer in her youth who treated patients with polio before finding her place on stage and screen, Dukakis appeared in prominent dramatic films including \"Steel Magnolias,\" \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" and \"Moonstruck.\" The latter role earned her an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Dukakis moved to Montclair in 1970, where she raised three children with fellow actor Louis Zorich. Dukakis died in New York City in 2021 at the age of 89. She was interred in Montclair's Mount Hebron Cemetery.\n\nYogi Berra\n\nBorn in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1925, Berra signed with the New York Yankees in 1943 before joining the U.S. Navy and landing on Normandy Beach the following year. Though wounded in his catching hand during combat, Berra became one of the best catchers in Major League Baseball history, serving behind the plate for Don Larsen's perfect game, in game five of the 1956 World Series.\n\nBerra won the American League Most Valuable Player Award three times, the World Series 10 times and the All-Star Team 18 times. A long-time resident of Montclair, Berra was also known for his turns of phrase, known as \"Yogisms.\" Berra died in 2015 and was buried in Gate of Heaven Cemetery in East Hanover.\n\nAlthea Gibson\n\nA native of Silver, South Carolina, Gibson won plenty of gold. The Associated Press' Female Athlete of the Year in 1957 and 1958, Gibson won three of tennis' four Grand Slams and was the first Black player to compete in the women's pro golf tour.\n\nGibson, who moved to Harlem at a young age, later settled in East Orange. She became New Jersey's first female athletic commissioner in 1976 and the following year made an unsuccessful bid for State Senate. Gibson died in 2003 at age 76 and was buried in Rosedale Cemetery in Montclair.\n\nShirley Booth\n\nBorn Marjory Ford, Booth is one of just two dozen actors to have won an Oscar, a Primetime Emmy and a Tony Award.

She died in 1992 in her Massachusetts home and was buried in her family plot in Montclair's Mount Hebron Cemetery.\n\nMore:Scout helps preservation group restore slave cemetery in Mahwah\n\nDudley Moore\n\nDudley Moore was born in England and won a music scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford and later starred in London's West End. He appeared in several BBC TV shows but after marrying actress Tuesday Weld moved to the USA.\n\nHe won notice for his performance as a supporting actor in \"Foul Play\" and was selected as the lead in the iconic 1970's movie, \"10\".

He died three years later in Plainfield and was buried in Hillside Cemetery in Scotch Plains\n\nMichelle Thomas\n\nBorn in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1968, Thomas was crowned Miss Talented Teen New Jersey in 1984 and later that year appeared on \"Soul Train\".

She died the next year and was buried in Montclair's Rosedale Cemetery.\n\nJoey Ramone\n\nRamone, born Jeffrey Hyman in Queens, New York, was not the original lead singer of the iconic punk rock band, the Ramones. After Dee Dee Ramone determined he could not sing and play guitar at the same time, he turned over the frontman duties to Joey, who was a drummer turned guitarist.\n\nThe band had initially limited commercial or critical success. Still, the Ramones had an outsized influence on rock music and the punk subculture during its run from 1974 to 1996. Many credit the Ramones and their first concert at Greenwich Village's CBGBs in 1974 for ushering in the punk rock era. Diagnosed with lymphoma in 1995, Joey died six years later at the age of 49. He was interred in New Mount Zion Cemetery in Lyndhurst.\n\nDavid Prater\n\nPrater, a Grammy Award-winning soul singer best known for the song \"Soul Man,\" was born in Georgia.

Then 50, Prater was buried in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Totowa.\n\nElston Howard\n\nA St. Louis, Missouri, native, just like fellow New York Yankees catcher Yogi Berra, Howard in 1955 became the team's first Black player. The nine-time Major League Baseball all-star and 1963 American League Most Valuable Player later became a fixture in Teaneck. Howard moved there in 1958 and served on the Board of Education for Bergen County's vocational and technical high schools before he died in 1980 at the age of 51. Howard was buried in Paramus' George Washington Memorial Park.\n\nLuther Vandross\n\nBorn in Manhattan, New York, Luther Vandross won eight Grammy Awards during a heralded singing career that started at the famed Apollo Theater.

He was buried in George Washington Memorial Park, in Paramus.\n\nKitty Kallen\n\nBorn and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Kitty Kallen sang with many big band greats such as Harry James Jimmy Dorsey and Artie Shaw and is known for her song \"It's Been A Long, Long, Time,\" which she recorded with James in 1945 and played often to welcome the troops returning from the Second World War.\n\nShe began singing on the radio as a child. Kellen received formal training in music and was said to have flawless pitch and diction. Soon, she was singing with the big bands. Kallen's career contained no fewer than five hits. She spent most of her career living with her husband Budd Granoff in Englewood, but died in Cuernavaca, Mexico, in 2017 at 94. She was buried in Beth-El Cemetery in Paramus.\n\nLou Duva\n\nA legendary boxing trainer and promoter who worked with Evander Holyfield, Michael Moorer and Pernell Whitaker, Duva was born in New York City, New York, but grew up in Paterson. Duva started in boxing as a fighter in the 1940s but quit to open a trucking business. He nonetheless remained around the sport and in 1955 opened Garden Gym in central Paterson, launching his historic ringside run. Duva was inducted in the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998. He died 19 years later at the age of 94 and was buried in Totowa's Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Colfax\n\nBorn in 1756 in New London, Connecticut, Colfax was commissioned as a lieutenant in Gen. George Washington's Continental Army at the age of 17 and eventually served as a Capt. Washington's Life Guards. He participated in battles from Bunker Hill to Yorktown and was injured three times. Once, he took a bullet in his midriff.\n\nAfter the war, Colfax settled in modern-day Passaic County and served as a Bergen County judge and a New Jersey state legislator. He was called back to duty in his 50s to participate in the War of 1812 but ultimately returned to Wayne. He was buried there in 1838 in the Colfax Family Burying Ground.\n\nJoseph Wiseman\n\nBest known for playing the creepy villain in the James Bond film \"Dr. No,\" Wiseman was born in Montreal and raised in New York City. He was cast for his career-defining role in December 1961 at the age of 43. By then, Wiseman had been entertaining (and often unsettling) audiences for decades, starting his career at 16 and making his Broadway debut at 20 in \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois.\" Wiseman died in 2009 at the age of 91 in his Manhattan home. He was buried in King Solomon Memorial Park in Clifton.\n\nGeorge Gately\n\nBorn in Queens Village, New York, Gately was the cartoonist best known for creating “Heathcliff.” The younger brother of fellow cartoonist, John Gallagher, Gately in 1964 began his foray into newspaper comics with \"Hapless Harry.\" Nine years later, he introduced America to \"Heathcliff,\" a stout, toothy-grinned feline with a penchant for mischief. Gately retired in 1998 and died in 2001 at the age of 72, but \"Heathcliff\" lives on through his nephew, Peter Gallagher. Gately was buried in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Tenafly.\n\nLamont 'Big L' Coleman\n\nA Harlem rapper best known for his clever wordplay, street life subject matter and freestyling skills, Coleman was born in 1974 and died less than 25 years later when he was shot nine times in a drive-by shooting. During his brief career, Coleman worked with Columbia Records before forming his own label, Flamboyant Entertainment. In February 1999, when he was shot and killed, Coleman was on the brink of signing to Roc-A-Fella Records, which famously included Jay-Z. Like Howard and Vandross, Coleman was buried in George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus.\n\nMychal Judge\n\nIt may seem strange that a friar, albeit a chaplain for the New York Fire Department, is on this list but those who knew Judge said they knew a legend. He was the first official victim of the 9/11 attacks. Born in Brooklyn in 1933, Judge lived a courageous life ministering the aid and advocating for gay rights.\n\nOn Sept. 11, 2001, Judge rushed to the stricken towers and entered the lobby of the World Trade Center's North Tower to provide aid and comfort for the rescuers and survivors. When the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m., debris went flying through into the lobby and Judge died at that time from a heart attack at the age of 68. Judge's body was found and carried out of the North Tower by five people. He was buried in Totowa's Holy Sepulcher Cemetery.\n\nEstee Lauder\n\nA Queens, New York native born Josephine Esther Mentzer, Estee Lauder created a cosmetics empire.

Among the famous events explained by the participants, it chronicles from Eden to exile … from their first date to their twilight years … from bachelor and bachelorette … to being the world’s first parents. 'Journals' goes beyond the bare requirements of a night of Comfort Theatre, to become something that really does feel like it’s ready for prime time, which is to say, a more extensive engagement.”\n\nHal Linden\n\nLinden, 92, is known for his portrayal of Barney Miller in the 1970s TV show of the same name. It was about a police department in New York City, and the sitcom ran for eight seasons from 1975-82. This will be the second time Linden has been at Flat Rock Playhouse, the release said. His other stop was in 2022 when he performed in \"Two Jews Talking.\"\n\n“Except for my family, no one treated me as good as the people at Flat Rock,” Linden said in the release.\n\nWhile he'll always be mostly known for his Barney Miller role on TV, Linden's career spans more than 65 years on stage, which included winning a Tony Award for Best Actor In a Musical, which he won in 1971 for his portrayal of Mayer Rothschild in the musical \"The Rothschilds.\"\n\nMarilu Henner\n\nHenner, 71, will be celebrating a birthday just before her Flat Rock performance on April 6. She is best known for her role as Elaine in \"Taxi,\" which ran from 1978-82 on ABC and then another year (1982-83) on NBC.\n\nAccording to the release, Henner has also starred in seven Broadway shows (\"Gettin’ the Band Back Together,\" \"Tale of the Allergist’s Wife,\" \"Chicago,\" \"Social Security,\" \"Pal Joey,\" \"Over Here\" and \"Grease\"), 76 films and 31 Hallmark movies. She was also the leading character on the TV sitcom \"Evening Shade.\"\n\nThe five-time Golden Globe nominee is also a New York Times best-selling author of 10 books on health, parenting, memory and lifestyle improvement, according to the release.

The Express went winless in its first two seasons, followed by back-to-back three-victory campaigns.\n\nElmira had grown accustomed to playing morning consolation games at the Palmer tournament.\n\n“Getting on championship Wednesday, when the big teams are here, and having center court for a while letting everybody see how we can make plays, it’s huge,” Express head coach Jake Dailey said. “These girls have been working their tails off. I say that every time I talk to anybody. This makes it worth it.”\n\nThe four-day, 24-team varsity tournament ended Wednesday night with the National Division championship game between Shenendehowa, from the Albany area, and Rochester’s Bishop Kearney. Shenendehowa (10-0) held on for an 86-81 win behind 32 points from division MVP Kevin Huerter.\n\nShenendehowa claims National Division at Palmer tourney\n\nThree other championship games were played Wednesday. Binghamton Seton Catholic Central took the title in boys Regional Division 1 with a 45-35 win over Troy (Pennsylvania); Atholton (Maryland) topped defending champion Newfield, 37-25, for the boys Regional Division 2 title; and the Seton girls overcame a 16-0 deficit to beat Bishop Kearney in the girls Division 1 final, 68-65, in overtime.\n\nWednesday was also a good day for the Elmira boys, who took seventh place in the National Division with a 53-48 win over Southern Tier Athletic Conference rival Horseheads.\n\n“We said if we play in a tournament of this caliber and we get one victory, that’s good for us,” Elmira head coach Ryan Johnson said. “Anything else after that is icing on the cake. It didn’t matter who it was today. We played a good team and we got better because we were in the gym and that’s all that matters.”\n\nGirls Division 2 final\n\nElmira 76, North Penn 28: The Express took a 24-6 lead through one quarter that became 47-15 by halftime in handing North Penn-Mansfield its first loss following an 8-0 start.\n\nElmira hit six of its eight 3-pointers in the first half, including three from Anasah DeMember, who finished with 14 points. Zaria Thomas hit two 3-pointers and scored 13 points and Jaida Washington contributed 12 points. DeMember and Thomas were all-tournament picks, Washington won the Sixth Woman Award and Zaria DeMember-Shazer claimed top defensive player honors.\n\nFisher hit two 3-pointers in her 15-point first half. She finished the day 9-for-10 from the field.\n\n“She’s a phenomenal basketball player,” Dailey said. “She does everything right on the court and that makes my job easy. … She’s the real deal.”\n\nThe Express started two eighth-graders in Fisher and DeMember-Shazer. They have blended nicely with the team's veterans.\n\n“We played a team camp down in Waverly and then through AAU basketball the girls all played together,” Dailey said. “The chemistry started there.”\n\nDailey said he expects Elmira to compete in the top girls division at what is effectively its home tournament. Much remains to accomplish this season, with the players already talking about an upcoming STAC game against Vestal in the locker room after the game.\n\nTheir coach was pleased with how the Express defended the Tigers’ Ali Hillson, who has signed to play at Division II Lock Haven University. She finished with a team-high 12 points on 3-for-18 shooting from the field. As a team, the Tigers made only nine of 44 shots.\n\n“The same thing as the rest of the year. Everything starts on the defensive end,” Dailey said. “The girls sold out on defense. We shut down a great scorer in Hillson. She’s a great player and the key was stopping her and finishing possessions, and we did that.”\n\nGirls Division 1 final\n\nSeton 68, Bishop Kearney 65 (OT): Junior guard Lexi Levy scored 22 of her 30 points in the fourth quarter and overtime in earning division MVP honors as the Saints overcame two big deficits to top Bishop Kearney.\n\nIn regulation, Levy nailed a 3-pointer with 1:01 left to bring Seton (8-0) within 54-53. A fast-break bucket from Julia Hauer with 16 seconds left put Seton up by one. The Kings' Allure Simmons was fouled with 1.1 seconds left and made the first but missed the second, sending the game to overtime. Simmons finished with 26 points.\n\nLevy nailed her sixth 3-pointer of the night with 31 seconds left in overtime to give Seton a 64-63 lead, then converted a layup off a turnover for a three-point lead with 20 seconds remaining. Simmons scored for Bishop Kearney (6-2) and Hanna Strawn followed for Seton by hitting two free throws, making it a 68-65 lead with 6.3 seconds left.\n\nFollowing a timeout, Bishop Kearney was unable to get a clean look at a 3-pointer and tried a shot from underneath as the clock expired.\n\nAva McCann added 19 points for Seton, with her five 3-pointers helping the Saints rally back from a 16-0 hole out of the gate. Bishop Kearney led 50-34 with a late surge in the third quarter before Levy took over in the fourth quarter, hitting four 3-pointers and scoring 17 points.\n\nNational Division consolations\n\nElmira 53, Horseheads 48: Jadakis Brooks, a 6-foot-7 senior, capped a strong tournament with 20 points and eight rebounds to help the Express improve to 6-2. He connected on eight of 12 shots from the field.\n\n“He gets better and better each night,” Johnson said. “We’re asking him to guard the best guy on the other team defensively on one end of the floor and run our offense through him primarily on the other end of the floor. He’s responded. He’s doing a great job keeping his head up, just working through some things and giving us the best effort that he can.”\n\nDaShaun Sutton added 10 points for Elmira, which led 47-30 through three quarters on the way to a second win this season over defending STAC West and Section 4 Class AA champion Horseheads (5-4). Chris Whitson contributed nine rebounds.\n\nAndrew Clark had 16 points and nine rebounds for Horseheads. Carter McCormick made three 3-pointers and scored 11 points.\n\n“For the first three quarters of the game we executed our offense, we played very good defense,” Johnson said. “Both ends of the floor were very good. We stayed poised, we hustled and we worked hard. We struggled in the fourth quarter.”\n\nThe meeting between the schools is generally cause for packed gymnasiums at either school during prime time. Wednesday’s game started at 10 a.m., but an estimated 400 fans still showed up.\n\n“Both teams know it’s Elmira vs. Horseheads. I think both teams were prepared, both teams were ready,” Johnson said. “Tired at the same time mentally, physically, emotionally after a three-day run. Both teams came out hard. We had good tempo, good pace at the beginning of the game.”\n\nRice Memorial 47, Concord 39: Elliott Nelson continued his hot tournament shooting with four 3-pointers and 20 points as Burlington, Vermont’s Rice Memorial rallied for a win in the third-place game.\n\nRice outscored Concord (Wilmington, Delaware) 21-12 in the fourth quarter after trailing by one, with free throws in the final minute stretching the margin out.\n\nMarquis Christmas had 12 points for Concord.\n\nArchbishop Molloy 68, Bishop McDevitt 54: Cole Anthony scored 17 points and Justin Cole added 13 as New York City’s Archbishop Molloy finished with a 2-1 tournament record with a victory in the fifth-place game at Ernie Davis Academy.\n\nJames Williams led Bishop McDevitt with 26 points. The Crusaders are from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nBoys Regional Division finals\n\nSeton Catholic Central 45, Troy 35: Leo Gallagher connected for three 3-pointers and scored 19 points as the Saints (5-3) won the Regional Division 1 championship after grabbing a 17-7 lead through the first quarter.\n\nPeter Hartrick added seven points and nine rebounds in earning tournament MVP honors for the division.\n\nAnthony Deitrick had 10 points and eight rebounds for Troy.\n\nAtholton 37, Newfield 25: Jacob Waterworth scored 13 points and earned the division's MVP honors as Atholton pulled away in the fourth quarter to win the Regional Division 2 title with a win over Newfield.\n\nNewfield outscored the team from Columbia, Maryland 15-8 in the third quarter to get within 24-23, but the Raiders put the game away with a 13-2 edge in the final period.\n\nStephen LaBarge led Newfield with 12 points.

The outburst, coming just weeks after Hurricane Dorian's landfall in the Bahamas as a Category 5, tied a record for the most named storms whirling simultaneously.\n\n'Game of Thrones' ended, but left some unsatisfied\n\nWhen \"Game of Thrones\" premiered eight years ago, it was clear that the series was something different. The iconic show captivated millions and routinely left Twitter ablaze before, during and after its episodes were released. But, as USA TODAY TV critic Kelly Lawler laid out in her scathing review of the series finale, the show left some disappointed: \"(the final episode) was unrecognizable. It was hacky; it was cliched. Every character left standing received a saccharine coda. Closure is one thing, but pandering is entirely another,\" Lawler wrote. The HBO series still raked in some hardware at the 71st Primetime Emmy Awards in September, taking home the award for best drama series, its fourth win in the category.\n\nA Thanksgiving-week flight landed with an extra passenger\n\nA baby girl was born on an American Airlines jetway, an uncommon birthplace that inspired the newborn's fitting moniker: Lizyana Sky Taylor. Nereida Araujo gave birth to \"Baby Sky\" after her plane landed in Charlotte, North Carolina, the day before Thanksgiving, one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. \"Baby Sky decided to enter the world on a plane,\" Araujo wrote on Facebook. \"Mommi (sic) handled it well thanks to everybody who assisted us with love & care.\"\n\nGirl power: Simone Biles, USWNT transcend controversy\n\n“Am I in a league of my own? Yes. But that doesn’t mean you can’t credit me for what I’m doing.” That's what international gymnastics superstar Simone Biles told NBC after learning of a controversial rule that, as USA TODAY's Nancy Armour put it, \"watered down the value\" of a new element Biles planned to unveil. Much like the transcendent Biles, the U.S. Women's National Team dealt with their share of controversy at this summer's FIFA Women's World Cup, headlined by a clash with President Donald Trump, who said it's wrong that veteran player Megan Rapinoe protests during national anthem. In the end, the USWNT capped off an iconic decade with a dominating run through the World Cup that ended with its third consecutive title.\n\nBest of the decade:US women end 2010s where they started it, as world's best\n\nInternet pokes fun at Trump's appearance in front of altered presidential seal\n\nThe internet had fun at President Donald Trump's expense when he walked onstage in front of a presidential seal that, upon closer examination, appeared to have been altered to include symbols representing Russia and golf. The seal includes a double-headed eagle, unlike the single head of the traditional presidential seal, and seems to resemble the Russian coat of arms. The eagle also appears to be holding several golf clubs instead of arrows in its claws, perhaps a reference to Trump's affinity for golf. Instead of \"e pluribus unum,\" the scroll above the eagle appears to say \"45 es un titere,\" which appears to translate from Spanish to mean \"45 is a puppet.\"\n\nKristoff St. John, Disney Mouseketeer Dennis Day among 2019 celebrity deaths\n\nThe death of \"Young and the Restless\" star Kristoff St. John at 52 snatched readers' attention in February. St. John died as a result of a heart disease, an autopsy report later detailed. Alcohol was detected in his blood samples, and a toxicology panel detected the prescription anti-anxiety drugs Nordiazepam and Librium (chlordiazepoxide). St. John had played the character of Neil Winters since 1991 on the long-running CBS daytime soap opera. Soon after St. John's death, readers followed the disappearance and death of Dennis Day, an original Disney Mouseketeer. Day, 76 at the time of his death, was once among the most famous child performers on American television.\n\nUniversal character makes 'OK' symbol on 6-year-old's shoulder; actor gets fired\n\nA family vacation was thrust into the national spotlight when a 6-year-old girl, who is biracial and has autism, posed for a picture with Gru, a character from \"Despicable Me,\" at Universal Orlando Resort. The character formed an upside-down \"OK\" symbol with his fingers, recognized by some as a hate symbol, on the girl's shoulder, according to a photo and video reviewed by USA TODAY. The actor was later fired, a resort spokesman told USA TODAY. \"We just wanted to take them to see the minions,\" said Tiffiney Zinger, mother of the girl and 2-year-old boy shown in the video. \"This person ruined that special warm feeling.\"\n\nTrump threatened to close border while Texas cities, border facilities were overwhelmed with migrants\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the border had hit its \"breaking point.\" Organizers at the the Catholic Charities Humanitarian Respite Center in McAllen, Texas, were used to handling 200 to 300 migrants a day. Instead, they were arriving at a clip of around 800 a day, overflowing the respite center and straining city resources. Mounting pressure and chaos at the border prompted Trump in March to declare a national emergency and threaten to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico didn't stop undocumented migrants from coming.\n\nCVS closed 46 stores, and people needed to know where\n\nCVS Health announced closings for 46 of its stores in May, saying the locations were \"underperforming\" as the drugstore chain continued to shift more of its retail presence toward health care services. The cuts represent fewer than 1% of the about 9,600 CVS Pharmacy stores nationwide.\n\nOther companies announcing store closures in 2019 include Sears, GameStop, GNC, Pier 1 Imports and Kmart. Bed Bath & Beyond also caught readers' attention when it increased its number of expected store closures to 60.\n\nBaseball fan throws 96 mph, then signs with Oakland A's\n\nWhen baseball fan Nathan Patterson paid a visit to the speed-pitch radar booth at Coors Field, he probably didn't expect it would amount to much more than a few oohs and aahs. The 23-year-old, who told MLB.com he hadn't thrown \"for a few years\" before August 2018, fired off a 96-mph fastball. Two weeks later, he signed with the Oakland A's. Patterson, who played high school baseball but didn't pursue it in college, logged a little over five innings pitched in Oakland's minor league system.\n\nContributing: Kelly Lawler, Cydney Henderson, Nicholas Wu, Jayme Deerwester, Anika Reed, Adrianna Rodriguez, Aaron Montes, Rick Jervis, Nathan Bomey", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/17"}]}

Tom Carper, a patriarch of modern Delaware politics, will retire next year, ending a career as one of the most successful politicians in state history.\n\nHis announcement Monday at the Wilmington Riverfront will undoubtedly shake up the state, with now an open U.S. Senate seat in 2024.\n\n\"While nothing is forever, the Delaware Democratic Party is blessed today with a bench as strong as any I’ve ever seen in the 50 years that I’ve called Delaware home,\" Carper said in a prepared speech. \"If there was ever an opportune time to step aside and pass the torch to the next generation, it’s coming, and it will be here on January 3, 2025.\n\n\"But, until then, God willing, I’ll continue working 60-hour weeks and coming home on the train most nights as long as Martha keeps leaving the light on for me.\"\n\nCarper has been in statewide public office since 1977, serving as Delaware treasurer, congressman, governor and senator. He helped establish Delaware Democrats’ now longstanding ideology of socially liberal but center on economic and fiscal issues.\n\nAnd he has been one of the most prominent representations of “The Delaware Way\" − a less adversarial approach to politics that prioritizes building consensus. Yet critics have also derided this mentality for its behind-the-scenes politicking.\n\nThroughout the decades, he remained popular with Delaware voters. In 2018, he faced his most challenging primary in years when he faced then-newcomer Kerri Evelyn Harris, who is now a state representative in the Delaware General Assembly.\n\nCarper defeated her by a 30-point margin, ultimately capturing 60% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBefore running for reelection in 2018, Carper said at the time that he considered retiring. But that changed with former President Donald Trump’s victory in 2016.\n\nIt’s hard to find an elected Delaware official, and their respective deputy, who has not campaigned, interned or worked for the politician. Known as “Carper Town,” there’s an intricate web of connections, careers and marriages that can be traced back to the senior senator.\n\nFor years, many have viewed Delaware’s lone congresswoman Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester as the heir apparent to Carper’s seat. Delaware has never elected a woman or person of color to the U.S. Senate.\n\nBut Gov. John Carney, whose career trajectory has been very similar to Carper’s, is in his final term as governor. He has not indicated what his future plans will be.\n\nTom Carper’s political history\n\nCarper, born in West Virginia and raised in Virginia, first came to Delaware in 1973 as an M.B.A. student at the University of Delaware. He had served as a naval flight officer in the Vietnam War, making Carper the only remaining Vietnam veteran in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThree years later, at age 29, he was elected as Delaware’s state treasurer. The Delaware Democratic Party was in the midst of transformation, in part from Joe Biden’s shocking upset against Caleb Boggs in the 1972 U.S. Senate race.\n\nThe two have been friends for decades. Carper noted in his speech that it was Biden, who calls him Tommy, who encouraged him to run for U.S. Senate.\n\nCarper served as Delaware’s sole congressman for a decade, then as Delaware governor for two terms before running for U.S. Senate in 2000. One of Carper’s signature achievements as governor was his role in the development of the Wilmington Riverfront, where he made his announcement Monday.\n\nIn the U.S. Senate, Carper has been vocal on climate change, serving as chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. He has also led the quest to make Washington, D.C. the country’s 51st state.\n\nCarper, in his speech, spoke of his efforts to \"help center and clean up the Democratic Party,\" which \"have borne great fruit.\" Democrats control every statewide seat in Delaware.\n\nIs age a factor in Carper's retirement?\n\nCarper, at age 76, is not considered to be one of the older U.S. senators. The reelection bid of 80-year-old Biden and the health decline of 89-year-old U.S. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, has put renewed scrutiny on the age and well-being of U.S. politicians.\n\nMaryland U.S. Senator Ben Cardin, 79, recently announced his retirement earlier this month, citing his age as one of the factors in his decision.\n\nFor about a decade now, Carper has fiercely pushed back on questions of his health, primarily lobbed by opponents. When asked about his health during a campaign event in 2012, Carper responded by doing more than 30 push-ups on a folding table as supporters cheered.\n\nCarper, in his speech, did not cite a specific reason for retirement.\n\n\"As last year came to a close and the new one began,\" he said in his speech, \"Martha and I began to focus on what I should do next - run for a fifth term in the Senate which - if I won - would be a record 15 statewide elections or ride off into the sunset and call it a day.\"\n\n\"After a good deal of prayer and introspection, and more than a few heart-to-heart conversations, we've decided I should do neither but, rather, run through the tape over the next 20 months...\"\n\nWhat Carper is known for\n\nThe senator is also known for his quirks. He famously drove a 2001 Chrysler Town & Country minivan , called the “Silver Bullet,” for two decades, racking up close to 600,000 miles.\n\nIn his final 20 months in office, Carper said he plans to help implement the significant climate provisions he helped write that passed in the infrastructure and inflation laws recently passed by Congress.\n\nHe called representing Delaware in public office as the “great privilege” of his life.\n\n“I’ve never felt the gratitude and affection of so many Delawareans as I feel today when traveling through our Small Wonder,\" he said in his speech. \"It is palpable, it is a source of joy, and it is deeply, deeply appreciated.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/21/lisa-blunt-rochester-delaware-senate-race-2024-elections-tom-carper/70329181007/", "title": "Lisa Blunt Rochester bidding for Tom Carper's Senate seat for ...", "text": "U.S. Rep.

According to his campaign website, he later joined the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and has an extensive career in law enforcement.\n\nThe Republican gubernatorial candidate emphasized he would focus on insurance reform, nursing home financial fairness, drug crimes and rehabilitation, education and career readiness, and strengthening law enforcement.\n\n“My experiences have shaped my perspective, and I am compelled to address the pressing issues facing our beloved state,” Price said in his campaign literature. “Health challenges resulting from my past service limit my ability to patrol and protect, but they have not diminished my commitment to the well-being of Delawareans.”\n\nDover veteran vies for Republican line in congressional race\n\nDonyale Hall, a 53-year-old veteran, business owner and mother of 10, said she is seeking the Republican nomination for Delaware’s at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat.\n\nHall, a biracial African American woman from Dover who has run for political office before, said the platform she’s always run on resonates on any level.\n\nShe said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nHall also seeks to expand small business opportunities and improve the public education system.\n\n“I feel I bring unique vantage points to the things that I feel are problematic with our government,” Hall said. “I’m just continuing to forge a pathway that provides opportunity for people.”\n\nCarney considers mayoral run as Purzycki won't run for 3rd term\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki, who easily won two terms as Delaware's largest city's mayor, announced he will not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family.\n\nRELATED:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\nPurzycki saw a city undergo tremendous economic development, while also struggling with ongoing crime.

Kyle Evans Gay, a Democrat representing North Wilmington, announced in late August the launch of her campaign for lieutenant governor, resulting in an even more competitive race for 2024.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator previously worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\n“Delaware families know that raising kids is hard work, and it’s harder when the deck is stacked against working parents and working people,\" Gay said in her campaign announcement. \"It’s what drove me to run for the State Senate, where I worked to pass bills that make it easier for Delawareans to afford the basics and raise a family.\"\n\n“Delawareans know we have a lot more work to do,\" she said. \"That’s why I’m running for Lieutenant Governor: to make sure Delaware works for working people.”\n\nEugene Young to run for Congress\n\nEugene Young, former director of the Delaware State Housing Authority, announced this summer that he is running for Delaware’s at-large U.S. congressional seat.\n\nYoung, who made the announcement in a campaign email, has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years.

Tom Carper for his past votes on U.S. Supreme Court nominees.\n\nThe ads are being paid for by the Working Families Party, a New York-based coalition of unions and activists that Thursday will announce its endorsement of Carper's primary opponent Kerri Harris – an insurgent progressive and political newcomer from Dover.\n\n\"In the Donald Trump era, we need someone voters can trust to be a reliable and progressive fighter for working- and middle-class families,\" said Joe Dinkin, the party's national campaigns director. \"We think Kerri is someone who has been an inspiration and aggressive activist on all the things we believe in.\"\n\nThe minor party's support is just the latest example of how progressives both in and outside of the Democratic Party are taking Harris' longshot bid seriously and helping to drum up national attention for her campaign.\n\nBut it is one of the first instances in which Harris' rising star power will be visible to large swaths of Democratic voters here in Delaware.\n\nThe Facebook ads the group plans to run starting Thursday seek to convince likely Democratic voters that Carper has been weak on blocking Republican nominees to the high court.\n\nIt's a strategy meant to play on the immediate concerns those voters might have over President Donald Trump's nomination of conservative Judge Brett Kavanaugh to fill the seat of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nTo block Kavanaugh's confirmation, Democrats will need every one of their senators to vote no and get some help from at least two Republicans.\n\nCarper has called Kavanaugh's record \"extreme\" and \"deeply concerning.\" On Wednesday he made it clear he would not back his confirmation.\n\n\"If I had known 12 years ago how Judge Kavanaugh would have ruled on any number of issues, including health care and the environment, I never would have voted for him in 2006,\" he said in an email sent by his campaign. \"I have no intention of voting for him now.\"\n\nYet Carper is the only Democrat still in the Senate who voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia – a fact Harris' supporters are quick to point out.\n\nHe also has come under criticism for voting to confirm Bush nominee Chief Justice John Roberts in 2015 and voting against a filibuster on the 2006 confirmation of Bush nominee Justice Samuel Alito.\n\nHe later voted against Alito taking the bench and last year voted against confirming Trump nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nLittle of that nuance is contained in the Working Family Party's Facebook ads.\n\n\"A conservative Supreme Court majority threatens reproductive choice and LGBTQ rights, and could give corporations even more power in our Democracy,\" one version reads. \"Tom Carper voted for John Roberts, failed to block Sam Alito and empowered the Trump Majority. This September, we deserve progressive Democrat Kerri Harris.\"\n\nThe ads also carry taglines such as \"Tom Carper caved on the court\" and \"Tom Carper created the Roberts Court.\"\n\nHarris on Wednesday said she had not seen the ads but welcomed scrutiny of Carper's voting record.\n\n\"I think it's something that needs to be called out,\" she said. \"But if, in my opinion, if they are disrespectful or not hinging on the facts, I would make sure to call that to someone's attention.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether attacking Carper's votes on Supreme Court nominees will have an impact among Democratic primary voters.\n\nPrevious attempts to go negative against the three-term senator have ended in failure, including far more personal stabs at his military record and a well-documented domestic violence incident involving his first wife in the early 1980s.\n\nCarper has never lost an election in his 40-year political career, including stints as state treasurer, Delaware's lone U.S. congressman, governor and now its senior U.S. senator.\n\nThat does not mean he is unstoppable, however.\n\nCarper in January turned 71 – the same age as former governor and congressman Michael Castle when he lost the 2010 Republican primary for U.S. Senate to tea party favorite Christine O'Donnell.\n\nHis primary opponent also is rapidly gaining notoriety among a national progressive movement that has proven formidable in the early 2018 election cycle.\n\nLast month, for instance, Harris got a shoutout tweet from fellow progressive political newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, just days after the Democratic socialist upset 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in New York.\n\nShe further earned credibility among progressives when she and nearly 600 other women were arrested in Washington, D.C., two weeks ago while protesting the federal government's family separation policy and calling for the abolishment of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harris has recorded a sizable bump in campaign contributions, volunteers from out-of-state and media reports lumping her in with other progressive outsiders looking to oust incumbents.\n\nMany of those candidates have already proven successful thanks to support from the Working Families Party. The group, for instance, was active in recent primaries and general elections won by Maryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Ben Jealous, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner.\n\nDinkin declined to say how much money the party is investing in its ad buy for Harris but insisted the group will remain active in Delaware's U.S. Senate race at through the primary.\n\n\"We're at a moment in which surprising results are possible,\" he said. \"We think Kerri is kind of candidate our members can get excited about, and we're going to work really hard to get her elected.\"\n\nCarper's campaign noted he also has received endorsements this year, including support from unions such as the Delaware AFL-CIO and the state educators union, along with political action committees for National Resources Defense Council, Planned Parenthood and LGBTQ rights in Delaware.\n\nThe Delaware Democratic Party also endorsed Carper late Wednesday, making him the only candidate in a contested primary to receive the blessing of the state executive committee.\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nMORE POLITICAL NEWS:\n\nEarly voting, election day registration approved by Delaware House\n\nDelaware Senate candidate owes $50K to feds, $10K to state\n\nMass incarceration, judicial racial disparities dominate Democrat's campaign for attorney general", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/04/19/beau-biden-alters-usual-political-path/7921705/", "title": "Beau Biden alters usual political path", "text": "Jonathan Starkey\n\nThe News Journal\n\nBeau Biden%2C 45%2C had surgery in August to remove what his doctor called a %22small lesion%22 from his brain.\n\nBiden was first elected as Delaware%27s attorney general in 2006.\n\nHis decision now has both parties searching for candidates for the coming attorney general race.\n\nBiden had raised more than %241 million for his 2014 re-election campaign.\n\nAttorney General Beau Biden's announcement last week that he would not seek re-election so he could focus on a 2016 race for governor came in typical fashion: he issued a written statement and offered no public comment.\n\nIt's become routine for Biden, a high-profile public official who has made a habit of avoiding the public spotlight and the media. He has made few appearances and said little publicly about his health since receiving treatment in August at a Texas cancer center. He responded to intense criticism about his office's prosecution of a child rapist from a prominent Delaware family who received probation over prison time by issuing a written statement and declining media interviews.\n\nLast Thursday, on one of the most significant days of his political career, he described the end of a chapter in his public service in an email.\n\n\"The Office of Attorney General is a four-year commitment,\" Biden said. \"Its responsibilities are too significant, and the voters' trust too important not to give it my complete and undivided attention. It should not be, nor can it become, a two-year staging ground for another elected office.\"\n\nBiden's approach to public office in 2014 is surprising to many.\n\n\"In this day and age, for a modern political figure to not open themselves up for scrutiny, accountability, is unprecedented,\" said John Flaherty, president of the Delaware Coalition for Open Government, and a former Delaware-based aide to then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, the attorney general's father. \"It's perplexing.\"\n\nIt's also a reminder that for Beau Biden, who is arguably the state's most popular politician, the normal rules don't apply.\n\nMolly Magarik, Biden's political director, said his health did not impact his decision not to seek re-election as attorney general. Biden, 45, underwent surgery in August to remove what his doctor called a \"small lesion\" from his brain. He also suffered what was described as a \"mild stroke\" in 2010, causing him to miss several weeks of work. His Texas doctors said in a February statement that Biden received \"a clean bill of health\" about three months earlier.\n\nBut his surprise announcement, and his unwillingness to answer questions publicly, has only fueled speculation that Biden's health remains an issue and a threat to his political career. It was an unusual declaration, that he would not continue in public service so he could seek public service two years later.\n\n\"If you're not standing up to the total media review of your situation, you always run the risk that people are going to say there's a health problem,\" said former Delaware Gov. and U.S. Rep. Mike Castle, a Republican, who held a walking news conference in Rockford Park after suffering a stroke ahead of his 2006 election.\n\n\"Most people have a normal curiosity as to exactly what the problem was and what the treatments were. And then the doctors saying he is OK would be the icing on the cake. As it is, it just has people raising the question.\"\n\nHealth questions\n\nRepublicans, and a few Democrats, have raised the issue of Biden's health repeatedly since his announcement that he was not running for office this year, despite having hired a campaign staff and raising $1.2 million.\n\nCharlie Copeland, chairman of the Delaware GOP, said his party \"has disagreed with the attorney general on many occasions, but he deserves our gratitude for his service to the state. We hope that his health improves.\"\n\nSen. Greg Lavelle, a Sharpley Republican who is among those mentioned as potential candidates for governor in 2016, said \"it's clear to me [Biden's health] is playing a role in any decision he makes.\n\n\"That's an analysis of a political run that I've never heard before,\" Lavelle said. \"He raised a million and a half dollars to run for attorney general not to run for attorney general?\"\n\nFlaherty said Biden should be more open to questioning to avoid speculation about this health.\n\n\"He's allowing a lot of questions to surface, a lot of rumors to go rampant,\" Flaherty said. \"I think he needs to start saying, 'I was sick last year. I've been sick before. Other people have been sick in the past.'\"\n\nBiden's silence \"is not stopping any of us from talking,\" Flaherty said.\n\nState House Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf criticized those still questioning Biden's health. He said the statement in February from his doctor should have quelled speculation.\n\n\"He's working. He's out there. He's just not out there doing press conferences,\" Schwartzkopf said. \"It's almost like Obama, where he gives them a birth certificate and they still want to see his birth certificate.\"\n\nKathleen Jennings, who works for Biden as the state prosecutor, said she learned about his intention to skip this year's attorney general's race before the announcement, but was surprised by his decision. She would not comment on whether she advised Biden one way or another, adding that the way he announced his decision, in an email without public comment, was in character.\n\n\"I don't think you can glean anything from the announcement ... other than Beau is a careful guy,\" Jennings said. \"I work with him on a daily basis, I see him all the time. I know that he carefully weighs decisions before they're made. This was an example of that. I'm sure he gave it a lot of thought.\"\n\nStill popular\n\nThe truth is, Biden isn't a typical politician seeking office in Delaware.\n\nIn September, a University of Delaware poll identified him as the state's most popular, and recognizable, politician. Of the 902 adults who participated, 64.2 percent viewed Biden favorably, versus just 16.9 percent who had unfavorable views and 7.1 percent who had never heard of the attorney general.\n\nBiden topped long-serving politicians like U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, who hasn't lost a race in a career that dates back to 1976, in popularity and name recognition.\n\n\"Those numbers are very good,\" University of Delaware political science professor Paul Brewer said at the time. \"He's up there with [Gov. Jack] Markell and Carper who have been around a long time and have won a lot of elections. I think that reflects the strength and popularity of Beau Biden in the state.\"\n\nDelaware election law now allows Biden to move money raised for the attorney general campaign into a new campaign account for the 2016 governor's race. He had about $902,000 on hand last year, plus about $44,000 in his political action committee, Beau PAC.\n\n\"To not, at a minimum, contact donors that have given to the attorney general's race and offer to refund their money simply doesn't smell right,\" said John Fluharty, executive director of the Delaware GOP. \"These people gave under the pretense that they were giving to the attorney general's race.\"\n\nTradition broken\n\nBut by not seeking election to a third term – his victory all but assured, with no opponents filed – Biden also is abandoning a tradition of politicians using their platform in public office to pursue a higher post.\n\nHolding office while running for another \"gives you a profile, an ability to shape an agenda that you wouldn't normally have. He does give that up,\" said G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa.\n\n\"On the positive side, he doesn't have to be accused of running for an office that he doesn't intend to keep.\"\n\nMarkell won election to the governor's office in 2008 midway through his third term as state treasurer, also using funds raised during his 2006 treasurer campaign to bolster his war chest for the governor's race. Joe Biden campaigned for the U.S. Senate and vice president simultaneously in 2008.\n\nCriticism that officials misuse their current office to seek a higher post \"typically doesn't go anywhere,\" Madonna said.\n\nBiden's supporters say his decision to not use his post as attorney general as a launch pad into the governor's office is one that everyone should support.\n\n\"I know everybody does it and there's a wink and a nod, but he just couldn't run for re-election as AG if, in his heart, he knew there was a very good chance he would not finish the four years,\" said former U.S. Sen. Ted Kaufman, who earlier served as a top aide to Joe Biden in the U.S. Senate and was appointed to assume Biden's seat when he was elected vice president.\n\nOthers expressed a similar sentiment.\n\n\"How many people in public office do this? Everybody asks people in public office to be transparent. Beau is transparent,\" said Bart Dalton, a Wilmington lawyer and former chief deputy attorney general. \"If you've worked in the Attorney General's office, you can't be in two minds in that office. You have to be of one mind.\"\n\nMagarik, Biden's political director, offered a glimpse Friday about what Biden considers as his legacy from his eight years as attorney general. Magarik highlighted Biden's creation of a Child Predator Task Force to prosecute crimes against children, a task force that has led to 180 convictions for dealing in child pornography and other sex crimes. Biden also successfully pushed for anti-bullying measures, and stricter sentences for possessing and dealing in child pornography.\n\nAs attorney general, Biden has secured millions in bank settlements, and sued the ratings agency S&P and the mortgage registry MERS for their roles in the mortgage crisis, using money to help assist homeowners, she said.\n\nThrough Magarik, Biden declined to be interviewed. \"He'll talk about running for governor, about the challenges and opportunities ahead for our state at the appropriate time,\" Magarik said.\n\nNew candidates emerge\n\nBiden's decision has had one immediate impact: a reshuffling of the state's political landscape.\n\nSome well-known public officials are openly discussing their interest in seeking the attorney general's office.\n\nLt. Gov. Matt Denn says Biden's announcement last week has led him to consider an attorney general campaign, which, if he won, would require him to leave the lieutenant governor's office two years early.\n\nAlso in the mix for attorney general is Jennings, the state prosecutor.\n\n\"I've been approached by several people, both inside and outside law enforcement, in the wake of this decision urging me to run. There is really no doubt that my lifelong vocation has been criminal justice,\" Jennings said.\n\n\"I care deeply for the mission of the Attorney General's office and the people who work there every day. For all of those reasons, I am carefully considering my options,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans are pursuing former U.S. Attorney Colm Connolly, who declined to comment when reached Friday. Ferris Wharton, the former federal prosecutor now working as a public defender who lost to Biden in 2006, also has been considered a potential Republican candidate.\n\nBut Wharton, who also is said to be seeking a Superior Court judgeship, said he had no interest in the race.\n\n\"That is a huge commitment in both time and money,\" Wharton said. \"Frankly, I've been busy with other things.\"\n\nWharton, who worked as chief deputy under Attorney General M. Jane Brady, lost by five percentage points to Biden in the 2006 election.He, like many others, was \"surprised\" by Biden's announcement.\n\n\"It's not your typical way of doing it,\" Wharton said. \"Historically, most people like to have some places to fall back on if they're not successful. His approach here is different and that's part of what the surprise is.\"\n\nBiden's interest in the governor's race could have a \"chilling effect\" on Republicans and Democrats who might have had gubernatorial ambitions, Castle said. That's because of the popularity of the Biden name, and his high-profile ability to raise campaign money.\n\n\"People have been watching for him to make a move and this is it,\" said Rhett Ruggerio, a Dover lobbyist who hosted a fundraiser for Biden in Lewes in August. \"I really think it just comes down to, who in the Democratic Party is going to primary him? There's nobody who is going to step up to that challenge. They would have serious difficulty in every facet of the game.\"\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/07/31/2024-senate-elections-seats-up-for-reelection/70321610007/", "title": "What senators are up for reelection in 2024?

Sinema left the Democratic Party in December 2022 over concerns of \"rigid partisanship.\"\n\nSinema will not run for reelection, citing increased polarization in the Senate. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D.-Ariz., is the leading Democratic candidate to fill Sinema's seat. Kari Lake, a former news anchor and 2022 gubernatorial candidate, is the leading Republican choice.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDianne Feinstein\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAfter winning California's \"jungle primary,\" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey will be on the ballot in November to fill the seat of the late Feinstein, who died in September 2023. The Super Tuesday ballot featured Schiff, Garvey and two other Democratic House lawmakers: Reps. Barbara Lee and Katie Porter.\n\nSome feel Schiff is to thank in part for Garvey's second-place finish – he spent millions of dollars on ads boosting Garvey in the lead-up to the primary. The race for the liberal state's Senate seat is all but secured for Schiff as Californians haven't voted in a Republican Senator since 1988.\n\nConnecticut\n\nChris Murphy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMurphy has served as the senator from Connecticut since 2013 and is expected to cruise to reelection in 2024 in predominantly blue Connecticut. During his time in the chamber, he has made gun control a major issue, often referencing the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting in his home state.\n\nDelaware\n\nTom Carper\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCarper, who originally won his seat in 2000, will not seek another term. In his retirement announcement, Carper endorsed Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester to be his successor. Blunt Rochester formally announced her candidacy in June.\n\nFlorida\n\nRick Scott\n\nParty: Republican\n\nScott has been a senator since 2019, and he served as state governor before his time in the upper chamber. Scott is a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was tasked as chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee with securing a victory for the party in the midterms. Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is challenging Scott.\n\nHawaii\n\nMazie Hirono\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHirono, running for reelection in 2024, was the first Asian American woman to be elected a U.S. senator. She first won her seat in 2012 and has spent much of her tenure in the chamber working on legislation addressing immigration, the environment and veterans affairs.\n\nIndiana\n\nMike Braun\n\nParty: Republican\n\nBraun, who won his Senate seat in 2018, is opting to run for governor in his state rather than seek a second term. The race to replace Braun includes Republican Rep. Jim Banks and former Democratic State Rep. Marc Carmichael.\n\nMaine\n\nAngus King\n\nParty: Independent\n\nKing is running for reelection in 2024. One of just three independents in the Senate, he has held the seat since 2013.\n\nMaryland\n\nBen Cardin\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCardin, who has been in office since 2007, announced in May he would not seek reelection. Since the announcement, a slew of candidates have indicated they plan to run in the Democratic primary in Maryland, including Rep. David Trone and Angela Alsobrooks, the county executive of Prince George's County. Former Gov. Larry Hogan will run on the Republican side.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nElizabeth Warren\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nOne-time presidential hopeful and Senate veteran Elizabeth Warren is running to keep her seat in 2024. She has served as senator for ten years.\n\nMichigan\n\nDebbie Stabenow\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nStabenow, who has been in the Senate since 2001, announced plans to retire in early January, opening up a seat in a critical battleground state. In the Democratic primary to replace her, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is widely considered the frontrunner, though businessman Nasser Beydoun and actor Hill Harper have also declared candidacies. On the Republican side, many are tossing their hats into the ring. Republican candidates include former Reps. Justin Amash, Peter Meijer and Mike Rogers, businessmen Michael Hoover, Glenn Wilson, J.D. Wilson and Sandy Pensler, State Board of Education member Nikki Snyder, physician and pastor Sherry O'Donnell, physician Bensson Samuel, educator Sharon Savage and attorney Alexandria Taylor.\n\nMinnesota\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKlobuchar, who rose to national fame during her 2020 bid for the presidency, has been a Minnesota senator since 2007 and is the first woman to be elected by the state to the Senate. She is running for reelection.\n\nMississippi\n\nRoger Wicker\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWicker has been the state's senator since 2007 and will run again in 2024. He serves as the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\nMissouri\n\nJosh Hawley\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFamous in part for holding up a fist in support of rioters outside the capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Hawley forms part of a growing conservative flank of the GOP. He will run for reelection in 2024.\n\nMontana\n\nJon Tester\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nA Democrat in a deeply red state, Tester has held his Senate seat since 2007. He is expected to face a tough challenge from the right in 2024 as Republicans battle to regain a majority in the U.S. Senate. After U.S. Rep. Matthew M. Rosendale dropped out, Tester's likely opponent is GOP nominee Tim Sheehy, a businessman and veteran with a Trump endorsement.\n\nNebraska\n\nDeb Fischer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nFischer has represented Nebraska in the Senate since the 2012 midterms and is seeking reelection.\n\nNevada\n\nJacky Rosen\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nRosen, who has already announced her reelection bid for 2024, has held her seat since 2019. Nevada is a fiercely divided state and forms part of a challenging electoral map for Democrats. Army veteran Sam Brown is challenging Rosen in what may be a tight race, based on recent polls.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRobert Menendez\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nMenendez has held his Senate seat since 2006. He has not ruled out running for reelection but faces harsh criticism from his own party after he was charged with accepting bribes and obstructing justice. Other Democratic candidates include New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy and Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMartin Heinrich\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nHeinrich, who has held his seat since 2013, will run again in 2024. He launched his campaign for a third term with a video touching on gun safety and the importance of a transition to clean energy.\n\nNew York\n\nKirsten Gillibrand\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nGillibrand has become a mainstay of New York politics, holding her Senate seat since 2009. She is running for reelection. New York Republicans have tapped Mike Sapraicone, a private security executive, to run against Gillibrand.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nKevin Cramer\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCramer, who won his seat in 2018, will seek reelection this year. Cramer was a close ally of Trump during the former president's term in office, but has since voiced support for a possible replacement on the 2024 GOP ticket. Katrina Christiansen, an assistant engineering professor at the University of Jamestown, is vying for the seat from the Democratic side.\n\nOhio\n\nSherrod Brown\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nBrown, who first won in 2006, is a prominent target for Republicans in 2024. He occupies a swing state seat they see as a possible pick-up in their quest to regain control of the chamber. Republican state Sen. Matt Dolan is running along with businessman Bernie Moreno and GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBob Casey\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCasey was first elected in 2006. Though he represents a swing state identified by Republicans as an ideal win in 2024, he is considered a tough candidate to beat. The son of former Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. he is widely popular in the state, especially with swaths of voters other Democrats have begun to struggle with attracting. Former business executive David McCormick is challenging Casey.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSheldon Whitehouse\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nWhitehouse, who has been in the Senate for a little under a decade, is running for a fourth term. He will face a challenge on the right from Raymond McKay, a veteran and the former president of the Rhode Island Republican Assembly, and Republican State Rep. Patricia Morgan.\n\nTennessee\n\nMarsha Blackburn\n\nParty: Republican\n\nElected in 2018, Blackburn has become a prominent voice among conservatives, particularly on culture war issues. She has announced plans to seek reelection, but will face a prominent challenge on the left.\n\nState Rep. Gloria Johnson, who entered the national spotlight when she was nearly expelled from the state legislature for holding a protest on the House floor against gun violence, will run. Two of her colleagues, Democratic Reps. Justin Jones of Nashville and Justin Pearson of Memphis were briefly expelled for the same action. Joining her in the primary is Marquita Bradshaw, an activist for environmental justice who mounted an unsuccessful bid for Senate in 2020.\n\nTexas\n\nTed Cruz\n\nParty: Republican\n\nCruz, a political firebrand for his party and a two-time presidential candidate, successfully battled off a challenge from Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke in 2018. For 2024, he may have to do the same. Democratic Rep. Collin Allred, a former NFL player, won the recent Senate primary and will face Cruz in November.\n\nUtah\n\nMitt Romney\n\nParty: Republican\n\nOne-time presidential nominee for the GOP, Romney has come to occupy a minority in recent years, treading a more centrist, anti-Trump line. He has held his Senate seat since 2019, but is not running for reelection in 2024. Many hopefuls are vying for his seat, notably Rep. John Curtis and Brent Orrin Hatch, the son of the late Orrin G. Hatch, a former Utah senator.\n\nVermont\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nParty: Independent\n\nSanders, a famously outspoken member of the Senate's left flank, has been in office since 2007 and is running for reelection this year. He is one of the chamber's few independents but often votes on a party line with Democrats.\n\nVirginia\n\nTim Kaine\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nKaine, the vice presidential candidate on Hillary Clinton's ticket in 2016, has represented Virginia in the Senate since 2013. For Democrats who face a tough electoral map in 2024, his race is a must-win. Though Kaine is a veteran of Virginia politics, and the state tends to lean blue, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin's win in 2021 proved a red tilt is not far off.\n\nRepublican hopefuls include veterans Eddie Garcia and Hung Cao and former Ron DeSantis advisor Scott Parkinson.\n\nWashington\n\nMaria Cantwell\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nCantwell has been in the Senate for over two decades, first winning election in 2000. Cantwell is running for reelection.

Behind the scenes, the Biden campaign machine switched gears to benefit the vice president.\n\nTrump, 78, reckoned with a new November opponent, one almost 20 years his junior, as some Democratic donors celebrated what one called the \"shot of adrenaline\" Harris could bring to the pivotal race.\n\n\"Now we have to start all over again,\" Trump complained in a Truth Social post Sunday evening.\n\nFollow along with USA TODAY's updates.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nSenate fundraising arm triples individual donations\n\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tripled its fundraising record for the cycle in “individual grassroots” donations in a single day on Sunday, a DSCC aide told USA TODAY, though they did not provide exact fundraising numbers.\n\nOther major fundraising arms, including the House’s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, are reporting big fundraising hauls the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nDifferent biographies\n\nTo make her case against former President Donald Trump, Harris, in a visit to her new campaign headquarters, sought to highlight their sharp biographical differences.\n\n\"As a young prosecutor, when I was in the Alameda County District Attorney's office in California, I specialized in cases involving sexual abuse,” said Harris, a former prosecutor. \"Donald Trump was found liable by a jury for committing sexual abuse.”\n\nHarris continued: “As attorney General of California, I took on one of our country's largest for-profit colleges and put it out of business. Donald Trump ran a for-profit college, Trump University, that was forced to pay $25 million to the students it scammed.\"\n\nSimilar to Biden’s agenda, Harris vowed to fight for “reproductive freedom” if elected, take action to ban assault weapons and work to pass the John Lewis voting rights bill, among other policies.\n\n“Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. We here know when our middle class is strong, America is strong.

While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nArizona: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Biden-Trump race, an InsiderAdvantage poll showed 9% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nGeorgia: An exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMichigan: Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President.\n\nNevada: Polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released. In a Trump-Biden poll that offered a hypothetical matchup against Harris, Trump received 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%\n\nNorth Carolina: There are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump.\n\nPennsylvania: No current polls show Harris-Trump results but before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump.\n\nWisconsin: A Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error.\n\n-Maya Homan\n\nHarris fundraising boom continues, campaign says\n\nThe Harris campaign announced $81 million in donations in the 24 hours since the vice president announced her bid Sunday.\n\nThis number includes money raised through the campaign, the Democratic National Committee and joint fundraising committees.\n\n“The historic outpouring of support for Vice President Harris represents exactly the kind of grassroots energy and enthusiasm that wins elections,” Kevin Munoz, campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with Democratic lawmakers, major donors had raised concerns about Biden following his debate performance and threatened to withhold their financial support if the president continued toward the nomination.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nSenate Republican campaign arm hits Harris\n\nThe National Republican Senate Committee, the fundraising arm for Senate Republicans, released a messaging memo to candidates Monday titled: \"Harris creates strong down-ballot opportunity.\"\n\nThe group argues that the case against Biden − that he was \"mentally unfit to hold office\" − didn't work well against down-ballot Democrats. But Harris \"owns the Biden Administration's baggage,\" they write, making her \"arguably a bigger threat to Democrats' Senate majority than Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe memo details Harris' policy positions and concludes with a section titled \"weird,\" including noting that she laughs at \"inappropriate moments\" and loves Venn diagrams.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nKamala Harris quickly securing votes to become Democratic nominee\n\nA USA TODAY count of delegates shows the 59-year old Harris is more than 40% of the way to the 1,968 delegates needed to become the party's nominee in the first round of voting. There are 3,936 Democratic delegates in total, including former presidents, state and local party leaders, members of Congress and governors.\n\nAfter announcing Sunday afternoon that he no longer sought the nomination, the 81-year-old Biden endorsed Harris, a move that likely inspired delegates pledged to him to endorse her.\n\nIt will ultimately be up to the delegates to pick the nominee, but it remains unclear whether that decision will come by a remote roll call vote early next month as was originally planned by the party or at the Democratic National Convention that's scheduled to run August 19-22 in Chicago.\n\n-- Sarah D. Wire and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nSchumer, Jeffries praise Harris in statement, stop short of endorsing\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries released a joint statement Monday saying that Harris is \"off to a great start\" with her pledge to pursue the nomination \"in a manner consistent with the grassroots and transparent process\" set forth by the DNC.\n\nHarris is \"rapidly\" gaining support from delegates, they said, but stopped short of endorsing her for president themselves.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nVance mocks Harris over debate\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance is already taking more than a few shots at Harris, including her debate skills.\n\n\"I was told I was gonna get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's gonna get to debate her?!\" Vance said during a homecoming speech in Ohio.\n\nHe added: \"I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nJeffries, Schumer to meet with Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris \"shortly,\" Jeffries told reporters Monday.\n\nThere's no exact time for that meeting yet, he said, but they're waiting for Schumer to get back into town. The Senate doesn't return until Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm excited for that meeting,\" Jeffries said when asked why he has not yet endorsed Harris for president, as many of his high-profile Democratic colleagues have. Harris \"has excited the community, she's excited the House Democratic Caucus, and she's exciting the country.\"\n\nHe said he and Schumer will have more to say about \"the path forward\" once that meeting is over.\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nPelosi backs Harris as the vice president locks up congressional support\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., endorsed Kamala Harris on Monday as she continues to pick up key support from Democratic lawmakers.\n\n“Today, it is with immense pride and limitless optimism for our country’s future that I endorse Vice President Kamala Harris,” Pelosi said in a statement. “My enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris for president is official, personal and political.”\n\nPelosi played a key role in Biden’s eventual exit from the race. The former speaker served as a sounding board for Democratic lawmakers who were concerned with Biden’s campaign. Her comments on Biden that were hardly enthusiastic endorsements of Biden over the past weeks gave the green light to Democrats to publicly come out against the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?'

You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.\"\n\nNo, that isn't a quote from an ancient philosopher or a classic author. It's from Kamala Harris.\n\nAs rumors swirled in recent weeks over Joe Biden's ability to win and complete a second term in office, and following the recent news of him stepping down as the Democratic nominee, Harris (as well as the internet-famous coconut tree) has drawn increased interest in the political sphere as voters look to her as Biden's potential replacement on the Democratic side of the ticket.\n\n− Emily DeLetter\n\nHarris celebrates student athletes at the White House\n\nHarris on Monday spoke at an event celebrating college athletes, her first public appearance since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nNCAA Sports Day brings championship teams from the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the White House.

In one term, he has already surpassed the legacy of most presidents who have served two terms in office,\" Harris said during an NCAA event at the White House.\n\nSaid she first met Joe Biden through his son Beau Biden. Beau Biden was the attorney general of Delaware while Harris served in the same role in California. Beau Biden died from brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"Back then, Beau would often tell me stories about his dad. He would talk about the kind of father and the kind of man that Joe Biden is,\" Harris said. \"The qualities that Beau revered in his father are the same qualities that I have seen every day in our president. His honesty, his integrity, his commitment to his faith and his family. His big heart and his deep love of our country.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nFlorida Democrats endorse Harris\n\nSamuel Vilchez, chair of the Orange County Democratic Party in Florida, said in a press call Monday that the Florida Democratic National Committee is endorsing Harris.\n\n“I’m thrilled to announce a unanimous endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris by the Florida Democratic National Committee members, all 15 of us, we have come together and a resounding show of unity and purpose to stand with (the) Vice President.”\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nKamala Harris expected in Delaware Monday afternoon\n\nKamala Harris, who Joe Biden endorsed Sunday after announcing he will no longer seek reelection, is coming to Delaware, according to U.S. Sen.

He's been in Rehoboth Beach battling his latest round of COVID and is expected to address the nation later this week regarding his decision to bow out of the presidential race.\n\n– Isabel Hughes and Esteban Parra\n\nTrump's strategy (so far): Link Harris to Biden\n\nThe Trump campaign is making its opening bid in the new campaign against Harris: Linking her to Biden.\n\n\"Harris will be even WORSE for the people of our Nation than Joe Biden,\" said a memo from Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, describing the vice president as an \"enabler\" for Biden.\n\n\"They own each other’s records, and there is no distance between the two.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nInside KamalaHQ: How Harris quickly began plotting campaign after Biden's shocking exit\n\nKamala Harris was at the vice president’s residence when she got the call from POTUS.

But with Biden exiting the race Sunday and endorsing Kamala Harris, the debate schedule may not go on as planned.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Sunday evening, Trump called for Fox News to host the debate, rather than “Fake News ABC.”\n\n“Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC,” he wrote.\n\nABC News has not issued an update on the debate schedule.\n\n– Maya Homan\n\nAs Biden leaves 2024 election, Trump and Democrats need to court these 10 voter groups\n\nPresident Joe Biden's announcement Sunday that he's dropping out and backing Vice President Kamala Harris shakes up the 2024 presidential election in many ways. Perhaps most significantly: Biden's decision could bring millions more voters to the polls, according to a new analysis of the U.S. electorate.\n\nResonate, a consumer data and intelligence company, released exclusively to USA TODAY a new set of 10 distinct voter groups. From its database of 250 million Americans, the 10 groups emerged as company's AI data engine culled and matched thousands of U.S. voter attributes.\n\nEricka McCoy, chief marketing officer for Resonate, predicted Friday that a new Democratic nominee would likely reenergize Gen-Z Zealots, based on insights from these groups.

Biden had been under intense pressure to step aside after a poor performance in a June debate against former President Donald Trump that highlighted concerns about his age.\n\nWhile diplomatic protocol tends to limit what American allies will say in public about an active U.S. election, many international officials applauded what Biden had, in their view, done to give new energy to the NATO military alliance, his administration's support for Ukraine and for democratic principles around the world.\n\n− Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nBiden news leaves some voters feeling panicked.

Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., who was shot and severely injured at a public event in 2011.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump knocks Biden on Truth Social\n\nWhile the rest of the political world tries to figure out the new realities, Trump took to social media to mock Biden for pulling out of the presidential race.\n\n\"He loses the Debate badly, then panics, and makes mistake after mistake, is told he can’t win, and decide they will pick another candidate, probably Harris,\" Trump said in a series of Truth Social posts. \"They stole the race from Biden after he won it in the primaries - A First!\"\n\nQuestions surrounding Biden's candidacy spiked after his disastrous debate performance against Trump last month. He did win Democratic primaries across the country earlier this year.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTop Democratic leaders come out for Harris\n\nHouse Democratic Whip Katherine Clark D-Mass., and House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 2 and No. 3 ranking House Democrats, respectively, endorsed Harris on Monday morning.\n\n“While Donald Trump campaigns on dividing the American people and rigging the system for the rich, Kamala Harris will grow the economy by growing the middle class and defend our core principles of democracy and justice for all,” Clark said in a statement.\n\nAguilar said in a statement he will “do everything I can to elect Kamala Harris the 47th President of the United States.”\n\nHarris is quickly locking up support from congressional Democrats for her campaign. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has yet to weigh in though.– Ken Tran\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear endorses Harris\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear suggested Monday he would be open to joining the Democratic presidential ticket as Harris’ running mate.\n\n“If somebody calls you on that, what you do is at least listen,” Beshear said during an interview on MSNBC’s \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nBeshear, often mentioned as a potential candidate for president or vice president, endorsed Harris for president and pledged to do everything he can to support her. Harris “is smart and strong, which will make her a good president,” he said, “but she's also kind and has empathy, which can make her a great president. The contrast between her and those running on the other side couldn't be clearer.”\n\nBeshear, who is in second term as Kentucky governor, said while it’s flattering to be mentioned as a possible vice presidential candidate, “the only way I would consider something other than this current job is if I believed I could further help my people and to help this country.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nHunter Biden shares emotional post on his father\n\nHunter Biden, son of Joe Biden, gave an emotional tribute to his father after he dropped out of the 2024 presidential race Sunday.\n\n“For my entire life, I've looked at my dad in awe. How could he suffer so much heartache and yet give so much of whatever remained of his heart to others?” Hunter Biden wrote. “Not only in the policies he passed, but in the individual lives he's touched.”\n\nHe said that over a lifetime, he’s seen his father “absorb the pain of countless everyday Americans who he's given his personal phone number to, because he wanted them to call him when they were hurting.”\n\n“That unconditional love has been his North Star as a President, and as a parent. He is unique in public life today in that there is no distance between Joe Biden the man and Joe Biden the public servant of the last 54 years,” Hunter Biden wrote. “I'm so lucky every night I get to tell him I love him, and to thank him.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Gavin Newsom?\n\nGavin Newsom has served as California governor since 2019.\n\nNewsom had been seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace Biden, until the 56-year-old came out in support of Harris Sunday evening. Now, he’s on the rumored list for running mate and is expected to play a major role in rallying Democratic voters around the vice president.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nIs Michelle Obama running for president?\n\nNo, former first lady Michelle Obama is not running.\n\nShe’s said previously that she’s not interested in running for the position. In a statement to NBC News in March, before Biden dropped out, her office said that, “As former First Lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president. Mrs. Obama supports President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ re-election campaign.”\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRead President Joe Biden's full statement as he drops out of 2024 presidential race\n\nYou can read Joe Biden's statement on dropping out in full here.\n\n−James Powel\n\nWho is Josh Shapiro?\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro took office January 2023, after serving as Pennsylvania’s attorney general and as a state representative.\n\nThe 51-year-old has been floated as a possible running mate for Harris given his appeal in a battleground state – counter to Trump’s VP and Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow old is Donald Trump?\n\nTrump is 78 years old. He is currently the oldest candidate running for president, after Biden dropped out of the race. He formally received the GOP nomination last week at the Republican convention.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is the next presidential debate?\n\nThat's complicated. Before Joe Biden's decision to step down, he and Donald Trump agreed to debate on Tuesday, September 10.\n\nHowever, that date could change with Biden's exit from the 2024 election and Harris launching her campaign.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat is Kamala Harris' approval rating?\n\nAccording to a 538 average of polls, Kamala Harris has a disapproval rating of 50.4% and an approval rating of 38.6%. Still, those numbers are based on Americans' attitude toward Harris before she launched her second presidential bid, so they could change in the coming weeks and months.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Biden's exit the latest episode of the 'worst reality TV show in the world'?\n\nIn Oakland, Calfornia, grocery store checker Erica Guthrie burst into tears when she heard the news. In Philadelphia, the Rev. Carl Day says we're living in \"the worst reality TV show in the world right now.\"\n\nAnd in Colorado, stormchaser Jen Walton wants a vacation \"from unprecedented times.\"\n\nAfter months of a seemingly inevitable clash between two long-known and well-understood presidential candidates, President Joe Biden's Sunday decision to halt his reelection effort upended both the campaign and the day-to-day lives of Americans still reeling from the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump the weekend before.\n\nIt all comes atop years of nonstop political turmoil, and many Americans say they're exhausted, excited, anxious and baffled, sometimes all at once.\n\n− Trevor Hughes, Terry Collins and Lauren Villagran\n\nJoe Manchin says he won’t run for president\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says he won’t seek the Democratic nomination for president.\n\nManchin, an independent who left the Democratic Party in May, reportedly had considered registering again as a Democrat and seeking the party’s presidential nomination after Biden announce he won’t run for a second term.\n\nBut Manchin told CBS News on Monday he’s not running. “I’m not going to be a candidate for president…,” he said. “I don’t need that in my life.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nMore:Biden's legacy: Triumphs, heartbreaks and a turbulent finale\n\nIs Kamala Harris eligible to run for president?\n\nYes, Harris is eligible to run for president.\n\nShe fulfills all the requirements needed to run for president, which is that a candidate must be 35 years or older, a natural born U.S. citizen and a resident of the U.S. for 14 years. Harris is 59 years old and she was born in California.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHow does Harris fare against Trump in the polls?\n\nSome polls show Harris beating Trump by one or two points and others showing her almost neck in neck with the former president.\n\nA Washington Post/ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted between July 5 and July 9, found that 49% of registered voters would choose Harris while 47% would choose Trump.\n\nBut an NBC News poll conducted after the debate found Trump leading Harris 47% to 45% among registered voters. Likewise, a Fox News poll conducted between July 7 and July 10 found that 48% of registered voters would choose Harris if the election were held today compared to 49% for Trump.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nBiden Cabinet members praise his leadership\n\nTwo of President Biden’s Cabinet secretaries – Attorney General Merrick Garland and Alejandro Mayorkas, secretary of Homeland Secretary – praised his leadership for following the rule of law and protecting the country.\n\nThe praise contrasted with years of Republican attacks against Biden and his administration. Republicans have investigated the president’s son, Hunter Biden, who was convicted of gun charges and who still faces tax charges. Biden didn’t block the prosecutions.\n\nBiden sat for an interview with a special counsel for investigated how classified documents were found at his home and former office. Republicans are fighting for the recording of the interview, despite the Justice Department releasing the transcript.\n\n“From the beginning of his tenure, President Biden has made clear in both word and deed that he stands for the rule of law and for the Justice Department’s critical mission to protect the safety and the civil rights of everyone in our country,” said Garland, who was held in contempt by the House after refusing to release the recording.\n\nRepublicans have also accused the administration of weakening border security, allowing unprecedented waves of undocumented immigrants to enter. But Mayorkas said the country and world are better for Biden’s leadership in protecting the American people.\n\n“When it comes to homeland security, he has taken and directed bold, innovative, and decisive actions to help safeguard our communities, secure our borders, harness the power of artificial intelligence, advance our cybersecurity, eradicate the scourge of fentanyl, and more – all while standing up for our nation’s values,” said Mayorkas, who was impeached by the House over border security. “It is a privilege to advance his vision of and for a strong, secure, and prosperous America.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nHarris is frontrunner to become Democratic nominee\n\nThe Democratic Party won’t officially name its presidential nominee until its convention in August, but Harris is the immediate frontrunner.\n\nBiden, who chosen Harris as his vice presidential running mate four years ago, emphatically endorsed her to be the party’s nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nSome other prominent Democrats also endorsed her, including Bill and Hillary Clinton. Others, including Barack Obama, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued statements lauding Biden but without explicitly endorsing Harris to succeed him.\n\nHarris, however, has several advantages. She has already been vetted for national office during her tenure as Biden’s second-in-command. She has also been a part of Biden’s reelection apparatus for months.\n\n–Karissa Waddick and Michael Collins\n\nDelegates will pick Democratic nominee\n\nBiden endorsed Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president, but it’s the party’s 3,896 delegates who will pick their candidate.\n\nDelegates can vote for someone other than Biden even if he won their states’ primaries earlier this year.\n\nThat's possible because of a section in the DNC rules referred to as the \"good conscience\" clause, which states delegates shall \"in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them.\" The word “sentiment” is where much of the delegates' support will hinge and opens the door to interpretation.\n\nSo delegates could vote for Biden, Harris or someone else. There is no system to automatically transfer the delegates from Biden to Harris.\n\n–Kathryn Palmer and Michael Collins\n\nSecond gentleman Douglas Emhoff: Biden 'a true patriot'\n\nHarris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff, has offered his thoughts on Biden’s withdrawal from the race.\n\n“I am deeply grateful to @POTUS and @FLOTUS for their years of friendship and support,” the second gentleman wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “President Biden is a true patriot who leads our nation with honesty, decency, and integrity. Alongside @VP, they have fought tirelessly for families and communities, delivering for Americans across our nation. I am so proud of their accomplishments and thankful for their leadership.”\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nJD Vance slams Biden and Harris\n\nTrump’s running mate J.D. Vance criticized Biden's and Harris’ tenure in office in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe Ohio senator, 39, called Biden the “worst” president of his lifetime and said Harris “has been right there with him every step of the way.”\n\n“President Trump and I are ready to save America, whoever's at the top of the Democrat ticket.

Kennedy Jr. praised Biden for stepping out of the 2024 race.\n\n“His infirmities were evident to any unbiased observer from the beginning,\" Kennedy said on social media. \"It was this progressive deterioration — and his abandonment of Democratic Party principles — that prompted me to enter the race and ensure American voters had a viable, vigorous alternative to Donald Trump.”\n\nHe also called on the Democratic Party to “return to its traditional commitment to democracy and exemplify it with an open process.”\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen will Biden address the nation?\n\nAmericans can expect to hear more from Biden in the coming days, the president said in his announcement withdrawing from the race.\n\n\"I will speak to the nation later this week in more to detail about my decision,\" he wrote.\n\nHe did not give an exact date or time.\n\n− Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nWhen is the DNC?

Tom Carper in the Democratic primary this fall.\n\nIf she succeeds, she would make history as the state's first biracial lesbian woman to serve in Congress.\n\nBut Harris, an Air Force veteran who has struggled to make ends meet and finish her college degree, prefers not to be pigeonholed.\n\n\"The bigger history I'm going for is to represent everybody,\" the 38-year-old mother of two said this week.\n\nHarris plans to officially kick off her campaign at 11 a.m. Feb. 10 at an event at the Chris White Gallery at the Shipley Artists Lofts in downtown Wilmington.\n\nLast week, the state's political insiders were abuzz after news of a mystery Carper challenger surfaced on Facebook — one who supports a $15 minimum wage, single-payer health care and universal pre-kindergarten.\n\nMystery solved.\n\nHarris co-founded the Delaware Civil Rights Coalition on the eve of President Donald Trump's inauguration. Consisting of about a dozen civil rights and religious organizations, the group works to combat broad attacks on women, Muslims, African-Americans and the LGBTQ community.\n\nWhile Harris' agenda firmly aligns with that of progressive Democrats, she refuses to characterize her upcoming battle as one of progressive versus moderate ideology.\n\nRather, the state Human Relations commissioner who has lobbied Carper's office on a range of issues, criticized him as a disconnected career politician who continues to vote against Delaware residents' best interests to the benefit of corporate donors.\n\n\"I know we're all looking for all the same things,\" she said of First State voters. \"Almost all of our hardships are simply because of the way our structure is set against us.\"\n\nHarris is aware of the grueling path ahead. She is only the second Democrat to challenge Carper in a primary since he was first elected to the Senate in 2000, upending longtime Republican Sen. William V. Roth Jr.\n\nKnown for playing the godfather role in state politics, Carper has served as Delaware's treasurer, congressman, governor and senior senator during his more than four decades in public service.\n\nState leaders here wear with pride the \"Carper Democrat\" badge; they tend to be socially liberal, but centrists on taxes, the economy and fiscal policy.\n\nIn 2012, the last time Carper's seat was in play, Keith Spanarelli, an independent-minded former business owner, earned only 12 percent of the vote. Carper later sailed to his 13th consecutive statewide victory — a Delaware record — defeating Republican Kevin Ward, Independent Alex Pires and the Green Party's Andrew Groff.\n\nCarper's campaign committee raised nearly $4.9 million in contributions in that election, dwarfing his opponents' war chests, according to campaign finance records.\n\nAlso entering the race this year is first-time Republican candidate Chuck Boyce, who announced last spring. A Middletown businessman, Boyce has pledged to help veterans through an improved Veterans Affairs system and by creating more jobs for Delawareans in expanding industries.\n\n\"It's time Delaware sends someone with private sector experience to D.C., who understands the struggles of being an employer and will fight on the side of America's workforce,\" Boyce said.\n\nJesse Chadderdon, executive director of the state Democratic Party, said he and others had heard rumblings about Harris entering the race. But she never talked to the party directly.\n\nAs the party brings in new voices reflective of Delaware's diverse population, Chadderdon expects several crowded primaries this year, including races for state attorney general and auditor. So far, no Democrat has emerged to challenge U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, who is also up for re-election.\n\nIt's still too early to know whether the Delaware Democratic Executive Committee will formally endorse a candidate in the Carper race. Breaking with tradition, the party declined to endorse candidates in 2016 in statewide primaries for Congress, lieutenant governor and insurance commissioner, citing a packed field of qualified candidates.\n\nSTORY: More Democrats enter race for Delaware attorney general\n\nSTORY: Former Catholic priest charged in child rape case\n\nEven with President Donald Trump's win in 2016, Delawareans mostly stuck with incumbents and career public service workers. In the last state election, only one of the four GOP candidates challenging a Democratic incumbent won: Anthony Delcollo, who defeated Senate President Pro Tempore Patricia Blevins.\n\nAt the same time, the state has grappled with a budget deficit in the hundreds of millions of dollars, an opioid crisis, calls for comprehensive school reform and the loss of major employers.\n\nChadderdon promised a fair process for all candidates involved this year. He praised Carper's long and distinguished service to Delaware, adding \"there is a reason that he's one of the most successful politicians in our state's history.\"\n\nCarper, who at 71 says he still runs 8 miles before church on Sunday, doesn't view his establishment brand of politics as a liability. He typically votes along party lines but stressed that voters appreciate his reputation as a consensus-builder and advocate for clean air, affordable health care, infrastructure development and sound fiscal governance.\n\nYet he also doesn't see himself as an invincible candidate.\n\n\"Every campaign I’ve ever had, I always run like I’m 20 points behind,\" he said recently. \"I also kill them with kindness.”\n\nAs the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Carper has a long record of support for anti-pollution legislation and action on climate change. He has also demonstrated steadfast and impassioned opposition to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt.\n\nHarris, who opposes fracking and offshore drilling, criticized Carper for supporting the construction of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which prompted environmentalists in 2014 to stage a sit-in at his Washington office.\n\nCarper has consistently argued that the pipeline impasse had delayed movement on other clean-air issues.\n\n\"One vote out of 1,000 or more,\" he said. \"Give me a break.\"\n\nA staunch supporter of the Affordable Care Act, Carper has worked relentlessly to block GOP health care bills. Yet he and U.S. Sen. Chris Coons were among 13 Democrats last year who opposed a measure that would have allowed pharmaceutical distributors and pharmacists to import low-cost medicine from Canada and other countries.\n\nBoth Carper and Coons, who count the pharmaceutical industry among their major donors, cited drug safety concerns.\n\nWhile serving as Delaware's governor, Carper was instrumental in bringing AstraZeneca to Fairfax, offering a $40.7 million package of grants and tax credits along with $70 million in road improvements in exchange for the company's pledge to create more jobs.\n\nLast month, Carper and Coons were among six Democrats who voted to confirm Trump nominee Alex Azar, a former drug company executive, as secretary of Health and Human Services. Azar, who has described the Affordable Care Act as a \"fundamentally broken system,\" has promised to work on lowering drug prices.\n\nPreviously, Carper voted against multiple Trump Cabinet nominees, but he considers Azar qualified for the job. He cited Azar's work as HHS general counsel during the George W. Bush administration. Coons, who attended Yale Law School with Azar, also vouched for him, Carper said.\n\nHarris said she would have voted against Azar. She also criticized Carper for opposing legislation that would have prevented the government shutdown last month.\n\nThree days later, Carper and other Senate Democrats voted to reopen the government and fund it through Feb. 8 while both parties continued to negotiate a deal on immigration and spending issues.\n\n\"One way we can bring pressure to bear is to do the morally right thing,\" Carper said, adding that young undocumented immigrants deserve protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nHarris said she also supports DACA and easing other immigrants' path to citizenship, but she depends on her veterans benefits and nearly lost her home during the last government shutdown.\n\nAfter serving for eight years in the military, Harris said she retired as an Air Force staff sergeant in 2008 because of medical complications from an anthrax vaccine.\n\nSoon after, she assembled a varied résumé that included lawn mower, fried chicken cook, acupuncturist, auto body mechanic and manager of a leadership program for former gang members. She recalls attending corporate luncheons where executives reported record profits while workers' wages stagnated.\n\n\"You can't treat people poorly and expect them to perform at peak levels when their worlds are falling apart,\" she said. \"There's a miseducation throughout the state of Delaware. People are voting against their best interest.\"\n\nA Delaware resident off and on for 15 years, Harris now works as a community organizer for left-leaning advocacy groups and directs the Achievement Matters program at the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League, which helps reduce the achievement gap for middle-school students on Wilmington's Eastside. She is also pursuing a bachelor's degree in nonprofit management from Wilmington University.\n\nLast summer, Harris broached the topic of her political aspirations with her 6-year-old daughter.\n\n\"We're going to save the world again, right Momma?\" the girl replied.\n\nCarper, a Navy veteran and father of two adult sons who is known for his lengthy narratives, also credited his family and hundreds of Delaware supporters for persuading him to run for a fourth Senate term.\n\nIf he succeeds, is retirement on the horizon?\n\nThe soft-spoken senator quotes a song by the Rolling Stones.\n\n\"This could be the last time. Maybe the last time I don't know.\"\n\n\"When (Delaware voters) get tired of me,\" he added, \"they’ll let me know.”\n\nThis story includes information from USA Today.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/02"}]}

The practice has been part of an ongoing debate about measuring student achievement.\n\nThe state requires that annual appraisals of educators include how well student scores grew on the state standardized test if they teach a subject included on that exam. But Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, chairman of the House Education Committee, said the system is too narrowly focused and doesn't accurately reflect the abilities of the educator.\n\n\"In the NFL, when a team goes to draft a player, they don't look at one game and make a decision based on that,\" he said. \"They evaluate them over the course of a long time.\"\n\nJaques sponsored legislation that would change the assessment system so that principals and teachers would work together to set their own goals, based on a combination of benchmarks approved by the state Department of Education. Test scores could be one of the measurements selected.\n\nJaques says teachers will still need to objectively show they helped students grow, but he hopes to shift the focus to long-term performance rather than the results of one make-or-break exam.\n\nThe bill passed Jaques' committee last week and is scheduled to be heard in the House on Tuesday.\n\nUnder the plan, the changes would start with a two-year pilot program in at least three places: a school district, a vo-tech district and a charter school. After that, the Legislature could choose to implement the new system statewide.\n\nSTORY: Virtually no Delaware teachers receive poor evaluations\n\nSTORY: Colonial creates its own evaluations\n\nState Department of Education spokeswoman Alison May in a statement said state officials \"expressed some concerns to the sponsor\" and is glad that the state is starting with a pilot.\n\n\"We agree the system should be improved, but have concerns that this bill will make the student achievement component, and the whole evaluation, less useful in identifying the most effective teaching practices as well as areas in which educators need more support,\" May said.\n\nMay said the department was open to changes like excluding the test scores of students who miss more than 15 percent of class time.\n\nDelaware's largest teacher union supports the bill.\n\n\"This really focuses on the student as a whole, not just a test score,\" said Jackie Kook, a Christina School District teacher and a member of the Delaware State Education Association. \"The test score is easy because it is uniform, but it doesn't reflect all the many things we do.\"\n\nKook chaired the subcommittee of educators and administrators that developed the proposals in Jaques' bill. She said different students have different needs, which means not every school and teacher is focused on the same kind of instruction.\n\nFor a teacher whose main goal is improving school attendance or social skills, for example, the standardized test does little to measure whether a student improved, Kook said.\n\n\"We recognize that there has to be some way for kids to demonstrate that they're getting it and they're growing at an acceptable level,\" she said. \"But what we're saying is, let's look at the whole picture.\"\n\nThe state has placed a hold on using statewide test scores in evaluations because of the transition to the complicated new Smarter Balanced test. Jaques said he is asking the state Department of Education to extend that moratorium through the two-year pilot.\n\nThe state evaluation system has five parts. The fifth part, which measures student growth and features test scores, has a bigger impact than the other four on the final rating.\n\nJaques' bill would make all five components of equal weight.\n\nDelaware began to factor growth on test scores into the state assessment in 2012. Many teachers protested, saying test scores can be influenced by other factors like poverty, special needs and family circumstances.\n\nBut for all the controversy, almost no educators got bad ratings under the system. DPAS-II gave administrators leeway to adjust scores in many cases, and principals almost always chose to \"bump up\" evaluations when possible.\n\nIn the 2012-2013 school year, only 14 educators were rated ineffective. The year after that, only nine were rated ineffective.\n\nState law permits districts and charter schools to create their own teacher evaluation systems, though until recently few schools took advantage of that.\n\nLast year, the Colonial School District unveiled its own evaluation system that features more frequent classroom observations. That's similar to models that more than a dozen individual charter schools have implemented.\n\n[Editor's note: If you do not see a poll question here, please refresh this page.]\n\nSo-called \"high-stakes testing\" has been one of the most fiercely debated issues in education across the country. Many states that have tied test scores to educator evaluations have faced an outcry from teachers and the unions that represent them.\n\nDelaware agreed to add tough measures of student growth when it accepted a massive federal Race to the Top grant in 2010, and leaders in the U.S. Department of Education often pushed states to use test scores to judge teachers during the era of the No Child Left Behind law.\n\nBut Race to the Top ran its course and Congress passed a new law to replace No Child Left Behind, leaving federal officials with less authority to pressure states into relying on standardized tests.\n\n\"We've got more flexibility to do things the way we think they ought to be done,\" Jaques said. \"And we're going to use that.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.\n\nCongress approves rewrite of K-12 education law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/08/09/christina-schools-accountability-university-of-delaware-student-arrest-mohammed-sanogos/70555459007/", "title": "Christina schools renews call for UD accountability in student arrest", "text": "Reverberation from the controversial student arrest on the University of Delaware's campus in mid-June once more reached the Christina School District boardroom Tuesday night.\n\nThe system's school board again held a discussion of 18-year-old Mohammed Sanogo's arrest, continuing a reckoning after the Newark High School graduate was violently arrested less than an hour after his graduation on the Newark campus.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/05/04/delaware-school-board-election-guide-know-whos-running-new-castle-de/70153801007/", "title": "Delaware school board election guide: Know who's running in New ...", "text": "Quiet, monotonous meetings once left largely unattended have become battlegrounds for political issues all across the country.

And districts in Delaware’s largest county have been no stranger to unruly debates, packed meetings and sharp tensions.\n\nNow, such a trend continues to trickle down to local elections.\n\nNew Castle County hosts the heaviest competition in school board races this year — as Appoquinimink, Red Clay and Christina public schools post contentious races for open seats.\n\nPushes to strip mask mandates and return to in-person learning dominated rooms in the pandemic. Other student-rights issues, like giving transgender students access to bathrooms or affirming anti-discrimination policies, have also become politically charged in New Castle’s school-board discourse.\n\nDelaware PTA expects to focus on a few major issues this election, the group told Delaware Online, like health and safety in schools, learning loss recovery, school funding and boosting family engagement. However, general opposition to social justice themes — from banning books, challenging critical race theory or other representation — are expected to appear in new packaging, members said, from discussions of a \"Parent Bill of Rights\" to concerns of \"indoctrination.”\n\nHigh learning:New plan promises experience outside the classroom will earn college credit in Delaware\n\nAll of these hot-button issues have, however, brought more eyes to school boards.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" said Sadé Truiett, the PTA’s vice president of advocacy, back in March. \"We want people involved in our school boards, for people to really be speaking about the things that matter to our kids in our schools.\"\n\nSchool board races are considered nonpartisan, though the races have become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nThis year’s election comes on Tuesday, May 9.

Being registered to vote in state and federal elections is not required, nor is having children in schools.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., May 9, with various locations across each district. Voters can also request an absentee ballot.\n\nLearn more about your district below.\n\n[Go to: Appoquinimink, Christina, Red Clay, Smyrna ]\n\nAppoquinimink School District\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story stated ACLU-DE supported a particular candidate. It has since been changed, as the organization remains nonpartisan.\n\nAt-Large seat\n\nTashiba A. Graham, 40, Townsend\n\nBackground: Tashiba Graham is vice president of operations and innovation for a healthcare system in Pennsylvania. The mother of two has a youngest son in the Appoquinimink School District.\n\nIssues: According to Graham, the focus of her campaign is advocating for students with special needs, school safety and teacher retention. She shared her intention to introduce regular assemblies to combat bullying and violence in schools and address general mental wellness among students.\n\nGraham has stated her support for paying teachers and staff members a more competitive salary and improving incentives for new candidates while also evaluating what factors are working to keep staff members in the district. Engaging family members on resources available for students is another priority of hers.\n\nIn response to ACLU-DE voters guide questionnaire regarding national movements restricting certain curriculum material, Graham remains adamant that policies must be put in place to keep the district’s curriculum factual and comprehensive and protect the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students. Graham has been supported by Appoquinimink Educational Support Professionals, First State Action Fund and more.\n\nEducation roundup:Delaware is 1 of 5 states to get $1 million for tutoring in schools\n\nTimothy W. Johns, 57, Middletown\n\nNote: This candidate did not return any requests for contribution from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nBackground: Timothy Johns is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, which he runs with his wife, Monique, in Newark. As co-founder, Johns oversees nonprofit charity work and established a leadership institute, where he has worked as an educator for 12 years. The U.S Army veteran is a father of four adult children.\n\nIssues: Johns says he's mainly concerned with bridging the achievement gap between students of different backgrounds and accessibilities, while setting students up for success in the global marketplace with leadership skills.\n\nJohns has stated during a public Q&A session that he believes conversations related to sexual orientation and gender identity are “family matters\" and should be left out of the classroom. He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/09/04/delaware-media-literacy-schools-education/70711762007/", "title": "Delaware takes leading role in teaching students media literacy", "text": "Larry Nagengast\n\nDelaware Public Media contributor\n\nThis story was produced by the Delaware Journalism Collaborative, a partnership of local news and community organizations working to bridge divides statewide that includes Delaware Public Media. Learn more at ljidelaware.org/collaborative.\n\nFor years, generations even, teachers have been showing their students how to become informed citizens.\n\nThe instruction hasn’t always been explicit and direct, but it has been part of countless lessons. Middle and high school teachers, in assigning a research project, typically remind the class to check their sources, consider the expertise of those sources and be aware that there could be conflicting opinions on their report topic.\n\nIn today’s digital world, the internet has multiplied exponentially the sources of information and, with it, the challenges of verifying what is accurate. Students and adults alike are finding it harder to distinguish between reality and fiction, between fact and opinion.\n\nDelaware appears to be taking a leading role among the states in establishing media literacy standards for students in its public schools.\n\nAccording to a report published in February by Media Literacy Now, a national advocacy organization, Delaware and New Jersey are the only two states that require not only schools to include media literacy instruction in K-12 classrooms but also that their state education agency creates those standards.\n\n“Delaware set a new high bar” with the passage last year of Senate Bill 195, which established those requirements, the Media Literacy Now report stated.\n\nThe standards, however, won’t find their way into classrooms until the start of the 2024-25 school year. The State Board of Education received a preview of the standards at its Aug. 10 meeting and is expected to vote on whether to approve them when it meets on Sept. 21.\n\n“The ability to evaluate information is critical to being an involved citizen. Education is the key to developing people who are ready to be active in civic life,” says Brittney Smith, senior manager of education partnerships for the News Literacy Project, which supports teachers and education agencies in all 50 states.\n\n“The intent of the bill is to teach kids to think for themselves,” says state Rep. Bryan Shupe, R-Milford, who cosponsored the legislation with state Sen. Sarah McBride, D-Wilmington.\n\nDelaware educators and national experts agree that giving students a solid grounding in media literacy can be a step toward reducing polarization in society at large.\n\n“We’re choosing outrage, tribalism, harassment and conspiracy theories over the truth. We have to shore up public resistance,” Jonathan Rauch, author of “The Constitution of Knowledge: A Defense of Truth,” said in an interview.\n\n“There is no downside to making critical thinking part of the curriculum,” he said.\n\n“Our challenge is to adopt standards for students, but students go home and talk to their families about what they did in school. Anytime families are talking about subjects discussed in school, that’s a good thing,” says Alyssa Moore, state Department of Education associate for digital learning and a leader of the statewide task force that is developing the standards.\n\n“What is taught will filter up to parents – absolutely,” says Tyeisha Grier, a parent advocate and community organizer from Smyrna.\n\nWhat does Senate Bill 195 require?\n\nThe legislation, titled “The Digital Citizenship Education Act,” passed both houses of the General Assembly in 2022, and Gov. John Carney signed it into law last Aug. 29. The yes votes came from all the Democrats in both chambers and three House Republicans – Shupe plus Kevin Hensley, R-Odessa/Port Penn, and Jeff Spiegelman, R-Clayton.\n\nIt requires the state Department of Education to adopt evidence-based media literacy standards that are age-appropriate for kindergarten through 12th grade and address appropriate, responsible and healthy online behavior, including, among other things, acceptable use of online platforms, the negative impact of inappropriate technology use, identifying credible sources of information, developing critical thinking skills, identifying the purpose of media messages and issues associated with cybersafety, cyberbullying and hate speech.\n\nWhat do the key terms mean?\n\nS.B. 195 includes these definitions:\n\n“Media literacy” means the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create and take action with all forms of communication, and encompasses the foundational skills of digital citizenship and internet safety, including the norms of appropriate, responsible, ethical and healthy behavior, and cyberbullying prevention.\n\n“Digital citizenship” means the diverse set of skills related to current technology and social media, including the norms of appropriate, responsible and healthy behavior.\n\nLITERACY:How many libraries does Wilmington need? Residents, Delaware officials may disagree\n\nWhat’s in the proposed standards?\n\nA task force that includes Department of Education curriculum, instruction and professional development staff, school district and charter school librarians and instructional technology specialists, state librarian Annie Norman and State Board of Education member Deb Stevens began researching the proposed standards in September 2022.\n\nThe draft standards, taking up 16 pages in a spreadsheet format, combine standards from two organizations of experts, the International Society for Technology in Education and the American Association of School Librarians, with existing state standards in English Language Arts, history and social studies, science and technical subjects.\n\nThey were assembled, Moore said, after reviewing comparable guidelines from one other nation (Finland) and at least 13 states (Arizona, Connecticut, Louisiana, Massachusetts, California, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington). “There were things to learn and glean from all of them. Some focused on media literacy, others on digital citizenship. Our legislation does both,” she said.\n\nThe standards are broken down by grade level – elementary, middle school and high school – but in many cases, the same wording applies to each grouping. Much of the wording in the standards is heavy with educational jargon.\n\nFor example, to meet the legislation’s requirement concerning understanding the purpose and acceptable use of different social media platforms, one of the AASL standards applicable to the entire K-12 spectrum reads: “Learners exchange information resources within and beyond their learning community by: Contributing to collaboratively constructed information sites by ethically using and reproducing others’ work.”\n\nWhile the language of the standards may prove challenging to those outside the education community, the topics they cover are comprehensive. The skills students should acquire include:\n\nEngaging in positive, safe, legal and ethical behavior when using technology.\n\nUsing a variety of communication tools and resources.\n\nManaging personal data to maintain digital privacy ad security.\n\nEvaluating the accuracy, perspective, credibility and relevance of information.\n\nMaking critical choices about information sources to use.\n\nQuestioning and assessing the validity and accuracy of information.\n\nEstablishing connections with other learners.\n\nUsing collaborative technologies to work with others to investigate solutions.\n\nUsing technology, including the internet, to produce and publish writing and to collaborate with others.\n\nRecognizing target marketing strategies and persuasion techniques.\n\nInteracting with learners who reflect a range of perspectives.\n\nCollecting information representing diverse perspectives.\n\nEvaluating a speaker’s point of view, reasoning and use of evidence.\n\nExhibiting empathy with a tolerance for diverse ideas.\n\nWhile most of the standards are the same for the three grade groupings, the instruction will necessarily be delivered differently, depending on the student’s age. All these topics won’t be presented to first graders, for example, but younger students should be exposed to each of the standards by fifth grade. The difference would be in the resources, the discussions, the lesson themes, Moore says, using situations “that are ‘real world’ to the grade levels at a particular time.”\n\n“With the little ones, it’s teaching not to accept messages from strangers. For the older ones, it’s how to know if information is true, how to get away from fake news,” says Bonnie Gaus, longtime librarian at McVey Elementary in the Christina School District.\n\nHow will the standards be implemented?\n\nAt the school level, both in districts and charter schools, the expectation is that the instruction will most often be folded into the current curriculum, so there won’t be entirely new classes devoted to digital citizenship and media literacy.\n\nIn many districts, elementary school librarians, who have been trained to teach children basic research skills, have incorporated lessons on computer use and internet topics into their classes in recent years. With the new standards, librarians and others responsible for teaching digital basics will have to increase their emphasis on the items mandated in the standards.\n\nSimilarly, in middle schools and high schools, teachers who assign research papers – primarily those in English and social studies – will most likely have the greatest responsibility for ensuring their students understand the new standards.\n\n“There’s a lot of overlap with language arts and social studies,” says Christina Scheffel, an instructional technology specialist with the Indian River School District. “We’re going to our content specialists and asking them to consider how to include social media on top of what you’re already doing.”\n\nIn the Colonial School District, “the lessons for kindergarten through fifth grades are straightforward, taught by librarians and media specialists,” says Jeff Menzer, the district superintendent. “At the secondary level, it’s more in the English language arts and social studies curriculum.”\n\nSTANDARDIZED TESTING:What works? Delaware’s Lake Forest educators discuss growth in their test scores\n\nNorth vs. South; left vs. right. Any problems here?\n\nIn a polarized society, and in a state like Delaware where downstate residents tend to be conservative and those in the north tend to be moderate to liberal, it would be understandable to have some concern about whether the standards could be taught consistently in all areas of the state.\n\nMcBride, considered one of the more progressive members of the state Senate, is not anticipating problems but acknowledges that issues could arise.\n\n“A lot of the curriculum will be woven through subjects currently taught. It would be apolitical and nonideological. It shouldn’t raise the specter of opposition,” McBride says. But, she adds, “we live in politically charged times. We’re unable to predict what someone will latch onto and make a mountain out of a molehill.”\n\n“There may be some differences in curriculum from north to south, but the intent of the bill is to teach kids to think for themselves,” says Shupe, the Milford Republican. “If the districts take that to heart, it should be essentially the same across the state.”\n\n“This isn’t about pushing one political agenda or another. It’s about getting people to think critically about what they see,” says Scheffel, the Indian River technology professional.\n\n“Your curriculum teams have to be mindful of and sensitive to their audiences,” says Menzer, the Colonial superintendent.\n\nSmith, the News Literacy Project partnerships manager, says that getting students to learn how to think critically should start with educators choosing discussion topics that are less likely to trigger polarization.\n\nFor example, having middle schoolers discuss or research whether it’s essential to earn a four-year college degree can help them recognize differing viewpoints without triggering as much potential polarization as, say, debating immigration policy or the 2020 election outcome.\n\nBoth Smith and Rauch, the author, say it’s important to get students to reflect on their personal biases and to seek information outside their comfort zones.\n\n“We’re all inclined to read and view only the stuff that supports our biases,” Rauch says. “We have to push ourselves to look at sources out of the way from where we usually look.”\n\nWhat parents are saying\n\n“Many parents lack digital literacy, and that affects their children,” says parent advocate Tyeisha Grier, whose son is entering his junior year at Caesar Rodney High School. By implementing statewide standards, she says, “we have an opportunity to do for youths what some parents cannot do.”\n\nThe ability of students to finesse controls on social media sites is also troubling to some parents. “All these platforms have workarounds and the kids can figure them out,” says Donyale Hall of Dover, a mother of 10, ranging from a 5-year-old through high school graduates.\n\nChildren have long had to battle peer pressure, “and the struggle is a little different now because parents are not tech savvy,” she says.\n\nMAKING A DIFFERENCE:Neighborhood nuisance property in New Castle now home for former foster children\n\nJust as schools had to educate many parents on the basics of online instruction three years ago at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, they are now facing the challenge of adding digital literacy and security themes to their messaging. Last year Indian River tried organizing events for parents geared specifically to those topics but drew “zero interest,” Scheffel said. The district has done better, she said, by setting up tables and distributing flyers at other activities that are more likely to attract parents, like one on multilingual diversity.\n\nHall says that schools much reach beyond their walls, and beyond their basic constituencies. “You need to work with community leaders, with faith leaders,” she says.\n\n“With digital, there are so many subtle things that anyone could easily misunderstand,” says Yunfei Lou, a father of two elementary students who recently was elected to the board of education in the Christina School District. “Many parents are very concerned.”\n\nThe addition of digital tools to individuals’ communications toolsets multiplies the possibilities of misunderstandings and arguments, Hall says. “I tell my kids that it takes two people to have an argument. Don’t respond to the person [who tries to pick a fight online].”\n\nLou is confident that increasing digital literacy within today’s student population can have an impact on decreasing polarization within society overall.\n\n“It’s not just teaching facts. It’s having the ability to critically think that will mitigate radicalization and polarization,” he says. “We have to teach children about conflict resolution and setting boundaries.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/15/gov-john-carney-pitches-60-m-weighted-funding-delaware-schools/2575044002/", "title": "Gov. John Carney pitches $60M in weighted funding for Delaware ...", "text": "Delaware public schools would get more money to educate English language learners and low-income students under an initiative proposed by Gov. John Carney.\n\n“This is an issue we can’t afford to ignore any longer,” he said. “We can’t afford to leave one child behind.”\n\nHis plan to revamp the state’s Opportunity Grants program would direct $60 million over the next three years to districts and charter schools based on the number of students they enroll in each of those categories.\n\nPending approval from the Delaware General Assembly, the program would direct $500 to each district and charter school for every English language learner and $300 for each low-income student. Low-income would be determined by whether the student receives federal poverty benefits, starting with the 2019/2020 school year.\n\nThose grants would come in addition to the annual per pupil allocation provided to the state’s 19 districts and 21 state-authorized charter schools. Delaware is one of the few states that does not account for poverty or English proficiency in its school funding formula.\n\nThe proposal would provide significant new funding to the Capital School District in Dover, where more than half of the 6,500 students are considered low-income; and the Indian River School District, where one in five students are English language learners.\n\nOther districts like Seaford and Christina have high proportions of students from both categories.\n\n“Gov. Carney is the first governor to address additional funding for disadvantaged students,” said Stephanie Ingram, president of the powerful state educators’ union. “We are thankful that he has brought this issue to the forefront and is working to find a funding solution.”\n\nChanging the state’s decades-old, per-pupil funding system was a central goal of the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a panel formed under former Gov. Jack Markell to recommend improvements for the same at-risk children Carney’s plan is intended to help.\n\n“This is a watershed moment,” said WEIC chair Tony Allen, now provost at Delaware State University. “We’re delighted this opportunity has come to fruition in a big way.”\n\nState officials say the additional funding is intended to help schools provide a better education to students who tend to score significantly lower on standardized testing than their peers.\n\nThe program will focus specifically on improving third-grade reading and school attendance, among other markers.\n\nExactly how schools use that extra money would be determined by each district and charter school and approved by the state Department of Education.\n\nCarney said the idea is to give local schools flexibility to develop innovative solutions that best fit their individual needs. After three years, he said, the state could require that districts adopt the plans that produced the best results.\n\nThe governor’s plan would mark the third evolution of the Opportunity Grant program in as many years. The initiative first provided $1 million for programs that benefit low-income and English language learners through a competitive grant program before being shifted to an automatic statewide allocation that cost $6 million this year.\n\nUnder the governor’s latest proposal, the Legislature would need to approve funding for the grant program each of the next three years, a wrinkle some fear could put it on the chopping block if an economic downturn strikes.\n\n“I think the governor’s proposal has great merit,” said House Minority Leader Danny Short, R-Seaford. “The question is how much money will be available and how long will it continue.”\n\nThe proposal also comes as Carney and other state officials seek to defend themselves from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Delaware alleging Delaware is failing to provide adequate educational opportunities for disadvantaged students, including children from low-income families and children whose first language is not English.\n\nA judge in November refused to dismiss that lawsuit, opening the possibility that the courts could ultimately force Delaware’s three counties to reassess properties for the first time in decades, a factor the ACLU claims is partially to blame for the lack of adequate funding.\n\nKathleen MacRae of the ACLU called Carney’s proposal a positive step but one that falls well short of addressing the underlying problem.\n\n“The fact is it’s only 1 percent of the state’s overall education budget and only extends for three years,” she said. “Our hope is that the state finds a more permanent and substantial solution to this issue.”\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nEDUCATION STORIES THAT HIT HOME\n\nOdyssey Charter School union lambasts school board with a vote of no confidence\n\nHead of school at Tatnall departs in middle of the academic year\n\nStop bringing fast food for students, Milford High School tells parents", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/07/01/free-lunch-delaware-lawmakers-public-schools-education-roundup/74221084007/", "title": "Free lunch, mental health supports, more bills aim at Delaware ...", "text": "School's out.\n\nOr, no. Legislative session is out, and lawmakers have wrapped up their work in Dover.\n\nFrom repealing the death penalty and two bills targeting “deepfakes,\" to a $1.1 billion bond bill and the assembly overriding a veto to support retirees' benefits coverage — it had been a busy time in Legislative Hall leading into the weekend. Not too busy, though, to miss the General Assembly also sending education-related bills to the governor's desk.\n\nIn this weekly roundup, we'll catch you up on some updates you may have missed.\n\n[Did we miss another good education story? Tell me about it: kepowers@gannett.com.]\n\nEducation highlights from Legislature's final week\n\nPromises of education reform hit the floor in Dover before the session's end.\n\nAs the bills make their way to Gov. John Carney for his signature, some highlights come in student wellness. One bill looks to establish a mental health services unit across Delaware high schools.\n\nOver three years, House Bill 200 aims to reach a final ratio of 250 students per full-time school counselor, school social worker or licensed clinical social worker in schools. The ratio for a full-time school psychologist would be 700 to 1. Total cost by fiscal year 2026 is estimated to reach $33.8 million, in combined local and state funds.\n\nAnother measure focused on free school meals.\n\nHouse Bill 125, as substituted, would require \"all public schools to offer only students who qualify for a reduced-price meal, under the federal School Breakfast Program and National School Lunch Program, a free breakfast and lunch every school day.\"\n\nAnd it could take effect the next school year if signed into law. Funding for the measure has already made the state’s budget, under the $242,000 designated for “child nutrition.”\n\nThis assembly also \"strengthened the workforce pipeline for public education,\" according to a Senate press release Sunday, creating the Delaware Educator Apprenticeship Program, codifying the teacher academy pathways program and helping schools recruit.\n\nAlso in education, Senate Bill 297 heads to Carney's desk.\n\nIt would require the Department of Education to \"update content standards and regulations using a non-exhaustive list of racial, ethnic and cultural groups” for K-12 education. This would include AAPI studies, as pushed by Make Us Visible Delaware since the fall, but theoretically not stop there.\n\nThe bill does not get into specifics or accountability guardrails. It does, however, start by adding to state standards in code, if signed into law.\n\n“I’m hopeful for a Delaware where students of any racial, cultural or ethnic group can see themselves reflected in their textbooks,\" said Devin Jiang, co-director of Make Us Visible Delaware. \"Delaware has an opportunity to stand against anti-Asian American bullying and embrace visibility for all.\"\n\nLawmakers also signaled support for the removal of Christina School District from Wilmington, nodding to the Redding Consortium's recommendation earlier this spring. That connects to broader goals for redistricting schools across Delaware's largest city.\n\nLook out for more coverage to come on this now-wrapped legislative session.\n\nWilmington with fewer school districts?Delaware lawmakers signal support for removing Christina School District from Wilmington\n\nBiden administration invests $16.7 million for marine technology — UD sees $1.75 million\n\nLast week, the U.S. Department of Commerce and NOAA announced $16.7 million in funding in a dozen awards to \"support the development of innovative, new technologies and public-private partnerships\" focused on sustainability, biodiversity and supporting climate adaptation.\n\nThese awards, fueled by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, look to boost marine technology innovation.\n\nAnd the University of Delaware will get a cut.\n\nUD, alongside its partners in Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, are recommended to receive $1.75 million, according to a press release, to \"establish and develop\" a Marine Biodiversity Observation Network for this region's coast.\n\n“To tackle climate change nationwide, we have to better understand and manage our coasts,” said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo in the announcement. “These awards will advance new technologies needed to gain critical insights into the status and health of our coastal ecosystems.”\n\nUD:Delaware native George Thorogood receives the University of Delaware’s Medal of Distinction\n\n5 Delaware teens selected as Bank of America 2024 Student Leaders\n\nBank of America announced five \"2024 Student Leaders\" to highlight this year.\n\nFrom varsity sports to environmentalists, the class \"showcases a bright future for the First State,\" according to the financial outfit.

This is a long-term commitment,\" Gov. John Carney said. \"The purpose of this public meeting is to hear from you.\"\n\nDrawn to Bayard for the discussion was a crowd typical for Christina district meetings, including Mary Shorse, whose son attends Newark High School.\n\n\"I'm always cautiously optimistic,\" Shorse said. \"All those things they're proposing, great, all those things sound wonderful. Let's put them in every school. But the state hasn't demonstrated to me that they are as committed to funding a lot of these things.\"\n\nMore:Plan to help Wilmington students begins to take shape\n\nCarney asked the district early this month to consider entering a partnership with his office, the state department of education and the Christina Education Association to focus on improving Wilmington schools’ success.\n\nCarney's office says the partnership will address the long-term success of the 1,640 Christina students in preschool through grade 8 who live in the city.\n\nThose students attend Bancroft Elementary School, Elbert-Palmer Elementary School, Pulaski Elementary School, Stubbs Elementary School and Bayard Middle School.\n\nFirst, stakeholders in the state and the school district will iron out the details of what's to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year with an official agreement.\n\n\"That's the purpose of our seeking a memorandum of understanding, so that there's agreement between the board and us on how we're going to work together,\" Carney said.\n\nCarney wants the partnership to focus on giving principals and teachers more control of resources, focusing on student achievement rates; addressing trauma faced by Wilmington students, and building meaningful and sustained change.\n\nBut a pair of early questions about funding, including one from Schorse, demonstrated that the pieces are still being collected, and how they'll be arranged is yet to be determined.\n\nTo address cost, Carney pointed to consolidation and maximization of current resources, then requests for additional dollars can follow.\n\n\"It really starts with that educational leader, the principal, and empowering the teachers to be successful,\" Carney said. \"It's going to take money, and we're going to try to find ways to more efficiently use the facilities we have, to start with the most obvious.\"\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle asked for some details about empowering principals and teachers to make more decisions nearest the classroom, but Superintendent Richard Gregg said he wanted to keep from being premature.\n\n\"We are engaging in a conversation with our principals now,\" Gregg said. \"We have not really gotten to the detailed, nitty-gritty granular side of it yet. We're just now beginning to work.\"\n\nLeslie Footman, a teacher at Elbert-Palmer Elementary School, said she hadn't expected a great amount of detail because she knows there are groups, like the teachers' union, which still have to be fully consulted.\n\n\"There were a lot of good questions and they gave us information, but I'm really interested in seeing what it all looks like. We can talk about it but until we see it on paper, we don't actually know what they're expecting Christina School District to do,\" Footman said.\n\nMore:Carney leads delegation to Massachusetts 'model' school\n\nBoth sides of a dais paid special attention to the challenges Wilmington students faced, especially the effects on learning surrounding the trauma of poverty and violence.\n\n\"Resilience is important.

John Carney has vetoed a bill that would have eliminated charter schools' ability to give enrollment preference to students who live within 5 miles of their campuses primarily because he felt it was unfair to Wilmington students in the Christina School District.\n\nThe bill would have allowed charter schools to prioritize students who live in parts of a school district \"geographically contiguous\" to them.\n\nThis means Newark Charter School, which boasts a waiting list of 3,000, could still give preference to enrollees who live in the Newark part of the Christina School District. Applicants living in a smaller section of Wilmington, also in the district, would not have the same advantage.\n\nSTORY:Lack of responses raises questions about Delaware teacher survey\n\nSTORY:Award-winning author speaks at Brandywine school\n\nCarney found this troubling, especially considering the fact Christina is the only school district in the state that is split up over two separate geographical areas.\n\n\"I believe that the sponsors of HS 1 for HB 85 wanted to expand options for students and increase diversity at Delaware charter schools by eliminating the five-mile radius as an enrollment preference,\" Carney said in a statement. \"These are goals that I share.\n\n\"Despite those efforts, this legislation unfairly excludes some of our most vulnerable students. It does not simply remove the five-mile radius preference. The legislation creates a new standard that uniquely limits options for at-risk students in the Christina School District portion of the city of Wilmington – many of the kids who need our help the most – and that is something I cannot support.”\n\nSen. David Sokola, D-Newark, who sponsored the bill in the Senate, said the goal of charter schools is to foster \"feeder-pattern type attendance,\" creating the feel of a neighborhood school.\n\nHe argued removing the geographic preference would pave the way for a \"default no-zone,\" defeating that purpose.\n\nSubsequently, he was against an amendment proposed by Senate Majority Leader Margaret Rose Henry, D-Wilmington East, which would have allowed all students living in the district, including the non-contiguous areas, enrollment preference.\n\nIt is \"really wrong\" that students who live in Wilmington would not have the same opportunity as Newark residents to attend the Newark Charter School, Henry told The News Journal last month.\n\n\"Children in Wilmington will continue to be discriminated against,\" Henry said. \"I'm very disappointed in the members of the Senate because I had thought over all the work we'd done ... there was an understanding of the need to have inclusion for all children to have access to a quality education.\"\n\nDespite that argument, Henry's amendment, which was sponsored by three Wilmington-area senators, was defeated 8-6. The bill was passed by the Senate and sent to Carney's desk, where after reviewing the specifics, he refused to sign it.\n\nLawmakers will have a chance to override Carney's veto when the General Assembly resumes in January, according to state law. It will require a three-fifths majority in both chambers.\n\nBut Kim Williams, who wrote the bill and sponsored it in the House, said getting the bill to the governor's desk in the first place took hours upon hours of work, not to mention compromise.\n\nShe had originally intended the bill to only eliminate the 5-mile radius preference, she said. To get the legislation through the Senate, however, she reached a deal with Sokola, who wanted the clause about geographically contiguous areas added.\n\nWilliams was faced with a choice: Make it possible for all Christina School District students to apply to Newark Charter School? Or make it possible for at least the students in Newark?\n\n\"I didn't want to compromise, but that's part of being an elected official,\" she said. \"I have worked for education. I'm a voice for all kids. And this has been a really challenging bill for me.\"\n\nWilliams said she'd like to work with Newark Charter School to address the issue, and that she plans on introducing a new bill, that focuses solely on the 5-mile radius, next year.\n\nThe Delaware Charter Schools Network said in a statement that they would work with the General Assembly and the governor on legislation that was \"on behalf of all Delaware students.\"\n\n“We agree with the governor’s focus on closing the achievement gap,\" the statement said. \"In his veto, he made it clear that addressing the core issues behind that gap will require a hard look at systemic, district-wide issues that go beyond the question of geographic preferences.\"\n\nOf course, those with strong ties to Wilmington vocally opposed the bill and would like to see more systemic change around education in the city.\n\nThe Wilmington City Council issued the following statement: \"Council believes that this legislation was discriminatory on its surface and would not have stood a constitutional test. It is our fervent hope that Governor Carney will exercise his leadership to further discussions about the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission’s plan that would reduce the number of school districts in the city of Wilmington and provide a weighted funding formula for the high-poverty segregated schools that the state has created.\"\n\nStephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington East, as well as Reps. Charles Potter and John Kowalko, also felt the bill was discriminatory, and even wrote a letter to the Attorney General's Office in May asking him to look into the legality of such legislation.\n\nOn Thursday, Bolden said Wilmington students are already getting the short shrift and that students shouldn't be limited from going to the school of their choice. She also believes the state should move ahead with recommendations from the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission.\n\nWhile Wilmington students deserve more options, they also deserve better education in general, she said.\n\n\"We really need to have a handle back on our children,\" she said. \"Our children are failing. They're dropping out of school.\"\n\nLooking for more education news?

About a quarter of the school's students are in special education.\n\nStudents at Bayard are almost entirely African-American and Hispanic/Latino.\n\nState testing data shows 64 percent of low-income students, 85 percent of English language learners and 86 percent of students with disabilities did not meet the state standards in grades three through eight for English language arts, the lawsuit said.\n\nSeventy-four percent of low-income students, 81 percent of English learners and 89 percent of students with disabilities were below the state’s math standards in those grades, the lawsuit added.\n\nAbout half of Delaware's third-graders struggle to read.\n\nStory continues below PDF.\n\nThe suit claims the state has long recognized that disadvantaged students are performing poorly in comparison to their peers, and the problem has been detailed in state-commissioned task force reports issued in 2001, 2008 and 2015.\n\nThose reports lay out educational standards and interventions necessary to support achievement, including smaller class sizes; expanded school time; highly qualified, specially trained teachers; a focus on early literacy; current technology; effective family engagement; and partnerships with health, family welfare and specialized education service providers.\n\nYet, the lawsuit says many schools in Delaware are not provided with enough resources to follow these recommendations and recent spending cuts have made them even further out of reach.\n\n“Despite the best efforts of teachers, families and school staff, the current education system fails too many Delaware children,\" said ACLU-DE legal director Ryan Tack-Hooper in a statement. \"The state often provides more support to children who are well off than it provides to children living in poverty. The state must meet its constitutional obligation to adequately educate all students.\"\n\nThere are also fewer resources available to schools because property values have not been reassessed for more than 30 years, the lawsuit said. The result is that the underlying school tax base has remained flat for decades while the cost of running schools has risen substantially due to inflation and increased enrollment, the lawsuit said.\n\nOne proposed solution has been to institute a needs-based funding formula, which gives a bigger piece of the pie to disadvantaged students by weighting them more highly. It's something that has been argued for by the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee established by former Gov. Jack Markell in 2015 to come up with ideas to improve education in the city.\n\nBut Gov. John Carney, listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, has said he is not in favor of needs-based funding, in part because it gives extra money to school districts serving at-risk kids without holding them accountable for how they use it. He has also said there is neither the financial nor political support for such a measure.\n\nCarney is working with the Christina School District to improve educational outcomes in Wilmington, where Bayard is located, and has proposed giving the Christina School District $1.5 million (to increase by 2 percent every year) for new initiatives there, plus additional money for a dual-generation center.\n\nElizabeth Lockman, a Wilmington parent, vice chair of WEIC, and a member of Delawareans for Educational Opportunity, said the lawsuit was not an indictment of Carney's plan and that those dollars could be beneficial.\n\n\"But how much more meaningful and exciting would it be to fix the funding system and the way those resources flow?\" she said, adding that it's almost unfair to use Bayard Middle School as an example because there are low-performing, low-income schools throughout the state and changing the funding formula could help all of them.\n\n\"This is not a brand new idea,\" she said. \"The inequities have been very clear.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said 46 other states provide additional financial support for English language learners. There are 35 states that provide additional financial support for low-income children.\n\n\"From 1990 to 2011, 26 states substantially increased funding for low-income students and high poverty schools to ensure meaningful educational opportunity for all — the majority as a result of court orders,\" MacCrae said, quoting the lawsuit. \"As a result, we now have two decades of robust empirical evidence about whether and how school funding affects student achievement. It demonstrates that adequate funding leads to increased achievement, even among students who face significant barriers to achievement because of their socioeconomic circumstances.\"\n\nPaul Herdman, president and CEO of the Rodel Foundation, said his organization has been studying the needs-based funding issue and has found that lawsuits often serve as an important catalyst for fundamental shifts in education funding.\n\n\"We've written for over a decade that this current funding system has to change,\" he said. \"And candidly, I don't know of any state that has come to a different funding system on their own, without legal action.\n\n\"My hope is that we can use this as an opportunity to step back and say we've had this funding system for 70-plus years, let's not just band-aid what we've got,\" he said. \"There are very few things that were built 80 years ago that don't need to be redesigned a bit. It's not that it's a flawed system inherently. It's just, in my view, served its purpose and needs to be rethought.\"\n\nTack-Hooper, with the ACLU, said the lawsuit does not ask the court to impose a specific funding formula or needs-based funding but does ask that it finds the current funding system unconstitutional and in need of change.\n\nWhile the state does not determine the amount of money spent at each school on a per-student basis, the lawsuit says \"an analysis of teacher salary data at every school shows that, in at least seven school districts, the per-student expenditure at a school decreases as the percentage of low-income students in the student body of a school increases.\"\n\nThe seven districts are Appoquinimink, Capital, Caesar Rodney, Christina, Indian River, Milford and Red Clay.\n\nThere are also disparities from district to district. For example, in 2013-2014, Delaware allocated $1,694 per pupil less to Woodbridge School District than to Brandywine School District, even though Brandywine’s per-student wealth (property value divided by the number of school children) is more than one and one-half times that of Woodbridge.\n\nSimilarly, the state spent $450 per pupil less in Caesar Rodney School District than it did in Appoquinimink School District, although Appoquinimink’s per-student wealth exceeds Caesar Rodney’s by approximately $100,000.\n\nThe lawsuit also mentions racial discrimination and outlines the history of desegregation in Delaware. It contends that the Neighborhood Schools Act passed in 2000 and the Charter School Act has led to re-segregation in some places.\n\nFor example, in the 2016-2017 school year, Red Clay's Warner and Shortlidge Elementary schools were 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent white, respectively, while the district in which they are located is 43.6 percent white.\n\nBy contrast, Heritage Elementary School, in the same district but outside the city of Wilmington, was 70 percent white. The highest-performing charter school in the area, the Charter School of Wilmington, was 6.3 percent black.\n\nThe percentage of black students enrolled in predominantly non-white schools in 2010 was ten times higher than 1989.\n\nLinwood Jackson, president of the Delaware NAACP, said the fight for educational opportunity is not new to his organization. He said Louis Redding, Delaware's first black lawyer, did not join the legal team in Brown v. Board of Education to create a system where African-American and low-income kids were relegated to rundown school buildings with inadequate resources, however.\n\n\"It would have been unthinkable to him,\" Jackson said.\n\nDelaware NAACP is dedicated to ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to obtain a high-quality public school education. Delawareans for Educational Opportunity is an association of concerned parents and community leaders that includes parents of low-income students, students with disabilities and English language learners.\n\nThe complaint and other information is available at www.ACLU-DE.org and www.DECLASI.org.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

At 10 a.m. in every time zone, organizers are encouraging teachers, students, administrators, parents and allies to walk out for 17 minutes – one minute for every person killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High on Valentine’s Day.\n\nStudents in Delaware are working together, connecting via email and social media to coordinate. They plan on wearing orange and using the Twitter hashtags #dewalkouts and #enough. Some students are considering reciting the names of the victims or singing songs like Amazing Grace, while others may give short speeches and carry signs.\n\n\"Our main goal is to have common sense gun legislation introduced as soon as possible,\" said Sofia Rose, a senior at John Dickinson High School. \"While common sense gun control means something different to everyone, it is important to foster discussions about what gun laws are going to do the most to prevent future tragedies.\n\n\"Students who survived the Parkland shooting are hoping that this most recent mass shooting will go down in history as not just another school shooting, but as the last one. This is a lofty goal, but the only way we can push Congress to listen to the brave Parkland students is by raising our voices with them.\"\n\nTo that end, students at more than 20 Delaware schools are planning walkouts. Some districts, like Red Clay, have said they will not actively promote or encourage the walkouts, but will not take disciplinary action against students who take part.\n\nWilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki and state Sen. Bryan Townsend, D-South Newark, will attend and speak at a walkout at Cab Calloway School of the Arts and The Charter School of Wilmington, which share a building. Students there will have posters dedicated to each victim. On one side, will be the victims' names, ages and pictures. On the other side of the posters will be a short advocacy message.\n\n\"A team of Cab and CSW students are bringing this movement to their school communities,\" reads a Charter School of Wilmington . \"Not only is this a milestone for our collective community, but it’s also a milestone for many individuals as this is their first venture into advocacy and taking direct action to stand up for what they believe in.\"\n\nStudents at the Wilmington Friends School staged a walkout Feb. 21.\n\nIn a statement, Christina School District Superintendent Richard Gregg said students will not be disciplined for participating in peaceful protests.\n\n\"I feel it is important to communicate that the Christina School District administration supports the rights of students to express themselves safely and peacefully, and there will be no disciplinary actions toward students who participate in organized protest activities,\" Gregg said.\n\n\"Administrators in the district have chosen to view this as an opportunity for students to raise awareness about school safety and to participate in the democratic process.\"\n\nOther school districts have condemned the walkouts as unsafe and have asked students not to leave the building.\n\nKevin Fitzgerald, superintendent of Caesar Rodney School District, said students should look for other ways to voice their discontentment with gun laws. He said students may be punished for walking out.\n\n\"Unfortunately, schools have become soft targets,\" he said. \"And when I hear everybody do this, on this particular day, I worry. How do I keep my students safe?\"\n\n\"I can't say this is a good idea. I can't guarantee they'll be safe when they leave my buildings.\"\n\nWhen students disagreed with his stance on Facebook, their comments were deleted, they said.\n\nStudent-led walkouts will be allowed at Cape Henlopen High School and Sussex Academy, while Indian River School District announced it was prioritizing safety in a letter home to parents last week.\n\n\"A school walkout would not only be a major safety concern but a disruptive event to the educational process for all students,\" superintendent Mark Steele said in the letter. \"Therefore, we do not support this protest and our expectation is that students will remain in the building, as we are unable to provide the same level of safety outside in an open area.\"\n\nSteele said he consulted with police agencies, school safety personnel and building principals before the decision was made. Per IRSD policy, students can hold \"peaceful assembly\" as long as it doesn't disrupt classes or other scheduled activities within the school.\n\nOn March 14, students and staff will instead be able to \"develop activities within the safety of our buildings that will provide students a way to voice their concerns no matter where they fall in this debate,\" Steele said in the letter.\n\nRyan Tack-Hooper, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware, said students should contact the ACLU if they think they're being unfairly punished for exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\n\"You don't get a free pass just because the thing you're doing is righteous,\" he said. \"Students can be disciplined for missing or substantially disrupting classes. But extra punishment for a protest would raise serious First Amendment concerns. We would want to hear from any student who faced more discipline for a protest than they faced for other missed classes. Of course, just because a school can discipline students doesn’t mean they should. We encourage schools to exercise restraint.”\n\nStudents at Caesar Rodney, who started a new Twitter account, CR Riders for Change, to share their opinions on the matter, said they'll take whatever punishment is doled out and plan on walking out despite Fitzgerald's disapproval. There will be a town hall-style Q&A session with local legislators directly following the walkout, they announced on Twitter.\n\nThe Milford School District does not condone students leaving the building. Milford High School will have an inside safe zone designated for students who choose to walk out for the 17 minutes, and elementary and middle school students will not be permitted to walk out without a parent, or legal guardian, physically signing the student out from school for an early dismissal.\n\nHigh school students that elect to walk out will be marked unexcused and will be responsible for making up any missed classwork.\n\n\"While we support the student voice and freedom of expression, Milford School District does not endorse participation in protest or walkout events nor do we sponsor them,\" Superintendent Kevin A. Dickerson said in a letter to parents.\n\nPatricia Oliphant, director of Sussex Academy in Georgetown, said she believes in letting students exercise their first amendment rights.\n\nI'm allowing it because I believe (students) have rights to freedom of speech,\" said Patricia Oliphant, director of Sussex Academy. \"It's their way of honoring (the victims) and at the same time believing the gun violence is tragic and needs to stop.\"\n\nA Sussex Academy student had expressed her concerns about the shooting to a social studies teacher, saying she wanted to do something regarding the walkout, according to Oliphant. The teacher told her to come up with a plan, and she did.\n\nStudents who don't want to participate in the walkout, which will be held inside the school, can remain in class uninterrupted.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about being outside the building, and that was the student's design,\" Oliphant said.\n\nWalkouts planned\n\nNationally, school walkouts are being organized by the Women's March Youth EMPOWER group. Rose participated in a conference call this week with 200 youth from around the nation planning their own, local protests.\n\nStudents at the following schools and colleges are planning walkouts for March 14.

The department tests for these bacteria throughout the summer at the Delaware beaches, and when advisories are in effect, swimming is not recommended.\n\n\"These bacteria most likely originate from wildlife sources and increased rainfall, waves or wildlife feeding near the surf (shorebirds, marine mammals or other warm-blooded animals) and can result in these indicator bacteria washing into the near shore waters,\" the advisory said.\n\nThere were 107 enterococci colonies per 100 milliliters of water at Bethany Beach on Wednesday, according to the department's website. (Results for bacteria testing become available 24 hours after they are delivered to a laboratory, the website says.) That's compared with the geometric mean of eight enterococci colonies per 100 milliliters of water at Bethany Beach this year to date and the state saltwater standard of 35 colonies.\n\nThis marks the second water quality advisory at the Delaware beaches this year, with the first being on July 25 at Herring Point in Cape Henlopen State Park.

High bacteria levels are common after rainfall in areas where wildlife — migratory shorebirds and mating horseshoes in particular for Delaware — flock to.\n\nOne of those areas and the first Delaware beach to have such an advisory issued was Slaughter Beach, back in May, after water quality tests found high levels of bacteria in the water.

It is likely, she said, that the advisory will be lifted.\n\nRehoboth was the only sampling location between Slaughter Beach and Fenwick Island that had elevated bacteria, she said.\n\n\"It's the rain,\" she said. \"It definitely was the rain.\"\n\nThe city is studying ways to reduce runoff pollution as part of an agreement with state environmental officials that was linked to a proposed ocean outfall, which would dispose of treated sewer waste about a mile off the shore. Several city streets drain into the ocean through pipes that are connected to jetties and extend out into the ocean just beyond the beach.\n\nRehoboth rarely exceeds the state swimming water standards and in recent years has been recognized with a Blue Water award because of high swimming water quality.\n\nRouse said a healthy swimming won't likely be at increased risk but children, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems should avoid swimming until the bacteria numbers fall within the safe limit.\n\nThe most common ailments are gastrointestinal disorders and ear and nose infections, Rouse said.\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

And there he was, on the first day of Eagles' training camp, getting a so-called sack on Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts.\n\nCarter, who was working with the second team at the time (he started the day with the third team), got past right guard Cam Jurgens on an inside move and got to Hurts, stopping in front of Hurts just before another defensive lineman got there on the other side.\n\nQuarterbacks are not allowed to be hit, but the play was blown dead, signifying a sack.\n\nIt was one of the most noticeable plays during the Eagles' first practice, which lasted a little more than an hour.\n\nBut could this be a sign of things to come?\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nThe Eagles clearly have high hopes for Carter at defensive tackle. He was expected to be one of the first players picked in the draft, but a deadly car accident involving another car (Carter pleaded no contest to racing and reckless driving) and a poor Pro Day back in January led to Carter sliding down in the draft.\n\nCarter's talent was never the issue. That was something Eagles center Jason Kelce, who was not matched up against Carter, noticed right away.\n\nWHERE'S THE CEILING?Why Jalen Hurts hasn’t come close to reaching his ceiling as Eagles open training camp\n\nCAMP COUNTDOWN:Eagles' 9 most important (besides Jalen Hurts): At No. 1, this star set an incredible record\n\n\"You kind of feel a drastic inside move,\" Kelce said about Carter on the sack. \"We're talking about him. I think I'd be interested in looking at the tape and see what it looks like, and continue to watch him. This is the first day. I've learned to not take first impressions as the end-all, be-all.\n\n\"The mark of this league is consistency ... the guys who do it day in, day out, game in, game out, season after season are the guys who are going to have sustained success. So I look forward to see all these guys (develop).\"\n\nSo, sure, it was a good first day for Carter, but there's still a long way to go.\n\nHere are some other observations from the Eagles' first day of training camp:\n\nHowie Roseman on avoiding Super Bowl letdown\n\nEagles general manager Howie Roseman spoke to the media before the start of practice Wednesday. He was asked why it's so hard for teams who lose the Super Bowl to win it all the following season. That has happened only three times in the 57 previous Super Bowls.\n\n\"I think every situation is different,\" Roseman said. \"For our situation and the messaging, it starts with (head coach Nick Sirianni) is that this is a different year, and we got to everything we possibly can to maximize this team, this moment. Whatever we've done in the past doesn't matter. It's whatever we do going forward.\n\n\"From a roster-building standpoint, from a personnel-building standpoint, we can't rely on what's happened to other teams who have lost the Super Bowl. We have to do what's in the best interest to reset, start over and put us in the best possible position.\n\n\"That's the mindset.\"\n\nAdded Sirianni: \"The goal right now, right this second, is not to get back to the Super Bowl. ... I know everyone is like, 'Well, that's a crazy thing to say.' But our goal is to get better today.\"\n\nSirianni with a new instrument, and he uses it\n\nAs for the first practice, Sirianni for the first time as Eagles coach, had a bullhorn with him, and he ended up using it right away, mostly to yell at the offensive lineman. It was the first time Sirianni used a bullhorn at practice as he's entering his third season as head coach.\n\nThere was one stretch where the second unit O-line was called for three straight pre-snap penalties, something Sirianni yelled at his players about.\n\n\"Fix it!\" he yelled.\n\nOther practice observations\n\nEdge rusher Haason Reddick sat out practice with groin soreness, and he's expected back sometime after this weekend. That gave rookie first-round pick Nolan Smith a chance to start out with the second team, behind Brandon Graham. Smith also got a few first-team reps in the 11-on-11 drills.\n\nOther noticeable first-teamers on defense were Jordan Davis and Milton Williams at defensive tackle, Nakobe Dean and Nicholas Morrow at linebacker, and Reed Blankenship and Terrell Edmunds at safety.\n\nOn offense, Cam Jurgens was with the first team at right guard, as he and rookie Tyler Steen are vying to replace Isaac Seumalo, who left in free agency.\n\nKeep an eye out for the connection between second-string quarterback Marcus Mariota, who twice hooked up with tight end Tyree Jackson during red-zone drills, the first going for a touchdown.\n\nLinebacker Christian Elliss, who was the star of the spring drills, with two INTs in the two sessions open to the media, got off to a good start Wednesday by picking off Mariota. LB Davion Taylor also had an interception, off rookie QB Tanner McKee.\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

All of the pollutants were discharged from the plant's wastewater treatment facility.\n\nAllen Harim, the nation's 21st largest poultry producer, employs more than 1,450 workers at the Harbeson plant, nearly equivalent to the town's total population.\n\nDuring the four-year stretch between March 1, 2012 and Oct. 28, 2016, Allen Harim, on occasion, released as much as eight times the concentration of a chemical permitted under Delaware law. For example, on Oct. 1, Allen Harim discharged 7.36 milligrams per liter of ammonia, more than eight times the daily limit. For the month of Aug. 2016, the amount of discharged ammonia was greater than three times the monthly permit limit, according to the notice of violation DNREC submitted to the company.\n\nThe phosphorus discharges also exceeded required limits. Between Sept. 5 and Sept. 12, 2012, 44 pounds per day of the chemical were discharged, more than double the limit of 23 pounds per day.\n\nOther chemicals found in the discharge included nitrogen, suspended solids, enterococcus and biochemical oxygen.\n\n\"It is apparent that the facility is experiencing intermittent high levels of ammonia entering the [waste water treatment plant], and, at times the [waste water treatment plant] cannot process the increased levels of ammonia to meet permitted effluent limits as stated (in the facility's permit),\" the notice of violation read.\n\nSTORY: Aldi grocery to open two Delaware stores Thursday\n\nSTORY: Retail sales surged in October\n\nEarlier this year, DNREC renewed Allen Harim's discharge permit through 2021. Under the new permit, the company can release up to 2 million gallons of treated wastewater and stormwater a day into Beaverdam Creek.\n\nA DNREC spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"The company has been made aware of intermittent spikes in the levels of ammonia,\" said a statement issued by Allen Harim. \"We will continue to work closely with DNREC and respond to any concerns as we transition into the second phase of our wastewater treatment plant upgrade.\"\n\nAllen Harim is spending $11 million to upgrade the wastewater treatment plant at the Harbeson facility. The wastewater treatment upgrades were part of a $30 million renovation of the Harbeson plant.\n\nA first phase was recently completed, and Allen Harim expects the second phase to begin shortly. Phase II involves the installation of a state-of-the art nutrient removal technology to reduce discharges into the Beaverdam Creek, the company said. The second phase will also include a water reclamation system that will recycle up to one million gallons of water per day.\n\nAllen Harim closed its Cordova, Maryland, processing facility in July. All equipment and transferred its equipment and about 260 workers were transferred to the Harbeson plant.\n\nThe Harbeson plant has also been the target of the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration's investigations.\n\nOSHA has issued multiple safety violations for the processing facility, alleging workers were sent to a first-aid station to avoid property reporting injuries. The agency also claimed the first-aid station was staffed by emergency personnel who were not licensed in Delaware and overseen by an administrator with no training.\n\nAllen Harim is appealing the citations and the $38,000 in fines recommended by OSHA. Company officials said they \"strongly disagree with the factual and legal claims\" made by the federal regulators. Hearings on the violation have twice been postponed and the company has said it is engaged with ongoing discussions with OSHA to resolve the issues outside of the legal process.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.

Luckily, we have an ocean for that, and just in time, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed beach replenishment. Summer lasts only so long, so quit bemoaning the heat and bugs and get on the beach!\n\nEvery week in the summertime, Delaware Online/The News Journal provides this weekend guide to the Delaware beaches. Below, you'll find everything you need to know about beach closures, weather, events and even those pesky beach flies.\n\nLong live summer!\n\nWeather at Delaware beaches\n\nThe humidity dissipated last weekend, making for a lovely couple of days of warm weather without all the sweat. This weekend, the heat and humidity are back.\n\nIt's going to be especially hot at the Delaware beaches, with temperatures in the mid-90s on Friday and Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Friday's max heat index in Bethany Beach is 102 degrees!\n\nThere will be a little relief Sunday, with temperatures in the low 80s. Saturday and Sunday both have a small chance of rain.\n\nTake the heat seriously; it causes more deaths in the U.S. than any other weather-related cause. Children, older adults and the disabled are most at risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the following to prevent heat-related illnesses and deaths.\n\nSeek out air-conditioning. Check on neighbors who don't have it, and if you don't, know where to find it. Libraries usually serve as public cooling stations.\n\nStay hydrated by drinking water and other non-alcoholic beverages frequently.\n\nWear loose-fitting, light-colored clothing.\n\nDon't exercise or perform strenuous activities during the daytime.\n\nNever leave children or pets in cars.\n\nMore heat-related tips:Avoid these risks to dogs this summer as warm weather, pet dangers, amp up\n\nEvents at Delaware beaches\n\nLewes, Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach all offer free concerts throughout the summer. Check your town's website for the schedule and lineup.\n\nBut the Delaware beaches have plenty more to offer. Starting at the southern end, the Freeman Arts Pavilion will host T.3 Friday at 7 p.m. They're a TikTok-viral a cappella trio that sings pop, film and Broadway songs. Saturday at 10 a.m. is The Uncle Devin Show, \"an interactive musical experience for children,\" according to Freeman's website. That evening, check out \"Classic Albums Live: Aretha's Gold,\" and Sunday night, check out The Mavericks, an \"eclectic rock and country group.\"\n\nIn Ocean View, Dickens Parlour Theatre will host magician Rich Bloch and \"The Comedy Tonight Show\" on Friday and Saturday night. On Sunday night, \"The Good Liar\" Brian Curry, a magician and \"mind-reader,\" will begin a nine-night run.\n\nClear Space Theatre Company in Rehoboth Beach has a rotating summer repertoire. This weekend, \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is onstage Friday and Saturday night, and afterward, on Friday night, catch the \"Laughter at the Beach!\" comedy show. There's also a Saturday morning children's theatre production of \"The Wizard of Oz'' (abridged version).\n\nAnd on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tanger Outlets Seaside in Rehoboth Beach will host over 50 local businesses and vendors for a \"Back to School Block Party.\"\n\nHeat warnings:Extreme heat forecast for Delaware this summer. Here's what you need to know\n\nBeach closures\n\nPortions of the Delaware ocean beaches have been closed since April when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began a major replenishment project.\n\nRejoice! Work was completed this week in Bethany Beach and South Bethany, meaning wide, sandy beaches from Rehoboth Beach to Fenwick Island and no more closures.\n\n\"The only work continuing is sand fencing and dune walkway repairs,\" said Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Stephen Rochette.\n\nThere have been a few other sorts of beach closures this summer. The beach at Gordon's Pond in Cape Henlopen State Park closed briefly due to nesting piping plovers, and on Tuesday, the Delaware beaches saw their first water quality advisory of the summer.\n\nLewes development:This prime Lewes property near the beach is finally set to be developed after legal battle\n\nHerring Point beach in Cape Henlopen State Park was under advisory from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control due to high levels of Enterococci bacteria, but levels tested below the standard the next day.\n\n\"These bacteria most likely originate from wildlife sources and increased rainfall, waves or wildlife feeding near the surf (shorebirds, marine mammals or other warm-blooded animals) and can result in these indicator bacteria washing into the near shore waters,\" the advisory said.\n\nWater quality advisories are issued most often in late summer. Delaware Online/The News Journal will notify readers of each one, so check in frequently.\n\nThings to know\n\nSurf-fishing: For the first time this year at the Delaware drive-on beaches, you need a reservation on weekends and holidays. That's in addition to a surf-fishing permit, available at most state park offices.\n\nReservations are $4 per vehicle per day. Most drive-on beaches will likely sell out this weekend, so make your reservation as soon as possible. The online system at destateparks.com/SurfTagSales opens at 11 a.m. Tuesday for Saturday reservations and 11 a.m. Wednesday for Sunday reservations.\n\nMore:Looking for cold treats at Delaware beaches? Here are 3 new places to get them\n\nCurfews: After an increase in issues with teens earlier this month, police in Bethany Beach and Dewey Beach are enforcing curfews. In Bethany Beach, the curfew is 11 p.m. for anyone under the age of 18. It's the same in Dewey, except on Fridays and Saturdays, when the curfew begins at midnight.\n\nBiting beach flies: It's that time of year, and the truth is, there's not much you can do to avoid biting flies on the beach. Except, that is, stay home when the wind is coming from the west. If you're currently under attack at the beach, The Nature Conservancy's Deborah Landau has a few tips.\n\nStay in the shade, where flies are less likely to attack.\n\nDry off as soon as you come out of the water. Flies prefer wet skin.\n\nFlies are attracted to dark colors, so wear a light-colored swimsuit.\n\nRead more about biting beach flies here.\n\nShannon Marvel McNaught reports on Sussex County and beyond.

Make sure to check in with the local lifeguards before you dive in to learn about any potential hazards in the water or on the sand.\n\nRehoboth Beach at Rehoboth Avenue was under a swimming advisory on July 30 due to elevated bacteria levels found in routine water sampling, likely a result of recent rain and wildlife droppings. Another sample has been collected and the advisory will be lifted when bacteria levels drop. The advisory is not a closure, but a warning for sensitive groups.\n\nAt beaches within the Delaware State Parks system, like Cape Henlopen State Park, Fenwick Island State Park and Delaware Seashore State Park near the Indian River Inlet, there are limits on how many people will be admitted.\n\nThe number of vehicles allowed in will be capped at 60% of parking capacity, according to parks officials. Masks or face coverings are required in bathhouse and concession areas at all three parks and strongly encouraged on the beach as well.\n\nAt Cape Henlopen, when the gates are closed, admission also will be restricted for those with surf-fishing tags. Natural resources police will be enforcing the 20-foot minimum distance between vehicles on drive-on beaches.\n\nWhat's open? What's not?\n\nDelaware is in its second phase of reopening businesses previously restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. John Carney announced June 25 that the state was pausing moving into the next phase due to concerns about people not following guidelines.\n\nIn late June, he announced that bar service at the Delaware beaches had to shut down ahead of the Fourth of July holiday weekend.\n\nThis affects taprooms and bar service in the following towns: Lewes, Rehoboth Beach, Dewey Beach, Long Neck, Bethany Beach, South Bethany, Fenwick Island, West Fenwick Island, Ocean View and Millville, according to the order.\n\nCustomers can still get service at tables or outdoors.\n\nCurrent reopening plans allow restaurants to have up to 60% of the people who would be allowed in the building by the fire marshal, not including staff, but they must still adhere to social distancing guidelines. Some have increased outdoor seating to try to accommodate more diners.\n\nCarney's additional restriction on beach bars means bar seating within restaurants is also off-limits. It's unclear when those bar restrictions will be lifted.\n\nPeople are encouraged to call ahead for reservations and to check on any changes in normal operating hours or other restrictions.\n\nThat 60% capacity cap also applies to personal care services (such as hair and nail salons, tanning, tattoo, massage therapy services and spas) that were previously required to keep occupancy at 30%.\n\nNo additional announcements have been made on when Delaware will enter phase three of the state's rolling reopening plan. For more details on the state's reopening, go to governor.delaware.gov/delawares-recovery.\n\nParking\n\nParking permits or metered parking are in effect in all of Delaware's beach towns from Lewes to Fenwick Island.\n\nIn Lewes, city officials are supporting businesses by offering free downtown parking from 9 a.m. to noon for shoppers. Rehoboth Beach is offering free parking on Monday nights until Labor Day, and Dewey Beach also offers free parking on some weeknights. Bethany Beach also is offering free parking from 4-11 p.m. on Tuesdays in August, following by a whole month of free parking in September.\n\nEach town has different rules and rates for parking. For more information, visit an individual beach town's website or call Town Hall in the beach town you plan to visit before arriving.\n\nBelow are links to each oceanfront beach town's parking policies:\n\nTravel and rentals\n\nPrevious bans on out-of-state travelers and short-term rentals were lifted in early June. Delaware's reopening plan says leisure travel \"should be avoided\" at this time, but it's allowed if people and businesses can adhere to social-distancing-related recommendations, according to the state.\n\nIn late July, Delaware was again added to the quarantine lists for a few neighboring states. People traveling from Delaware to New Jersey, New York, Connecticut or Washington, D.C., will be asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nHotels and other accommodations also are now accepting reservations for vacation stays, though there may be limits and restrictions in gathering areas like lobbies.\n\nDelaware's daily DART beach bus service is fully operational. People can take advantage of the Park & Ride options in Lewes and Rehoboth to avoid heavy beach traffic south of Lewes.\n\nFace coverings are required on public transportation.\n\nThe Lewes Park & Ride is at 17616 Coastal Highway, just south of Five Points, and the Rehoboth Park & Ride is off Route 1 at 20055 Shuttle Road, just north of the entrance to Rehoboth Avenue. Parking is free at both lots.\n\nCash-only fare for a one-way trip, due upon boarding, is $2, and an all-day daily pass is $4.20. Seven-day passes also are available for $18, and a 30-day pass costs $65. For more information, go to www.dartfirststate.com/information/programs/beachbus/index.shtml#parkride.\n\nDART's beach connection, which runs from Wilmington to Rehoboth Beach on weekends and holidays, is also now available.\n\nWeather\n\nThis weekend's weather is looking to offer some relief from the heat wave, but will not be picture perfect for a trip to the beach. However, forecasts can change as the weekend gets closer.\n\nThe National Weather Service forecast for Friday, July 31, in Rehoboth Beach is for a rainy, mostly cloudy day with a high near 79 degrees. There is a 70% chance of rain and some thunderstorms.\n\nSaturday will be mostly cloudy with a high near 84 degrees. There is a 30% chance of storms, with the rain most likely to arrive after 1 p.m.\n\nSunday should be partly sunny with a high near 89, though there also is a 40% chance of rain.\n\nWater temperatures off the coast of Lewes are reaching the high 70s this week, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nDelaware's COVID-19 case numbers\n\nAs of July 30, Delaware has seen a total of 14,689 cases since the first case was detected in March, data shows.\n\nOf those cases, 6,743 have been in New Castle County, the most populated county in the state. Another 5,583 have been detected in Sussex County.\n\nThe pandemic has been linked to the deaths of 581 people in Delaware. So far, nearly 180,000 people have been tested statewide, and 8,140 people have recovered from the viral disease.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/29"}]}

Situation – misguided, unfortunate, it was wrong – occurred,\" Marshall said when told about the recording. \"This individual knows it was a mistake and ... regrets it significantly.\"\n\nMarshall also said the individual being investigated is a volunteer, not a paid employee. He declined to provide any other information.\n\n\"This is not the representation we want for the Lewes Fire Department. We are going to do our due diligence,\" Marshall said.\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent history the Lewes Fire Department has dealt with such an issue.\n\nIn 2020, former chief William Buckaloo used a homophobic slur to describe a drag show on social media. The department issued a statement at the time saying Buckaloo had been suspended, pending an investigation. When asked about the outcome of that investigation, Marshall declined to comment.\n\nThe commission has no record of Buckaloo's investigation because the legislature didn't give it the power to oversee firefighter complaints until 2023. Now, the law allows the commission to investigate potential misconduct, however, unless it's deemed necessary to take immediate action \"for serious life-safety issues or to otherwise protect the public,\" the affected fire department resolves the complaint internally.\n\nDepartments have 30 days to resolve complaints, unless the commission grants them more time, according to the Delaware Code. If the commission finds the investigation and/or resolution unsatisfactory, it can then conduct its own investigation.\n\nFioravaniti said he expects to release more information on the Lewes case later this week.\n\nShannon Marvel McNaught reports on southern Delaware and beyond.

With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/01/09/corrections-clarifications/1821023/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications 2020", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWe recognize that mistakes may happen – or that new information can emerge after a story is published – and we pledge to address all concerns quickly, fairly and transparently.

The sentence should have said that lawyers in a criminal trial probably would keep someone off a jury if he or she declared as little impartiality as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has.\n\nNews: An earlier version of this story misidentified the DJI Mavic Air in a photo caption. https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/12/27/apple-iphone-ring-doorbells-and-dji-drones-top-best-decade-gadgets/2748362001/\n\nNews: An earlier version of this story misattributed a quote to Lee Bingham Redgrave. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/01/01/joseph-henry-loveless-dismembered-body-found-idaho-identified-outlaw/2789895001/\n\n2016:Corrections & Clarifications\n\n2017:Corrections & Clarifications\n\n2018:Corrections & Clarifications\n\n2019:Corrections & Clarifications", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/26/summer-snow-yellow-jacket-super-nests-laundered-cat-news-around-states/39622847/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Scientists are cautioning Alabamians to be on the lookout for yellow jacket super nests. Researchers say milder winters combined with an abundant food supply allow some colonies to survive later in the year and grow to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Charles Ray, an entomologist working with the Alabama Cooperative Extension System, says the state may see large numbers of the giant nests this year. Two super nests have already been confirmed, a month sooner than when the first nest was spotted in 2006. During that year, the state had 90 of the nests, which can contain more than 15,000 of the stinging insects. Experts say removal of the colonies is a task that should be reserved for licensed commercial pest control operators.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A summer baseball squad is being threatened by financial troubles. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Peninsula Oilers summer collegiate baseball team is in jeopardy as it struggles to secure funding. The team has won three National Baseball Congress World Series titles and seen 125 of its top college prospects move to the major leagues after playing at Coral Seymour Memorial Park in Kenai, 75 miles southwest of Anchorage. The team is in its 46th consecutive season, but a decline in the Oilers’ major finance sources puts its future in question. The team’s president says the Oilers took in only $55,000 from gambling at its bingo hall and $35,000 from sponsorships in 2018. He says that despite fundraising efforts, the situation “looks bleak right now.”\n\nArizona\n\nKingman: A Mohave County official is calling the overpopulation of burros in the Black Mountain herd management area a crisis. The Kingman Daily Miner reports Chairman Hildy Angius of the Mohave County Board of Supervisors said last week that the conditions of burros is “inhumane,” and many face starvation. Angius said the Black Mountains area can sustain less than 500 burros of 2,000 that call the area home. Officials say the conditions are forcing burros to come down from the mountains to Bullhead City and risk getting hit by cars. Angius said she spoke with Rep. Paul Gosar, a Prescott Republican, and there are congressional hearings promised for this summer and “a large appropriation on the table.”\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The city has approved the state’s first downtown entertainment district where people will be allowed to drink alcohol while wandering around. Mountain Home City Council voted 5-3 on Thursday to open the district July 24. People in the district will be able to walk around the area between 4:30 p.m. and midnight with alcohol in branded plastic cups purchased at restaurants and bars in the district. The cups cannot exceed 16 fluid ounces. It’s still illegal for district patrons to possess an open can, bottle or glass container of alcohol. Also, it’s illegal for entertainment district patrons to drink alcohol inside a parked vehicle. The introduction of the change isn’t expected to cause major problems, police said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature voted Monday to tax most people who refuse to buy health insurance, bringing back to the state a key part of former President Barack Obama’s health care law after it was eliminated by Republicans in Congress. The tax now heads to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who proposed a similar plan in January. The federal Affordable Care Act required everyone to buy health insurance or pay a penalty. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the law, ruling the penalty was a tax. In 2017, Republicans in Congress eliminated the penalty – beginning this year – as part of an overhaul of the federal tax code. The bill passed by Democrats in California would reinstate the tax, effective Jan. 1. No Republicans voted for it. One Democrat in the state Assembly – Rudy Salas Jr. – voted against it.\n\nColorado\n\nRocky Mountain National Park: A high-elevation road that traverses the Rocky Mountains in northern Colorado is closed after a rare summer blizzard left ice and deep snowdrifts. Plows encountered drifts up to 8 feet deep on Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park on Monday. The popular highway reaches 12,183 feet above sea level. Park officials said the road will reopen once conditions improve but didn’t say when that might happen. Wintry weather that lasted through the spring and into summer has kept the road closed longer than normal this year. The highway opened for the first time this season June 5, about a week later than usual. Park officials closed it Friday after another late-season storm brought deep snow, high winds and below-freezing temperatures.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employees will soon have a financial incentive to point out wasteful spending in their agencies. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation creating a new rewards program for workers who suggest savings exceeding $10,000. In return, an employee will receive a 5% payment of the estimated savings, up to $10,000. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. State agencies have until Nov. 1 to designate a program coordinator. Not all suggestions will result in a payout for workers. The bill identifies things like deferred maintenance, personal grievances or complaints, or an individual employee’s compensation on the list of ineligible savings suggestions. Also, ideas that conflict with state or federal law or duplicate a suggestion from another employee are among the types of suggestions ineligible for the payment.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Two craft breweries in the state – Dogfish Head and Revelation – have worked “In Tandem” on a brew for Independence Day. The draft-only collaboration will be released July 4 at Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats and at Revelation Taproom. Each brewery put its own stamp on the strawberry-forward, malty base. Dogfish added nutmeg for a slightly sweet, nutty flavor, while Revelation pumped up the floral aroma with locally harvested lavender from Lavender Fields in Milton. The summer-centric Hefeweizen is also a celebration of independence from motorized travel: To create In Tandem, brewery founders rode their bikes to Magee Farms in Lewes to handpick the strawberries. Profits will benefit the Sussex County Land Trust’s planned Route 9 Trailhead, which marks the halfway point between Dogfish’s Milton brewery and Revelation’s Georgetown facility, which is on the Delaware Rails-to-Trails bike path.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Fourth of July on the National Mall and surrounding areas will bring even more road closures than usual to the city, WUSA-TV reports. President Donald Trump is planning an event at the Lincoln Memorial in addition to the traditional festivities of years prior. The National Independence Day Parade will step off at 11:45 a.m. on Constitution Avenue NW from 7th Street NW to 17th Street NW. Trump’s “Salute to America” at the Lincoln Memorial is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. Gates will open at 3:30 p.m. The annual “A Capital Fourth” happens on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol Building at 8 p.m. Then, the fireworks display is slated to begin at 9:07 p.m. This year, the fireworks are being launched from West Potomac Park and behind the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSarasota: An animal sanctuary has begun a unique yoga program amid the enclosures housing some of its 50 big cats. The Sarasota Herald Tribune reports a recent session sold out at Big Cat Habitat & Gulf Coast Sanctuary. The intent is to provide people with exercise of body and mind through yoga combined with an up-close experience with lions, tigers and other big cats. The event currently is available for 24 people every fourth Saturday. Sanctuary officials say it will be expanded to 50 slots in the near future. The $40 ticket also includes a pass for the entire sanctuary, which houses about 150 animals in total.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has unveiled an ambitious affordable housing plan to counter rising costs and the displacement of longtime residents. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the 43-page plan released Monday lays out a number of citywide policy proposals including zoning changes and developer incentives. Bottoms says it will serve as a blueprint for how the city will deploy $1 billion in public and private funding and create or maintain 20,000 affordable housing units by 2026. She says the city will use public money and land as an incentive to attract private investment, while also pledging to find new government funding. Supporters say it’s one of the most comprehensive plans of its kind in the city’s history. But critics say it lacks specifics, especially about costs and funding sources.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The dramatic rescue of a hiker lost for more than two weeks in a remote island forest is showing how emerging technology is helping search teams more efficiently scour the wilderness for missing people. Hundreds of volunteers used a GPS-enabled trail hiking app on their cellphones to track the paths they walked while looking for Amanda Eller. Search organizers put the GPS data on specialized digital maps to see what areas volunteers had already searched and identify new places for them to look. The technology led them to Eller, alongside a waterfall. She stayed alive for 17 days last month by eating plants and drinking stream water. The software is particularly useful when teams are organizing and tracking the work of large numbers of volunteers.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A new report from the International Rescue Commission finds that the number of refugees resettled in the state has declined by half since 2016. Boise State Public Radio reports in the 2016 fiscal year, Idaho resettled an average of 67 refugees each month. So far this year, the state is averaging about 33 refugees per month. The International Rescue Committee says Idaho is not alone – the number of refugees entering the United States is at a historic low. Zeze Rwasama, director of the Refugee Center at the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, says the decrease in the number of refugees resettled in Twin Falls is affecting people already living there because it means many of them are waiting longer for refugee friends or family members to arrive.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Health officials say they’re adding a screening for a rare hereditary disorder that affects the brain, nervous system and adrenal gland test for all newborn babies in the state. Adrenoleukodystrophy affects about 1 in 20,000 births. The Illinois Department of Public Health began rolling out the test last week. Babies with the disorder can have normal brains at birth, but the disorder can become deadly without treatment. Treatments include adrenal steroid replacement and stem cell transplantation and are effective only during a narrow window. Illinois becomes the 14th state to screen for the disorder.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: A special prosecutor was requested Monday to investigate the fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer in a case that has inflamed tensions between the black community and law enforcement and roiled the Democratic presidential campaign of Mayor Pete Buttigieg. St. Joseph County Prosecutor Kenneth Cotter filed a petition asking a judge to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the June 16 shooting of Eric Logan, 54, by South Bend police Sgt. Ryan O’Neill. Cotter’s petition also revealed that O’Neill had been accused of making “inappropriate racial remarks” as a patrol officer 11 years ago. Buttigieg, who has surged from obscurity to become a top-tier 2020 candidate, left the campaign trail for several days to deal with fallout from the shooting. He faced criticism Sunday from angry residents at an emotional town hall meeting.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: Work on a proposed multimillion-dollar trail connecting Sioux City and Le Mars is expected to begin next year. The PlyWood trail, linking Plymouth and Woodbury counties, will cost an estimated $18 million and span 16 miles, the Sioux City Journal reports. It’s projected for completion in 2025, says Lesley Bartholomew with the PlyWood Trail Committee. Le Mars-based Wells Enterprise, makers of Blue Bunny ice cream company, has pledged $4 million toward the project, and Bartholomew thought more people would be motivated to donate when they saw parts of the trail completed. “It is kind of a wait-and-see attitude for some individuals,” said Bartholomew, who is also the spokeswoman for Wells Enterprise. The committee is also seeking state and federal grants, including one that’s expected to be awarded next month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state will allow transgender people to change their birth certificates so that the documents reflect their gender identities under a legal settlement ending a federal lawsuit. LGBTQ rights advocates said Monday that Kansas now will have a policy on birth certificates in line with most other states’ policies. U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree signed an order Friday to make the agreement binding on Kansas Department of Health and Environment officials. The department issues birth certificates. Four transgender individuals and the Kansas Statewide Transgender Education Project sued last year over the health department’s policy of not allowing transgender residents to change the sex listed on their birth certificates after changing their names legally. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly applauded the agreement and called the old policy “outdated.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city’s police department has launched a website to seek the public’s help in identifying suspects in unsolved cases. A statement from the Lexington Police Department says the site has surveillance images of people suspected of criminal activity whom police haven’t been able to identify. Chief Lawrence Weathers says the site allows the public to see some photographic evidence in cases and submit tips directly to detectives. A majority of the cases on the site will be shoplifting and other thefts, which are the most common criminal activity in Lexington. Police say they will update the site frequently and will continue to highlight significant or noteworthy cases on social media.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A po-boy shop featured in “The Simpsons” and a video by Drake is serving up its last sandwiches this summer. The New Orleans Advocate reports late-night eatery Gene’s Po-Boys is closing its doors at the end of July. Eugene “Gene” Raymond Theriot opened the 24-hour shop in 1968, serving the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood. It got its signature bright pink color 20 years later. But much of the regular crowd didn’t return after Hurricane Katrina, and visitors haven’t been as interested in Gene’s in recent years. Theriot said it’ll be tough to see the shop gone from the neighborhood, but he’s sold out, and the building will be converted to condominiums.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: Gordon and Janice Goodwin are rediscovering their passion for bicycling in their senior years thanks to new electric-assist bikes. The electric motors provide a gentle kick, making it easier for them to pedal up hilly roads around Acadia National Park. They can’t get that experience on Acadia’s bicycle paths, though. The National Park Service classifies their so-called e-bikes as motorized vehicles, relegating them mostly to paved roads clogged with summer traffic. Nationwide, the agency and others that manage public lands keep thousands of miles of trails off-limits to e-bikes. The only exceptions in Acadia are for people who qualify for mobility devices under the Americans With Disabilities Act, says Christie Anastasia, park spokeswoman. The National Park Service may soon loosen its restrictions in the next few weeks.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Democratic Party is asking the board of elections to investigate possible campaign finance violations by Gov. Larry Hogan. An attorney for Hogan’s campaign is calling it a “shoddy political hit job.” Democrats say the Republican took donations from 100 benefactors that were over the legal limit. But Chris Ashby, Hogan’s attorney, says the complaint is “demonstrably false.” The Democrats’ executive director Ben Smith said Hogan’s 2018 campaign raked in more than $200,000 in violation of the $6,000 limit per donor. The Washington Post reports Maryland Sen. Clarence Lam noticed the possible violations after Hogan vetoed a bill to strengthen transparency in the governor’s appointments office. Lam told the Democratic Party, which then found the other possible violations.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill under consideration at the Statehouse is aimed at testing the idea of a universal basic income. The long-shot bill would create a pilot program that would include 100 residents in each of three economically diverse cities or towns. At least one of the communities would be located in a rural part of the state. Everyone participating in the program would receive $1,000 a month for three years and agree to participate in a study. After the three years are complete, the bill calls on the Department of Housing and Community Development to submit a report looking at the effects of the program, including whether a universal basic income could be used to address historic inequalities, including institutional racism.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state is launching a $2 million educational campaign to boost the state’s low recycling rate. The “Know It Before You Throw It” initiative was announced Monday at a recycling transfer station in Lansing. Officials say the goal is to let residents know that they should rinse and dry all plastics, glass and metal before recycling it. People also should not try to recycle plastic bags, as the practice is prohibited by most municipalities. Not recycling properly can contaminate the supply, meaning it goes to landfills or adds costs for communities. The educational campaign includes TV ads, billboards and a website. Michigan’s 15% recycling rate is the lowest in the Great Lakes region, despite the 10-cent bottle-return law.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMaplewood: A cat was left sick, concussed and temporarily blind after a trip in a washing machine spin cycle, needing the help of an oxygen machine to breathe. Stefani Carroll-Kirchoff was doing an extra-large load of laundry and forgot to close the door to the washing machine while folding clothes. Immediately after running another wash, she noticed a little paw sticking out of the washing machine drum – that of her 1-year-old tabby kitty, Felix. “He’s lovable, but he does get himself into trouble,” Carroll-Kirchoff told the Pioneer Press. Felix was found with bruises on his body, Carroll-Kirchoff’s daughter wrote in a GoFundMe page for Felix’s recovery after his trip to the emergency veterinarian. Fortunately, Carroll-Kirchoff chose the express wash, she told the Pioneer Press. It takes less time and might have saved Felix’s life.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new exhibit barn has opened at the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum, years after a fire damaged some buildings. The state agriculture commissioner, Andy Gipson, opened the barn and a maintenance shop Friday at the museum in Jackson. The barn has more than 5,000 square feet of heavy timber construction exhibit space. Ten antique tractors and 15 pieces of historical farm equipment are on display. The maintenance shop has three bays and space for woodworking restoration, automotive repair and restoration, and landscaping needs. Fire swept through the museum in November 2014. An agriculture department news release says the $1.3 million rebuilding project is being paid through insurance claim funds.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is relocating two research agencies to the area, but some researchers are reluctant to move cross-country. The USDA announced plans this month to move the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture closer to farmers and agribusinesses they serve, and many employees have objected to the move from the Washington, D.C., area. Critics say the research agencies have lost veteran employees and been unable to fill vacancies since the USDA announced last year that it was considering moving their headquarters. Opponents also argued that moving them will make it harder for federal policymakers to get objective research that might raise questions about President Donald Trump’s policies. USDA officials say the move will save about $20 million a year, providing more money for research.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A vintage airplane restored by volunteers is back home after participating in events commemorating the 75th anniversary of D-Day. The Missoulian reports about 50 people were waiting to greet Miss Montana when it landed Monday in Missoula after traveling 16,000 miles to six countries. It dropped 19 parachutists over Normandy in two passes and landed in the French countryside as part of the commemoration of the invasion. A few days later, the plane participated in events in Germany marking the 70th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift. The plane was a smokejumper and transport plane and dropped the smokejumpers who died fighting the Mann Gulch Fire near Helena in 1949. It will return to Mann Gulch for the fire’s 70th anniversary Aug. 5.\n\nNebraska\n\nMalcolm: People interested in learning about carp fishing are invited to attend Carp-O-Rama, scheduled for Saturday at Branched Oak State Recreation Area. This free event will run from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Liebers Point. Carp will be used in demonstrations on cleaning, preparing and cooking the fish. The fish then will be served as a free lunch. Other activities include fish printing and Dutch oven cooking demonstrations. Loaner fishing poles will be available. A park entry permit is required of each vehicle entering the recreation area, which sits 4 miles north of Malcolm in Lancaster County. A Carp-O-Rama also has been scheduled for July 20 at Lake Maloney Reservoir State Recreation Area south of North Platte.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: “Jeopardy!” champion and professional sports gambler James Holzhauer lost a bid to win cash for a local charity in two World Series of Poker events. Tournament spokesman Seth Palansky said Tuesday that Holzhauer and Poker Hall of Famer Mike Sexton played about five hours Monday before finishing out of the money in a tag-team tournament. That was Holzhauer’s second event of the day. Earlier, the 32-time “Jeopardy!” winner finished short of the prize pool in 454th place among some 1,800 entrants in a No-Limit Hold’em tournament. Holzhauer had planned to donate half of any winnings to a Las Vegas nonprofit for homeless high school students. Holzhauer became a TV celebrity by winning more than $2.4 million on the game show “Jeopardy!” and has made several charitable donations in recent weeks.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBow: A food bank in the Granite State is once again trying to collect enough peanut butter jars to fill up a pickup truck – as many times as possible. The New Hampshire Food Bank is collecting donations of peanut butter and substitutes such as almond butter from now until Aug. 2. The public can donate the spreads at certain car dealerships around the state. Last year, the inaugural drive collected more than 4,495 pounds of peanut butter, filling four Ford F-150 pickup trucks. The New Hampshire Food Bank is a program of Catholic Charities New Hampshire and receives no state or federal funding for food distribution. The food bank’s executive director, Eileen Liponis, says summer is a tough time for children who usually rely on free and reduced school meals.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s environmental regulators have failed for nearly a decade to meet a legal requirement that they provide a detailed written accounting each year of enforcement actions against polluters of state waterways. The Clean Water Enforcement Act requires the Department of Environmental Protection to issue an annual enforcement report to the Legislature and governor. But the Associated Press found through an open records request that none has been submitted since 2010. The annual reports give officials and the public an easy way to know which companies have been deemed “significant non-compliers,” how many violations were committed, how much in fines was collected and how many criminal cases were pursued. Informed of the findings, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s office says the governor will work to resume the reports.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest city is joining a growing number of communities asking residents to use an app to report illegal fireworks on July 4th instead of calling 911. KOB-TV reports city officials are directing residents to the “OneABQ” app so authorities can streamline complaints instead of dispatching first responders. Albuquerque Fire Rescue spokesman Tom Ruiz says the app sends notices to fire enforcement units when a complaint is made instead of sending first responders going to 911 calls. Officials say last year, when the app was used for the first time, 911 calls reporting illegal fireworks fell by 80% from the year before. “What the main point we want to talk about is – our front line units – we want to keep them as available as possible for the most critical of calls. Life-saving emergencies,” Ruiz said.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: A smaller Woodstock 50 festival could possibly be held at an upstate harness track and casino. Town of Vernon Supervisor Randy Watson tells the Poughkeepsie Journal that Woodstock 50 has applied for a permit to hold its concert Aug. 16-18 at Vernon Downs, about 35 miles east of Syracuse. Watson says the proposed capacity was 45,000-50,000 people – far smaller than the 150,000 planned for at the initial venue, Watkins Glen International. Woodstock concert promoters had no comment Monday. Vernon Downs owner Jeffrey Gural said in an email Monday that officials are close to signing a letter of intent and could host up to 65,000 people, but without camping. The festival has faced a series of setbacks, including Watkins Glen pulling out earlier this month.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The Postal Service Creed covers rain, snow, heat and gloom of night, but it says nothing about snakes on a mailbox. One postal worker who encountered that very thing said the mail delivery could wait until the snake was delivered elsewhere. The Charlotte Observer reports the worker found the snake Friday at a home in Mint Hill near Charlotte. Jennifer Gordon of Carolina Waterfowl Rescue said the nonvenomous Dekay’s brown snake was living in some ivy below the mailbox and climbed up to get some sun. The postal worker wanted it gone before the mail was delivered. Neither the worker nor the family was identified. Rescue workers released the snake in some nearby woods. The owners removed the ivy from the mailbox to prevent a return to sender.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge is ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to turn over more documents that several Native American tribes claim could bolster their lawsuit seeking to shut down the Dakota Access pipeline. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the federal agency was directed to give up the documents by Wednesday. Four Dakota Sioux tribes accused the Corps of withholding dozens of documents that they say could show how the pipeline may threaten a Missouri River reservoir, which serves as their water source. Fears of an oil spill into the river sparked massive protests in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017. Federal officials had turned over some documents but said requests for dozens more were vague or too broad.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Taxpayers in Hamilton County next year will buy $75,000 worth of crickets, grubs, worms, nightcrawlers and minnows. But unlike stadiums and streetcars, tax money for bugs doesn’t generate much controversy. The insects and worms feed the lizards, amphibians and some of the other 500 species of animals at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. The money comes from the zoo levy property tax approved by Hamilton County property owners in 2018. For a homeowner with a $100,000 home, that’s $10.23 a year. The Hamilton County Board of Commissioners in May approved the agreement for how the zoo will spend the $7 million in annual expected proceeds from the property tax through 2022 when the levy expires. Voters in Hamilton County see the zoo as a worthy cause, approving it eight out of nine times since the first Cincinnati Zoo levy in 1982.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A judge has signed off on the state’s $85 million settlement with Israeli-based Teva Pharmaceuticals following a squabble between the attorney general and the Legislature and governor over how the deal was structured. Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman said Monday that he signed the agreement calling for the funds to be used to help abate the state’s opioid crisis. Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders had sought to intervene in the case, arguing the deal didn’t comply with a new state law directing any settlement proceeds into the state treasury. The law was passed last month after lawmakers openly grumbled about how Attorney General Mike Hunter structured the state’s $270 million settlement with Purdue Pharmaceuticals. Oklahoma’s public nuisance lawsuit against consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson is continuing.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Legislature has repealed a nearly 25-year-old law prohibiting new schools, hospitals, jails, and police and fire stations from being built in the state’s tsunami inundation zone. Coastal legislators, who pushed the bill, say the risks of a natural disaster must be weighed against an actual economic disaster already unfolding because of the statute. Rep. David Gomberg, a Democrat from Otis, said without new emergency services buildings, coastal residents and businesses will not be able to get property insurance, and without new schools, property values will fall. Oregon has a 30% chance of experiencing a 9.0-plus magnitude Cascadia subduction zone earthquake in the next 50 years. The quake would be followed by a tsunami similar to the one that devastated eastern Japan in 2011.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: City police must use a person’s chosen name and pronoun when interacting with transgender people, regardless of what is listed on their government-issued identification card. The change is part of a new police department policy announced Tuesday that addresses how police should interact with transgender and nonbinary people. Officials say the policy is meant to serve as a guide for unbiased day-to-day interactions with transgender and nonbinary people, as well as those who are being detained or transported. Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Sullivan says it’s intended “to ensure safe, supportive and respectful interactions” with city’s LGBTQ community. Other guidelines include ensuring transgender people can express a preference for the gender of the officer who searches them.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Sorry, Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, and other fictional characters and celebrities who have received write-in votes in an election. Some state lawmakers don’t want those ballots to count. The Providence Journal reports that the House Judiciary Committee approved legislation Monday requiring people who want to be write-in candidates to file a notice of their intent no later than the Friday before an election. Write-ins are a way for voters to express their displeasure with the official candidates. Mickey Mouse got 309 write-in votes in state elections in 2018. But Miguel Nunes, deputy director of state Board of Elections, told lawmakers tallying write-ins is a “monumental responsibility.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island opposes the measure, saying if passed it “would literally mean that every vote does not count.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Amid a shortage of EMS workers, training programs around the state aren’t turning out the number of graduates needed to fill the gap, new research shows. What’s more, factors such as low pay, long hours and poor working conditions contribute to many leaving the field after just eight years. The research from the South Carolina EMS Association and the South Carolina Office of Healthcare Workforce reveals a troubling trend without some action, says Henry Lewis, president of the EMS Association. On the recruitment side, the main problem is not having enough students enrolled in training programs, he says. There are 15 training programs around the state – nine at technical colleges and six at training centers, according to the study. And the number of students enrolling in entry-level EMT training was substantially lower in the 2017-18 school year than in previous years.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Oglala Sioux tribal leaders say the federal government is providing $10 million in emergency relief to help with damage from springtime flooding on the Pine Ridge Reservation. President Julian Bear Runner said in a statement that federal officials accepted the reservation’s emergency request weeks after it was made. The tribe’s request for an emergency declaration is separate from the state, whose $46 million request was accepted earlier this month. Rapid snow melt and severe weather in March and April caused widespread flooding. Residents were stranded in homes surrounded by water with emergency rescues and supply drop-offs done by boat. Eight thousand residents were left without clean drinking water after floodwaters washed out the rural water system. Gov. Kristi Noem deployed National Guard soldiers to deliver water.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Elvis is coming back to town – Costello, that is. The Rock and Roll Hall of Famer will make his way to the Bluff City to play his namesake Elvis Presley’s Graceland Soundstage on Nov. 15. The show is part of a fall headlining tour for the veteran singer-songwriter and his backing band that is being dubbed “Just Trust Elvis Costello and the Imposters.” The lineup will feature Costello’s longtime backers the Imposters, featuring Steve Nieve on keyboards, Pete Thomas on drums and Davey Faragher on bass, as well as vocalists Kitten Kuroi and Briana Lee, all of whom appeared on his most recent release, 2018’s “Look Now.” Costello’s show at the Graceland Soundstage follows a couple other alternative music bookings at the venue this year, including L.A. punk band X and Midwest anti-folkers Violent Femmes. Tickets for the Elvis Costello show go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday online or by calling (877) 777-0606.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Auto thefts are up 6% in the city as the state launches a new ad campaign urging drivers to lock their vehicles, authorities say. The new statewide “If you like it, lock it” campaign, featuring Texas country singer-songwriter Gary P. Nunn, visited El Paso on Monday. Auto thefts and car burglaries spike in the summer and during the holidays, says Stephen Plummer, public awareness manager for the El Paso Auto Theft Task Force. About 320 vehicles have been stolen this year, Plummer says. The current auto theft rate is far smaller than the more than 100 cars stolen per week that El Paso experienced in the 1980s, he says. “Since then, our numbers have come down drastically,” Plummer says. “But that is no comfort for somebody who has had their vehicle stolen.” Full-size pickups are the most stolen vehicles in town, he says.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Data shows the number of students home-schooled in the state has more than doubled. The Daily Herald reports the Utah State Board of Education recorded more than 16,000 home-school students during the 2015-16 school year, the most recent year with available data. Nearly 17% of the students were in the boundaries of the Alpine School District, about 6% were in the Nebo School District, and nearly 3% were in the Provo School District. The state recorded more than 7,000 home-school students in 2003. The state requires families to submit an affidavit to their school district if they’re home schooling. The families are not required to provide a reason for home schooling or maintain attendance or instruction records.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The outgoing president of the University of Vermont is apologizing for the school’s involvement in eugenics research in the 1920s and 1930s that helped lead to sterilizations. President Thomas Sullivan released a statement Friday calling it “unethical and regrettable.” Last year the university decided to remove a former school president’s name from the library because of his support of the Eugenics Survey of Vermont and its leader, a UVM professor. As part of the eugenics movement, some Vermonters of mixed French Canadian and Native American heritage, as well as poor, rural whites, were placed on a state-sanctioned list of “mental defectives” and degenerates and sent to state institutions. Some had surgery after Vermont in 1931 became one of more than two dozen states to pass a law allowing involuntary sterilizations for “human betterment.”\n\nVirginia\n\nLexington: Tourism in this small town has suffered little in the year since The Red Hen restaurant famously refused to serve President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The Roanoke Times reports that Lexington’s meals and lodging tax revenues are steady, and a survey commissioned by a regional tourism office found the incident didn’t dissuade people from visiting the area. The small restaurant’s co-owner has said she asked Sanders to leave the restaurant in June 2018 at the request of gay employees who objected to how Sanders defended Trump’s desire to bar transgender people from the military. That triggered debate about whether politics should play a role in how administration officials are treated in public. Trump recently announced that Sanders will depart as White House press secretary this month.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: All nine Seattle City Council members have vowed to pursue a “Green New Deal” that a community and environmental groups are pushing for. The Seattle Times reports the council members signed a support letter Monday but haven’t worked out particular policies. The local Green New Deal campaign is calling on City Hall to eliminate Seattle’s climate pollution by 2030, “address historical and current injustices” and create thousands of green, unionized jobs. Activists gathered outside Mayor Jenny Durkan’s office last week to launch the campaign and again Monday. To pay for sweeping changes, the campaign says City Hall should consider adopting a climate-emergency tax on large businesses, tolling downtown streets, putting a climate-emergency levy on the ballot and redirecting money now spent on other initiatives.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBeckley: A new study says a Boy Scouts reserve funnels millions of dollars in revenue into the state each year. The West Virginia University Bureau of Business Economic Research study says the Boy Scouts of America’s Summit Bechtel Reserve in Fayette and Raleigh counties brings in some $28 million in years without a national jamboree. The report says in those years, the reserve supports 280 jobs and injects $1 million into state and local tax coffers. The Register-Herald reports the study says the reserve provides $76 million in economic output, 350 jobs and $1.2 million in tax revenue when the national jamboree is in town every four years. This summer’s World Scout Jamboree isn’t included in the study. Some 50,000 Scouts from more than 150 countries are expected.\n\nWisconsin\n\nViroqua: Farmers are questioning whether growing hemp for grain will ever be profitable in the Badger State but say there could be a future in hemp fiber and CBD products. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has issued more than 1,300 licenses to grow industrial hemp in 2019. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that summer rains last year ruined about 20 Wisconsin farmers’ chances of producing salable hemp grain. Viroqua farmer LaVon Felton says he didn’t sell any of the grain he harvested in 2018, and the endeavor cost him at least $20,000. Agronomist Bryan Parr says Wisconsin’s climate might work better for farmers producing hemp fiber – once that market grows. Parr says hemp for CBD products could also prove lucrative, although farmers say this market is limited, too.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Commercial mushroom pickers in the state will get another month to hunt for tasty treasures in an area that burned in a forest fire. Areas in the Rocky Mountains that have burned recently and received abundant rain and snow are good places to look for morel mushrooms. Bridger-Teton National Forest officials recently instituted a $300 permit for commercial mushroom hunters in a burn area near Bondurant in western Wyoming. The permits were valid through July 3. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest managers have extended the season, allowing commercial picking to continue until Aug. 1. People picking for personal use don’t need a permit but can’t collect more than 3 gallons per day.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/13/golden-spike-anniversary-lake-monster-mister-rogers-news-around-states/39474531/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The funeral for one of the first black members of the state Legislature will be held in the same church where his daughter died in a racist bombing in 1963. A service for Chris McNair will be held Friday at 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. McNair’s daughter, Denise McNair, was among four black girls killed when Ku Klux Klansmen bombed the church Sept. 15, 1963. A surviving daughter, Lisa McNair, said Friday that her father planned his funeral and wanted it held at the church. She says he appreciated the historical significance of the church. Chris McNair became one of the first African-American members of Alabama’s Legislature since Reconstruction when he was elected in 1973. He died Wednesday at age 93.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The mysterious animal people say they see in Iliamna Lake is dark, longer than 15 feet, with a long head and tail and distinct fins. It isn’t a whale or a seal, and it often vanishes quickly. Fishermen have tried hooking it. The Anchorage Daily News once offered $100,000 for proof of its existence. But so far, nobody has photographed the creature some call the Iliamna Lake monster. Palmer resident Bruce Wright, a former marine ecologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service, hopes to solve the riddle once and for all this summer by sinking an underwater video camera to the bottom of the sprawling, sparsely lake, the largest and one of the deepest in the state. People call Iliamna Lake an inland sea. It’s 80 miles long, with a rare population of freshwater harbor seals that scientists believe moved in from the ocean long ago, and an old legend that something large lives in its 1,000-foot depths.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The public is sending mixed messages to the U.S. Forest Service about the future of a popular but primitive recreation area in central Arizona. Some people are calling for more infrastructure improvements at Fossil Creek near Camp Verde, while others want more solitude. The Arizona Daily Sun reports Forest Service officials are analyzing the nearly 220 public comments submitted for the development of a long-term management plan. It’s expected to be complete early next year. Fossil Creek project manager Marcos Roybal says some people want more parking, restrooms and other infrastructure projects, while others are concerned about the possible negative effects of increasing visitor numbers. According to agency data, Fossil Creek averages nearly 8,000 visitors a month between May and October when permits are required.\n\nArkansas\n\nHot Springs: The state’s first dispensary has opened two and a half years after voters approved a measure legalizing medical marijuana for certain qualifying conditions. About 100 people lined up in the rain outside Doctor’s Orders RX in Hot Springs on its first official day of business Saturday, as wait times and confusion about the dispensary’s hours frustrated some people. Despite reports that the dispensary was scheduled to open at 8 a.m., employees said they didn’t plan on opening until 10 a.m. One employee also said he expected to process no more than six patients an hour through the state-required electronic tracking system. Some people said they’d been in line since before dawn. On Friday, the state approved another dispensary, Green Springs Medical, and owner Dragan Vicentic has said he plans to open Monday morning.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOjai: This artsy Southern California city is so safe that a single attempt by teens to steal beer accounted for the majority of its violent crimes last year. Sheriff’s Capt. James Fryhoff says that “a beer run that went bad” accounted for four of the six crimes. The teens allegedly went into a gas station mart to steal beer and used a skateboard to beat an employee who confronted them and hit a witness who called 911. That tallied up as two robberies and two assaults with a deadly weapon. Fryhoff serves as police chief of Ojai, a community of just under 7,700 residents in a scenic valley northwest of Los Angeles. It’s best known for galleries, boutiques and outdoor recreation that draw tourists.\n\nColorado\n\nAlamosa: Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve has been recognized for its unpolluted views of the night sky. KOAA-TV reports the International Dark-Sky Association announced Thursday that it has designated the southern Colorado park as an International Dark Sky Park. Park Superintendent Pamela Rice says the park is an ideal place to view the stars because of its dry air, high elevation and lack of light pollution. The park is planning to hold a celebration of the recognition this summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNewtown: A school violence prevention program started by parents whose children were killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre is receiving a $25,000 donation. The gift from the Wireless Zone Foundation will be presented to Sandy Hook Promise on Monday. The donation is earmarked to support the training of youth and adults in Sandy Hook Promise’s Know the Signs program, which is designed to help decrease violence, bullying and other forms of victimization, while strengthening school communities. More than 7.5 million people in more than 14,000 schools and youth organizations have gone through the training, learning techniques to reduce bullying and cyberbullying and help identify those as risk to commit violence, including school shootings.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes Beach: Residents of this beach community have the usual concerns about parking and littering as the summer tourism season begins. But the residents of Lewes Beach are also concerned that beach visitors will continue using the dunes as an outhouse. Lifelong resident JuneRose Futcher says residents are “very worried about the public toileting.” She says the city of Lewes needs to look after residents first. When residents confront people going to the bathroom in the dunes, Futcher says they don’t care. Town officials say there’s no room for more parking or public bathrooms. Resident Mark Schaeffer says a comprehensive land use plan would help Lewes Beach, which has homes ranging from quaint coastal cottages to waterfront villas that list for about $2 million.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A Jordanian American writer is facing a backlash after she posted a picture on Twitter of a public transit worker eating on a Washington Metro train and reported details about the employee to her bosses. Natasha Tynes apologized a day later on Twitter and deleted her post before making her account private. But people online were upset that someone who calls herself a “minority writer” would shame a black woman and possibly cause her to lose her job. The Washington Post reports the publishing house distributing her debut novel dropped her, and her publisher delayed the book’s planned release. Union officials say the woman was on the train to get to another assignment and had just 20 minutes to eat. Tynes told the Associated Press on Sunday that she didn’t want to talk.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has vetoed a bill that would have prevented local governments from banning plastic straws. DeSantis rejected the environmental regulation bill Friday, marking his first veto since taking office this year. The legislation originally addressed issues with contaminated recyclable materials but was amended to include a moratorium on local regulations of single-use plastic straws until 2024. A legislative analysis of the bill lists 10 Florida cities with straw bans, including Miami Beach, St. Petersburg and Fort Lauderdale. DeSantis wrote in the veto that the bans hadn’t frustrated any state policy or harmed state interests. He said the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is encouraging residents to reduce plastic straw use, and residents who oppose the bans should elect new city commissioners.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Executives from three production companies say they won’t film in the state because of its “heartbeat” abortion ban. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports they include David Simon of Blown Deadline, Christine Vachon of Killer Films and Mark Duplass of Duplass Brothers Productions. The boycotts aren’t likely to have an immediate effect because the companies don’t regularly work in Georgia. Killer Films and Duplass Brothers Productions specialize in independent films. Simon’s company has produced HBO series such as “The Wire.” The Georgia law will ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, usually about six weeks into a pregnancy. Critics say it’s unconstitutional and have vowed to sue. The Motion Picture Association of America represents major studios and is taking a wait-and-see approach.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Legislation meant to protect the state’s shark population was altered at the 11th hour to remove the apex predators from the bill amid concerns from the scientific community. West Hawaii Today reports the bill was intended to extend protections already in place for manta rays to include all rays and sharks. It would have made it illegal to “capture, take, possess, abuse, or entangle any shark, whether alive or dead, or kill any shark, within state marine waters,” the measure says. There were exceptions for academic research, but the scientific community found them inadequate. University of Hawaii shark researcher Kim Holland said that researchers would be forced to apply for state permits from personnel without scientific expertise and that the bill was too ambiguous in defining terms like “harassment.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s the perfect time of year for morel mushrooms to start springing up in the state as soil temperatures warm, and already competition to find the tasty, coveted fungi is heating up. Members of online Idaho morel-hunting groups have been posting their finds for a few weeks, the Idaho Statesman reports. Excited commenters will ask at what elevation the honeycomb-capped mushrooms were found and perhaps what region of the state. But there’s one question you’d better not bother asking: Where’d you find them? “If you have to ask … you will never know,” one commenter wrote in a Facebook group for Idaho morel hunters. In the world of morels, much like in fishing, game hunting or even huckleberry picking, the whereabouts of fruitful caches are kept secret.\n\nIllinois\n\nEvanston: An escaped pet snake that apparently slithered into a suburban Chicago family’s washing machine ended up smelling like fabric softener after going through the wash. Sanela Kamencic tells WMAQ-TV she was “totally creeped out” when the snake turned up Wednesday in the washing machine in Evanston. Police Officer Pedro Carrasco and Animal Control Warden Jason Pound brought the reptile to the Chicago Exotics Animal Hospital. Carrasco says it was “peeking its head out of the washing machine” when it was found. Pound says it “smelled like Downy” after surviving the wash cycle. Veterinarian Melissa Giese tells radio station WBBM the snake was “in pretty good shape” and “really feisty.” The animal hospital says the corn snake, named Penelope, belonged to a 12-year-old boy who lives nearby. They were reunited afterward.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An elephant at the Indianapolis Zoo has tested positive for a virus that killed two other elephants at the zoo in March. Kedar, a 13-year-old male African elephant, tested negative for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus until May 6, the zoo said. Zoo staff had been testing elephants twice a week for the virus since the deaths of Kalina and Nyah. “Kedar is receiving aggressive treatment to help him fight the virus,” said Dr. Rob Shumaker, president of the zoo, which is now conducting daily blood tests on all the elephants in its herd. The virus causes fatal hemorrhagic disease in elephants, mainly Asian elephants. It is one of the most devastating viral diseases in elephants. There is no vaccine for it, and it is not preventable. It has an 85% mortality rate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A new building in the East Village neighborhood is the first in the U.S. built using a unique type of mass timber – an eco-friendly material becoming more popular as developers look to reduce their carbon footprints. Mass timber is made by pressing smaller planks of wood together. It can be glued or nailed. In this case, the timber was pressed together using dowels. There are about 200 mass timber buildings across 36 states, but the Des Moines building was the first to use the dowel-laminated product. About 11% of global carbon emissions each year come from concrete and steel manufacturing, says Mark Wishnie, director of forestry and wood products for The Nature Conservancy, and “you also create a new carbon storage pool” with mass timber. During photosynthesis, trees absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The carbon stays in the wood, even after the tree is cut down.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A government report forecasts a bountiful winter wheat harvest in the state. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported Friday that this year’s wheat crop is expected to be up 17% from a year ago. It predicted Kansas growers would bring in 323 million bushels. The agency forecast the state’s average yield at 49 bushels per acre, up 11 bushels from last year. It also anticipated that grain would be harvested from 6.6 million acres in Kansas, down 700,000 acres from a year ago. The government’s estimate is a bit more optimistic than the one put out by participants in last week’s winter wheat tour who estimated the size of the Kansas crop at 306.5 million bushels.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A historic commission says a Confederate statue can be removed from a prominent location. The Louisville Metro Landmarks Commission voted 5-3 on Thursday to allow removal of John B. Castleman’s monument from a neighborhood traffic circle. Hours later, the statue was vandalized with paint for the fifth time since a 2017 deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The commission’s decision is final unless it’s appealed to a Circuit Court within 30 days. Castleman was a Confederate soldier and later a U.S. general. He helped found Louisville’s park system. Mayor Greg Fischer’s administration has pushed to relocate the statue because of Castleman’s ties to the Confederacy and support of slavery. The city is working to move the statue to Cave Hill Cemetery, where Castleman is buried.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Hank Williams’ iconic “Jambalaya (On the Bayou)” won’t become one of the state’s official songs. Republican Sen. Norby Chabert, of Terrebonne Parish, told The Advocate he’s shelving the proposal for this legislative session. Louisiana already has two official state songs: “Give Me Louisiana” and “You Are My Sunshine.” Chabert’s proposal chafed some who objected to adding another song, particularly those who love “You Are My Sunshine.” It was sung by Jimmie Davis, a country singer from Jackson Parish who served two terms as governor. Williams released “Jambalaya” in 1952, and it was the best-selling record for 14 weeks. It’s often played at Louisiana functions, particularly in southern parishes, because of its celebration of the region’s culture.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state is turning 200, and officials want to make sure the Pine Tree State celebrates the big birthday with the best flag possible. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap is asking the public for input on three proposed designs for the commemorative flag, which will be on display around the state in 2020. Maine became a state in 1820. Dunlap is charged with presenting a final decision about the flags to the Legislature and Maine Bicentennial Commission. The state says the result of the public vote will play a major role in Dunlap’s decision. Dunlap says the voting has begun, and it is scheduled to end at 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Ever since a townhome developer in the 1980s dug up a cemetery on the former grounds of the county’s first African-American church, two skeletons have been sitting in boxes archived in a museum. After searching for decades, historian Janice Hayes-Williams’ new mission is to get the remains back to their proper resting place in Annapolis and restore dignity for black families whose neighborhood was destroyed by gentrification. The plan for the return relies on extracting DNA and matching it with the living ancestors of those buried on the property that is now home to City Gate Lane townhouses. County Executive Steuart Pittman and Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley plan to ask Gov. Larry Hogan to put Maryland State Highway Administration Chief Archaeologist Julie Schablitsky on the case.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A performing arts group has found the child who was literally wowed by a recent classical music concert. The Handel & Haydn Society had just finished a rendition of Mozart’s “Masonic Funeral” at Symphony Hall when a youngster blurted out: “WOW!” The group was so charmed that it launched a search for the “Wow Child” with the help of audio of the moment captured by WCRB-FM. The child is 9-year-old Ronan Mattin, of New Hampshire, WGBH-FM reports. He attended the concert with his grandfather Stephen, who saw a report on TV about the society looking for the child. Stephen Mattin said Ronan is on the autism spectrum and expresses himself differently from how other people do. He said his grandson is a huge music fan. The society will invite Ronan and his family back to the venue in October, when the 2019-2020 season opens, for another Mozart performance.\n\nMichigan\n\nMuskegon: A museum housed on a World War II-era warship is bringing a massive anti-aircraft gun aboard. The USS LST 393 Veterans Museum in Muskegon is adding an 18,000-pound anti-aircraft cannon to its landing ship tank this summer. The Muskegon Chronicle reports that the Bofors twin-barreled anti-aircraft cannon is currently being restored. The museum aims to have the gun lifted onto the ship ahead of the celebration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which will be held June 1-2. Board member John Stephenson says the museum has searched for a Bofors cannon since 2005. The warship would’ve carried multiple Bofors when entering battle during World War II. It was part of the Allied Forces’ D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, that weakened the Nazi’s hold on Western Europe in 1944.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The top Republican in the state Senate, who helped defeat a proposed ban on so-called gay conversion therapy for minors, sent his daughter to a therapist opposed to gay relationships after suspecting she had a same-sex attraction when she was a teenager, the Star Tribune reports. Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, a conservative Christian from Nisswa, led his caucus in voting down a Democratic proposal May 1 against the practice of trying to turn gay people straight. Genna Gazelka, 30, who uses the pronoun “they” and now identifies as bi-gender, recalled being sent to a therapist who decried same-sex relations. The therapist was Marcus Bachmann, the husband of former U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, a fiery conservative Christian who ran for president in 2012. “This is harassment, and it is tantamount to what could be said of torture or sexual torture,” Genna Gazelka said of conversion therapy.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: A total of 28 counties and cities in northeast Mississippi have criminalized the possession and sale of kratom, a legal but unregulated herbal product. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the governments are being urged to action by the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and a Columbus-area anti-Kratom group. Bills to ban the substance statewide failed this year in the Legislature. Kratom is produced from the leaves of a tropical tree and consumed as a powder, a liquid or capsules. Supporters of kratom say it provides safe, non-addictive pain relief and can also combat anxiety disorders. Some kratom users also say it manages the withdrawal symptoms of potent opiate drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said the substance may be addictive and prone to abuse.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The city’s school district has found its public and charter schools are increasingly racially segregated, expensive to operate and losing high school students. KCUR-FM reports the district released a new analysis showing that 78% of schools in the Kansas City system were racially segregated by 2017, well over the 32% of schools in 1999. The report says it’s in part due to white families opting out of the system. Only 10% of the city’s public school students are white. The analysis also says Kansas City spends $80 million more on administration, transportation and overhead than the comparably sized Springfield district. The report attributes high costs to inefficiencies from operating 83 schools, compared to Springfield’s 53. Public schools have been losing nearly half of all students between kindergarten and 12th grade.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock signed a series of bills Friday that allow for spending nearly $400 million on buildings, bridges and water systems across the state – an effort aimed at creating jobs, boosting the state’s economy and clearing up a backlog of needed work. The bills include money to repair or replace 14 bridges and 51 water, wastewater and sewer projects. Overall, the 2019 Legislature passed $2.7 billion in infrastructure projects, including highway projects. Other projects include $25 million for long-sought renovations to Romney Hall at Montana State University; a dental hygiene lab at Great Falls College; and backlogged maintenance at state buildings, including $2 million for the state Capitol complex.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A new report says a nearly $200 million decline in the state’s agricultural exports in 2017 was driven by President Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The Nebraska Farm Bureau report attributes the drop to decreases in soybean and corn exports, while beef and pork exports both increased in 2017. The bureau’s senior economist, Jay Rempe, says Trump’s talks of tariffs in January 2017 caused a decline in soybean and other commodity prices. Rempe points out that China’s retaliatory tariffs didn’t occur until May 2018. Rempe says Nebraska’s agricultural community will continue to face pressure unless the administration resolves its trade disputes with China, Mexico and other countries.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor signed a law Friday opening the books on those awarded lucrative licenses to sell recreational marijuana, prompting the state tax department to reveal that just 16 applicants won all 61 new pot dispensary licenses awarded last year. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said the measure ushers in a “new era of transparency that will benefit the industry and the public alike.” The new law makes public the identity of marijuana license applicants and the method the state uses to score and rank bids. The licensing process has faced complaints from companies who say it is not clear what criteria officials used to award licenses. In lawsuits, the companies accuse the state of unconstitutionally picking winners and losers for the marijuana licenses. Sisolak declined Friday to comment on specifics of the pending litigation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: The Department of Environmental Services has closed the state’s ocean coastline and Hampton-Seabrook Harbor to shellfish harvesting because of a toxin that comes from what’s known as red tide. New Hampshire Public Radio reports the DES found high levels of the toxin, which causes paralytic shellfish poisoning. It was recently found in mussel samples. Chris Nash, shellfish program manager at the department, says it comes from toxic algae. The waters will be closed for the rest of May, which will affect soft shell clamming season. Some oyster harvesting areas remain open in Great Bay and Little Bay. The DES says paralytic shellfish poisoning is a life-threatening syndrome. It says the onset of symptoms is rapid, usually within two hours of consumption. Symptoms include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech and respiratory paralysis.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A microorganism that played a role in treating tuberculosis is now officially recognized as the state microbe. Gov. Phil Murphy signed a bill Friday giving the distinction to Streptomyces griseus. The microbe was discovered in New Jersey soil in 1916. In 1943, researchers from Rutgers University used the microbe to create the antibiotic streptomycin. Tuberculosis death rates in the U.S. plummeted. They fell from about 194 deaths per 100,000 people in 1900 to about 9 deaths per 100,000 people in 1955. Rutgers researcher Selman Waksman was awarded the 1952 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering the microbe and creating the antibiotic.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRio Grande del Norte National Monument: Rafting and angler guides are predicting a good season for Rio Grande tourism in the state thanks to strong runoff generated by a good snowmelt this year. A healthy snow patch this winter is feeding the Rio Grande with much-needed water after long dry spells stemming from drought, the Santa Fe New Mexican reports. This year, the National Weather Service in Albuquerque predicts runoff to be at least 148% of normal through June. Water levels were 50% of normal in 2018. Parts of rivers were bone dry or only inches high. Fish – such as trout in the Pecos River – died off, and long sandbars formed along once-wet areas. In addition to tourism, strong runoff is predicted to help the ecosystem around the river and its banks. University of New Mexico biology researcher Rebecca Bixby says the increased flow will help the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow lay eggs and spawn.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The workers who spent their time helping with recovery efforts at ground zero are being commemorated on special-issue transit system MetroCards. The cards will be available starting Wednesday at 10 subway stations, mostly in the area of the World Trade Center site, the Daily News reports. The special MetroCards are connected to the upcoming opening of a glade at the national Sept. 11 memorial that pays tribute to the rescue and recovery workers. The 9/11 Memorial Glade is scheduled to formally open May 30, the anniversary of the day in 2002 when the recovery effort was officially ended. The MetroCards include images of four different people who worked at the site.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNew Bern: Almost 2,000 students will receive scholarships to take a field trip to Tryon Palace, the state’s first permanent capitol. Tryon Palace officials say 1,775 students at 16 Title I schools will receive scholarships to visit the historic site. Title I schools meet certain guidelines for the number of students who are economically disadvantaged. The Tryon Palace Foundation raised the money for the field trips with donations from individuals. The foundation president says the field trips are important because experiencing history is different from merely reading about it. Most of the schools receiving the scholarships are in eastern North Carolina. Applications to attend a field trip next year will be accepted Aug. 15 through Sept. 30.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: An imitation B-52 bomber and an oil derrick will be showcased in the proposed Magic City Discovery Center, according to recently unveiled concept plans. The Minot Daily News reports that the children’s museum’s board president, Mark Lyman, says the project has raised nearly two-thirds of the $7 million needed for the three-story, 22,000-square-foot facility. Lyman says groundbreaking will happen on a gill just south of the Minot airport once the project has raised 75% to 80% of the intended funding target. Paul Orselli, chief instigator with POW!, detailed a 35-foot climbing structure with a B-52 at the top that will be viewed through the multi-story, glassed-in atrium.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: French and American teams are working together again on a D-Day project, this time to allow some virtual time travel back to that decisive moment in world history. Visitors to the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton can use French-developed tablet technology when the museum begins its commemorations of D-Day on Monday. Events include paratroopers dropping from a vintage plane flying overhead and showings of movies about the June 6, 1944, assault that helped end World War II. Tablets called HistoPads let users contrast current views of historic sites with detailed re-creations of them, enhanced in this case with video footage, photos and maps from 1944. This will be the first U.S. site for HistoPads.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Corrections is asking federal lawmakers to authorize the use of cellphone signal jamming technology after being bombarded by an overflow of smuggled cellular devices they say gangs use to commit crimes inside and outside prison. The Oklahoman reports that since 2011, the Corrections Department has seized over 48,500 prohibited cellphones, including almost 1,800 since January. In 2016, correctional officers removed a record high of 9,766 cellphones. Corrections officials across the U.S. have cited cellphones as a reason for violent crimes behind bars and on the streets.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state Supreme Court disagreed with more than 50 years of state case law by ruling that Oregonians retain a privacy interest in the garbage they leave on the curb for pickup. That means police can’t simply rummage through it even after a truck hauls it away. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports the court wrote Thursday that the state’s residents have a reasonable expectation that after they leave their trash in opaque bins covered with a lid, no one will inspect it without a warrant. The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Tracy Lynn Lien and Travis Allen Wilverding, who shared a home and were convicted of methamphetamine dealing after police from Lebanon asked the community’s garbage hauling company, Republic Services, to pick up and set aside the contents of the pair’s garbage on collection day in 2014.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLatrobe: Residents of Fred Rogers’ home state will be encouraged to exhibit acts of kindness in honor of the beloved PBS children’s show host. Gov. Tom Wolf said Friday that the state’s website will share stories of good deeds and kind gestures May 23 for “1-4-3 Day,” named for Mister Rogers’ favorite number. Rogers used the number 143 to say “I love you,” as each digit reflects the number of letters in each word in the phrase. May 23 is the 143rd day of the year. The Fred Rogers Trail highlights locations in his hometown of Latrobe and in Pittsburgh, where “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” was produced. The show aired from 1968 to 2001. Rogers, an ordained minister, is buried at Latrobe Presbyterian Church. He died in 2003 at age 74.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: The yogurt company Chobani plans to pay the school lunch debts of low-income families with students attending a district that made headlines by announcing children who owe money would get cold sunflower butter and jelly sandwiches instead of a hot meal, the mayor’s office confirmed Friday. Mayor Joseph Solomon’s office said it’s coordinating with Chobani to accept nearly $50,000, the amount owed by low-income families with children in Warwick Public Schools. Chobani founder and CEO Hamdi Ulukaya tweeted Thursday that as a parent, the news broke his heart. Access to nutritious food should be a right, not a privilege, he said. Chobani was but one of the businesses and organizations that offered to donate money to the district, officials said. After a public backlash, Warwick Public Schools reversed the cold-lunch decision last week.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The city’s police agency says it is using technology to combat and reduce gun violence. During a news conference Friday, the Columbia Police Department announced it’s using ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection technology that uses acoustics to detect, locate and alert law enforcement about gunfire in real time. Officials say data is transmitted wirelessly and verified, triangulated and reported to police within approximately 45 seconds. Police Chief Skip Holbrook says the city council approved the department’s acquisition of the technology in September 2018, and it has been implementing the system north of the capital city. He says it’s currently the only agency using the technology. Holbrook says police have received 131 alerts, detected 339 shots and seized 11 firearms since deploying the technology April 18.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: An animal rights group is asking Gov. Kristi Noem to reconsider her decision to shoot off fireworks at Mount Rushmore for the Fourth of July celebration in 2020. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said Friday that its president sent a letter to Noem suggesting she consider replacing the fireworks with a drone show. The letter from Ingrid Newkirk said fireworks can scare animals and start wildfires, among other hazards. Newkirk said drone shows are safer and don’t cause pollution. Noem spokesman Joshua Shields called PETA’s suggestion “puzzling” and said forest animals might not react well to “hundreds of drones buzzing and blinking” around the monument at night.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Supreme Court has ruled that city school districts don’t have to share money they receive from liquor taxes with county governments. News outlets report the opinion this week settles five lawsuits filed by Blount, Bradley, Sullivan, Washington and Coffee counties. State law calls for the Department of Revenue to keep half the proceeds from liquor-by-the-drink taxes for general education funds and return the other half to the originating city or county. The counties argued that the state law required cities to share the revenue with counties. The Supreme Court disagreed. Justice Holly Kirby wrote that since cities make the money, they are entitled to the proceeds. The ruling applies to all 95 counties and 43 cities that operate independent school districts.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Federal Aviation Administration has not passed a new safety regulation that legislators say would fortify supervision of the hot-air balloon industry and help avoid fatal crashes similar to a crash that killed 16 people in the state almost three years ago. The agency’s indecision triggered an irritated response from Texas U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who sent a letter to the FAA’s acting administrator asking what was causing the extended delay, the Houston Chronicle reports. Doggett helped create bipartisan legislation that requires medical exams for commercial balloon pilots, who have been exempt from health screenings since the 1930s. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the balloon’s pilot was as impaired by prescription medications as a drunk driver when he ignored weather warnings and flew the ride into a power line.\n\nUtah\n\nPromontory: Music, bells and cannon fire rang out Friday at a remote spot in the desert where the final spikes of the Transcontinental Railroad were hammered 150 years ago, uniting a nation long separated by vast expanses of desert, mountains and forests. An estimated 20,000 people swarmed to the celebration at Golden Spike National Historic Park northwest of Salt Lake City – the signature event of several days of festivities marking the railroad’s anniversary. Visitors came from as far as China, many decked out in old-fashioned dresses, top hats, bonnets and scarves. The event included a re-enactment of an iconic “champagne toast” photo of railroad workers perched atop facing stream locomotives giving cheers to the epic feat. The festivities also highlighted the vital contribution of the Chinese workers who put in long hours in brutal conditions and haven’t always received their proper due throughout history.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Queen City doesn’t get a lot of sunlight but makes up for it in other ways. The city is nestled in Chittenden County, which gets some of the lowest average levels of sunlight per day, according to AccuWeather. However, Burlington manages to take advantage of as many sun rays as possible using solar panels. The city takes the fourth spot on a list by AccuWeather of solar energy per capita. Honolulu took the highest place. AccuWeather points out that the city managed to earn the title of “America’s First All-Renewable-Energy,” according to Politico.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Hershey Company has picked the state for a major expansion of its manufacturing operation. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Thursday that the candy maker plans a $104 million expansion at its facility in Augusta County. The expanded facility will manufacture a type of fudge and peanut cream. The new project is expected to create 65 new jobs. Northam approved $1 million in state grants for the project. Hershey brands include Reese’s, Kit Kat and Jolly Rancher.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state is set to become the first to enter the private health insurance market with a universally available public option. A set of tiered public plans will cover standard services and are anticipated to be up to 10% cheaper than comparable private insurance, thanks in part to savings from a cap on rates paid to providers. Unlike existing government-managed plans, the Washington plans are set to be available to all residents regardless of income by 2021. The Legislature approved the measure creating the plans last month, and Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to sign it into law Monday. The move also thrusts the state into the national debate over the role of government in health care, with a hybrid model that puts it to the left of market-only approaches but stops short of a completely public system.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: He’s a billionaire who owns mines, farms and a resort. But how Jim Justice spends his time as the state’s 36th governor has largely been a mystery. Since taking office in 2017, critics have said Justice is rarely at the Statehouse and called his business portfolio distracting. He’s pushed back on those claims. His schedule for the past seven months was recently released to the Associated Press through an open-records-law request. It shows he rarely meets with his Cabinet, rarely is at the Statehouse and was largely missing at one of the legislative session’s most critical points. His office said Justice wasn’t available for an interview but released a statement. Justice says his calendar doesn’t reflect the time and work he puts in as governor. His lawyer says Justice doesn’t log most of his office time.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Medical College of Wisconsin is looking for ways to fight racial disparity in cancer deaths in the state. The National Cancer Institute reports that black residents in Wisconsin get cancer at a 22% higher rate than do white residents. Factors leading to cancer disparities for African Americans include stress, income, lifestyle and poor diet. Biological differences and medical access also contribute. Lauren Matthews has focused on the problem for three years as a community program coordinator at the college. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that the college has launched a program offering free prostate screenings for black men. The program also provides community education about cancer screening. The college also is studying breast cancer, colorectal cancer and smoking with funding help from the Greater Milwaukee Foundation.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Volunteers are clearing dead trees and repairing fences along a former railroad right of way that’s been converted to a trail in southern Wyoming. The Laramie Boomerang reports the Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail group is working with the Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest to maintain the route, which winds 21 miles from Lake Owen to the Colorado border. The lake is 40 miles southwest of Laramie. Friends of the Medicine Bow Rail Trail President Dave Nelson says he and other cyclists frequently encountered dead trees on the trail, many killed by beetles. Members have been volunteering on the trail for years, and last year they formed a nonprofit that can accept donations and apply for grants. Forest Service spokesman Aaron Voos says such groups do invaluable work for the agency.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/10/animation-behind-bars-elliott-elk-beagle-bill-news-around-states/40105781/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A free music festival held in the city’s downtown the past four years is being canceled. A statement from DMG Productions Inc. says the TenSixty festival won’t be held next month as expected. The statement blames a lack of sponsor money for the decision and says organizers hope to resume the festival in the future. TenSixtyFive began in October 2015 after the abrupt cancellation of the BayFest festival in Mobile. Organizers pulled the replacement event together in just a few weeks, and it’s been held annually since. Acts last year included Big Boi, Walker Hayes and Wet Willie. The statement says more than 100,000 people attended over four years.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Russian adventurer Anatoly Kazakevich sailed into town on a double-hulled inflatable sailboat last week, completing the last leg of an 8,000-mile journey from the Siberian city of Irkutsk. Kazakevich and his crew, which ranged between two and six members along the route, sailed the inflatable catamaran Iskatel across the North Pacific Ocean to Homer, Alaska, last year. After wintering in south-central waters, the Iskatel (which means “searcher”) brought Kazakevich to Sitka last week to mark the completion of his Baikal-Alaska Expedition. Kazakevich described his journey as a “historical geography expedition” and said that “before us, nobody did this (route) for 150 years.” Colonial-era journeys of Russian explorers in the 18th and 19th centuries were the inspiration for Kazakevich’s expedition. Many places in Alaska still bear the names of those Russians.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Unfortunately for Wildcats and Sun Devils, neither school can claim bragging rights this year over which sits above the other in the most high-profile college rankings. Arizona State University and University of Arizona tied for 117th place in the 2020 list of Best National Universities from U.S. News & World Report, which compiles annual lists assessing universities across the country. But ASU did achieve one distinction: The school was again named the most innovative university in the country, for the fifth year running. U.S. News ranks colleges on a variety of factors, including student outcomes, faculty resources, expert opinions on the schools, financial resources, student excellence and alumni donations.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: The City Council is forming a committee to evaluate applications for a new casino, even though Pope County has already made its pick on an applicant. Arkansas voters in 2018 authorized four casinos in the state: two at racetracks in Hot Springs and West Memphis and two in Jefferson and Pope counties. The Jefferson County casino is already under construction, but the process in Pope County has been slowed by challenges. Last month, the Pope County Quorum Court endorsed a proposal from the Cherokee National Businesses, but leaders in Russellville say they want a say in the process. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the council voted Thursday to establish a seven-member committee to review proposals. The state Racing Commission has set a Nov. 18 deadline to receive casino license applications.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Thousands of tourists could soon be forced to make reservations and pay to drive the famously crooked Lombard Street. California lawmakers approved a bill last week granting San Francisco the power to establish a toll and reservation system for Lombard Street. The bill still needs Gov. Gavin Newsom’s signature. The San Francisco County Transportation Authority has recommended $5 per car on weekdays and $10 on weekends and holidays. Residents say the scenic street has become more like an overcrowded amusement park than a neighborhood street. They have been calling for years for officials to address traffic jams, trash and trespassing. Tourism officials estimate 6,000 people daily visit the 600-foot-long street in the summer, creating lines of cars stretching for blocks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A utility company is moving ahead with plans for a wind energy project on the eastern Colorado plains. Xcel Energy-Colorado plans to complete the 500-megawatt Cheyenne Ridge Wind Project in December 2020. The $743 million project will cover some 150 square miles in Cheyenne and Kit Carson counties. The Denver Post reports Xcel has selected Minneapolis-based development company Mortenson to build the wind farm. Mortenson previously built the 600-megawatt Rush Creek Wind Project in eastern Colorado. Denmark-based Vestas will supply 229 wind turbines for Cheyenne Ridge. Xcel Energy proposes to eliminate all of its carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Colorado officials seek to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by 90% of 2005 levels by 2050.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: Highway signs listing attractions in southeastern Connecticut have remained blank for about a year. The Day newspaper reports state plans show there are 17 large blue signs in both directions on Interstate 95 between North Stonington and New London, plus smaller signs on the exit ramps. The Connecticut Department of Transportation first held signage meetings in Stonington and Groton in 2016. Blank attractions signs were installed last year. The DOT says the designs for the panels were not ready before the signs were installed, and it had to approve custom logos. Residents asked the newspaper about the blank signs earlier this year. The firm hired by the state to install the signs, Quaker Corporation, says it hopes the panels listing the attractions will be up in the next month.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes Beach: Hurricane Dorian has come and gone, but some animals are still feeling its impact. Ferocious winds and crashing waves stirred by the hurricane swept a higher-than-average number of animals ashore along the Delaware coast, according to the Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute. “Whenever we get a large storm like that, the wave energy and the wind direction can push animals in that are either deceased or debilitated,” says Suzanne Thurman, executive director of MERR. Among the stranded animals were six loggerhead sea turtles, five of which were found dead. However, a female loggerhead weighing about 275 pounds was discovered alive at Lewes Beach. The animal had what was thought to be a pre-existing shell injury caused by a boat propeller, according to Thurman.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A black-owned funeral parlor was handling up to 140 funerals per year during its peak from the 1950s through the 1980s. The Washington Post reports the Hall Brothers Funeral Home only handled four funerals last year, the number driven low by clientele who either died or were driven out by gentrification. The parlor’s owner, 77-year-old Richard Ables, says of the neighborhood: “If we saw a white person, we’d ask, ‘What are you doing here?’ Now it’s the opposite.” Ables sold the property housing the dying business Wednesday, nearly 80 years after it was founded by his uncles. The newspaper notes the parlor was the last of its kind along its corridor, which is now home to an increasing number of young, white professionals.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiramar Beach: A bottle containing four $1 bills, a couple of notes and a man’s ashes is back on its journey, returning to the sea after making a brief stop at a coastal community in the Panhandle. The bottle carries the ashes of a 39-year-old Florida man who died earlier this year and whose family wanted to give him an adventure. The bottle began drifting off the shore of Destin before washing ashore 20 miles down the coast. It was turned in to the Walton County Sheriff’s Office. That’s when Sgt. Paula Pendleton got a hold of it and read the notes in the bottle, from the man’s mother and his daughter. Pendleton lost her husband last year and was touched. On Friday, a friend with a boat took the bottle far into the Gulf to let it continue its journey.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers are again exploring the idea of new legalized gambling to help fund the HOPE scholarship program. If gambling in the state is expanded, the type of activity allowed will greatly determine how much money can be raised. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that casino gambling brought in record numbers last year, but the thoroughbred horse racing industry is shrinking. Experts say sports betting’s impact would be minimal. State lawmakers are studying the potential for economic benefits with expanded gambling. Adding horse racing or casino gambling in the state would require Georgians to approve a constitutional amendment allowing the expansion.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Scientists say lava from the Kilauea volcanic eruption has triggered an algae bloom seen from outer space. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports satellite images of the Big Island eruption showed green water around where the lava was entering the ocean. Scientists from the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California say their research on the event was published in Thursday’s edition of the journal Science. They say they conducted water chemistry tests to record the biological response to lava flowing into the ocean within days of the 2018 eruption. The tests signaled large amounts of chlorophyll, the green pigment in algae and other plants responsible for converting light into energy. Scientists say the lava fueled microscopic life, formed land and was just as creative as destructive.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An elk named Elliott who befriended archery elk hunters at a campground has been captured by state officials who are looking for a permanent home for him. Idaho Department of Fish and Game spokesman Evin Oneale tells the Idaho Statesman that Elliott was captured last week. Officials say someone bottle-fed Elliott as a calf earlier this year near the central Idaho town of Sweet, and he became habituated to humans. Fish and Game captured and relocated Elliott to central Idaho hoping he would join an elk herd in the area, but he instead chose to be with people. Hunter Trevor Chadwick says Elliott greeted him and other elk hunters at their campsite. Chadwick says hunters didn’t want to shoot Elliott because he was tame, and it wouldn’t be ethical.\n\nIllinois\n\nMount Pulaski: The Mount Pulaski Courthouse State Historic Site will celebrate the city’s annual fall festival next weekend. The courthouse is one of two buildings still standing where Abraham Lincoln practiced law as a circuit-riding attorney before he became president. Many festival activities will be held near the courthouse square. The courthouse will be open from noon to 6 p.m. Friday and all day Saturday except during the festival parade, which begins at 4 p.m. The festival will feature vintage games, wheat weaving and spinning, a hand-quilting demonstration and a discussion on mid-19th century currency. Abraham Lincoln presenter Randy Duncan of Carlinville will appear Saturday. Duncan will deliver Lincoln’s 1858 “House Divided” speech at 11 a.m. Saturday at the courthouse. Electronic devices will be offered as raffle prizes.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: A new heritage trail has been dedicated that traces the history of African Americans in the city. The new African American Heritage Trail opened Wednesday. WEHT-TV reports the trail provides a walking tour past Lincoln School, Liberty Baptist Church and the area’s business district, with stops that include stories and landmarks. The trail was dedicated by the Evansville African American Museum and Evansville’s metropolitan development department. Museum founder Sondra Matthews says that “history is just not a part of our education process” but also something that should be available “at home, in the churches and in the community.” Brochures for the walking tour are available at the trailhead at the Evansville African American Museum.\n\nIowa\n\nWest Des Moines: To celebrate 50 years of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Iowa, CEO Renee Hardman, 58, is looking 25 years ahead. The program sealed a time capsule Sunday afternoon that will preserve mementos for the next 25 years at the group’s yearly Big Little Picnic at Legion Park in West Des Moines. Hardman joined the program as a mentor a couple of days after finishing her education at Drake University. She was a “big” to the same “little” from age 6 to her high school graduation. Now that “little” is in her 40s. “She’s the daughter I never had,” Hardman says. In the program’s 50 years, mentors have touched the lives of more than 20,000 Iowan youths. The capsule will preserve letters from Hardman and the current and past board presidents, Sunday’s paper and a picture of the current staff, among other documents.\n\nKansas\n\nOlathe: Panic broke out at a suburban Kansas City festival that celebrates pioneer history after festivalgoers falsely believed shots had been fired. The Kansas City Star reports it was unclear what led some attendees to begin running and taking cover Saturday night at the Johnson County Old Settlers event in Olathe. Police said Sunday that reports of gunfire weren’t substantiated. Amid the chaos, one woman fell and was hurt. Sixteen-year-old Mel Hipsher says she was with her friends getting tokens for games when she saw a group push through the crowd, running. The teen says she and her friends also started running. She says she heard someone yell about a shooter. Word was quickly spread on social media about a purported shooting at the event that includes music and rides.\n\nKentucky\n\nMadisonville: Transportation officials are offering a historic bridge for adoption. A statement from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet says it is trying to find an acceptable reuse for the Blackford Creek Bridge at the Hancock-Daviess County line, which is scheduled to be replaced next year. The span was built around 1919 and has been determined as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Engineer Deneatra Henderson says good uses for the 60-foot long steel Pratt pony truss bridge include adding it to a hiking and biking trail or as part of a golf course cart path. Those interested in adopting the bridge can submit letters of interest and proposals before Dec. 1. Officials say if no one adopts the span, it will be demolished.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Visitors can now see the baby orangutan born less than two months ago at the city’s zoo, but only when her mother decides to come outdoors. Bulan was born July 17 to longtime Audubon Zoo resident Feliz and to Jambi, a male Sumatran orangutan brought from Germany last fall. Zoo spokeswoman Lauren Messina Conrad says her name means “Moon” in Indonesia’s official language. Conrad says Bulan will spend many months clinging to Feliz – something she can do even when asleep. She says Jambi; Bulan’s 10-year-old half-sister, Menari; and another 10-year-old female named Reese have been bonding with Bulan behind the scenes, and all are getting along well. The shaggy, red-haired great apes are critically endangered. Hunting and habitat destruction have drastically cut numbers of Sumatran orangutans.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A new campaign aims to keep college students from leaving the state once they graduate. The Portland Press Herald reports the pilot program is launching this October through the University of Maine, Husson University in Bangor, Thomas College in Waterville and the University of Southern Maine. Student interns at each campus will hand out fliers, stickers and T-shirts to inform students about small and midsize employers in Maine. Interns will also coordinate events where students can meet employers. Industry-funded workforce development groups Live + Work in Maine and Educate Maine are behind the campaign, which also is partnering with a startup ride service to reach out to students. The groups hope to encourage more college students to stay after graduation in light of Maine’s escalating labor shortage.\n\nMaryland\n\nCumberland: The Highway Administration has removed several road signs for “Negro Mountain” over concerns about racial insensitivity in the name. Agency spokeswoman Lora Rakowski confirmed to news outlets Sunday that four signs along Interstate 68 and U.S. Alternate Route 40 were removed in April. Rakowski told the Cumberland Times-News the agency is working with the Association for the Study of African American Life and History and community members going forward. Historian Lynn Bowman told the newspaper the origin of the mountain’s name is unknown, but some accounts refer to it being named after a black man who died in a battle with Native Americans. Lynchings were also said to have taken place on the mountain. The mountain’s ridge runs 30 miles through the Allegheny range and peaks in Pennsylvania.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A bill aimed at giving cats and dogs that have been subjects in research institutions and product testing facilities a second shot at life is set to come up at a public hearing. The bill would require that research labs spare animals from automatic euthanasia and instead use animal rescue organizations to help get the dogs and cats adopted. The bill was approved by the Massachusetts Senate last session but failed to become law. It’s set for a public hearing Tuesday at the Statehouse. Animals that pose a risk to public health are exempted. Tens of thousands of cats and dogs are used for research and experimentation in the U.S. each year. Many of them are beagles. Activists say nine states have approved similar bills.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The CEO and founder of MeToo Kit, a company that is bringing to market a do-it-yourself sexual assault test kit, says she got death threats after Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel accused her company of trying to profit from the #MeToo movement. “We’ve had people saying, ‘I hope you get hit by a (expletive) bus,’ excuse my French,” Madison Campbell says. “If the attorney general wanted to hurt a pair of 23-year-old and 24-year-old women running a small company trying to help sexual assault survivors, she won.” Nessel’s office sent a cease-and-desist letter to MeToo Kit on Aug. 29, alleging the company is in violation of several sections of Michigan’s Consumer Protection Act by “luring victims into thinking that an at-home-do-it-yourself sexual assault kit will stand up in court,” Nessel said in a news release.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Fire officials say a blaze has gutted a historic synagogue. Firefighters responded to the conflagration at the Adas Israel Congregation in downtown Duluth about 2 a.m. Monday. All that is left among the charred remains are the remnants of some structural walls. Duluth Assistant Fire Chief Brent Consie says it “is pretty much a total loss.” Officials haven’t provided information on the cause of the blaze. Authorities say one firefighter who was struck by falling debris was taken to a hospital, treated and released. According to its website, the Adas Israel Congregation is an Orthodox/High Conservative Jewish congregation with a membership of 75 people. Construction of the synagogue was completed in 1902.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group advocating for medical marijuana legalization has turned in more than 105,000 signatures to get the initiative on the ballot next year. News outlets report Mississippians for Compassionate Care submitted the signatures Wednesday to the secretary of state’s office, which now must review and certify the signatures. The group and activist Ashley Durval registered the Medical Marijuana 2020 initiative last year. Durval’s daughter, Harper Grace, hasn’t been able to receive marijuana extract oil for treatment of her rare form of epilepsy. A 2014 law named for Harper Grace nixed the oil from the state’s banned substances list. The group is confident voters will support the measure. Others, including Gov. Phil Bryant, say there’s a lack of scientific evidence proving the benefits of marijuana treatment outweigh any risks.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The Department of Conservation is considering changing state regulations to help landowners combat damage from wildlife and feral hogs. The department said in a news release that the proposals would allow a conservation agent to authorize actions such as thermal imaging to take wildlife causing damage to private property. Landowners would have to obtain written authorization to use thermal imaging or night vision equipment for wildlife. Another change would allow a landowner’s representative to use thermal imagery or night vision equipment to eliminate feral hogs from the landowner’s property, with the permission of a conservation agent. The agency is seeking public comment through Oct. 31 and will make a final decision Dec. 13.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State officials propose to pay $3.4 million to ensure public access to a large area on the Yellowstone River. The proposed conservation easement purchase by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks would cover 15 square miles in Treasure County in southeastern Montana. State officials say that besides ensuring access, the easement would conserve habitat for big game, waterfowl, upland game birds and nongame wildlife. The DeCock Ranch Co. owns the land linking a wildlife management area, state lands and a U.S. Bureau of Land Management recreational area. The Billings Gazette reports federal funds would cover 75% of the purchase cost. Under the proposal, the ranch might require members of the public to request permission to access the property. Cattle grazing could continue.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Plans by Mutual of Omaha to replace its headquarters have been put on hold. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the insurance company recently decided to put a pin in the idea of a new home base and instead focus on other priorities. Spokesman Jim Nolan says those other priorities include bolstering technology to support Mutual’s growing insurance business. The news comes after a more than yearlong study of a possible $200 million-plus project to replace Mutual’s current headquarters in midtown Omaha. The plan had been to erect a new headquarters fairly close by.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An adult video and bookstore that operated the Las Vegas area’s lone peep show has closed, marking the end of an era. The Las Vegas Sun reports Showgirl Video shuttered last month, and the building it occupied will soon be torn down to make way for a marijuana dispensary. Showgirl Video was believed to be the last place in Las Vegas with a peep show – a place where dancers perform behind a window, which opened when a patron placed $1 into a machine, for tips. In 1992, the city passed an ordinance barring sexually oriented businesses along Las Vegas Boulevard, but Showgirl Video was grandfathered under old code and continued doing business.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Visitors are expected to spend more than $1.5 billion in the state this fall. The New Hampshire Division of Travel and Tourism Development projects more than 3 million out-of-state, overnight visitors will spend time in the Granite State this fall season. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-largest travel season, behind summer. The division’s fall marketing campaign highlights activities such as hiking, leaf peeping, agritourism, dining and shopping.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Volunteers went door-to-door over the weekend to help sign up thousands of residents to have their corroding lead service lines replaced. Volunteers began the effort Saturday, passing out free bottled water and beginning to register the estimated 18,000 homes at risk due to old supply lines. Mayor Ras Baraka said the city is “working aggressively” to solve the water issue by replacing all lead service lines. About 250 people previously attended a meeting at City Hall to get involved with registering residents. City, state and county officials earlier announced a plan to borrow $120 million to dramatically cut the time it will take to replace pipes causing the problem. City officials estimate more than 800 lines have been replaced so far.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state is pushing forward with a multimillion-dollar effort to encourage participation in the U.S. census to preserve federal funding for schools, health care and various public benefits. The state launched its “I Count New Mexico” website Friday that includes a video message from Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham encouraging residents to participate in the national population count next year. The state is offering $2.4 million in grant money to county governments that can encourage traditionally undercounted communities to participate in the first census with online access. The state website estimates New Mexico would lose about $3,750 in annual federal spending for each person that goes uncounted. The state estimates a 1% undercount would reduce annual federal Medicaid spending by $32 million and undercut health care services.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Sept. 11 memorial at ground zero has been evolving as the 18th anniversary of the attacks approaches. This year, when nearly 3,000 victims’ names are read aloud there Wednesday, a half-dozen stacks of stone will quietly salute an untold number of people who aren’t on that list. The granite slabs installed on the memorial plaza this spring recognize an initially unseen toll of the 2001 terror attacks: firefighters, police and others who died or fell ill after exposure to toxins unleashed in the wreckage. Caryn Pfeifer’s husband, firefighter Ray Pfeifer, died in 2017 of cancer that developed after he spent months searching the rubble for remains. She says the new 9/11 Memorial Glade gives families like hers a place to “think about everybody.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A Republican legislator says rewriting dozens of General Assembly districts that judges found to be illegal political gerrymanders will be “unprecedented” in state history because partisan data can’t be considered in redrawing them. The House and Senate held redistricting committee meetings Monday, nearly a week since a state court declared Republican mapmakers manipulated voting districts created in 2017 to help elect a maximum number of GOP candidates. The judges told legislators to enact new boundaries by Sept. 18. GOP Sen. Paul Newton of Cabarrus County says Democrats and Republicans have used partisanship in their map drawing for generations. The judges also told legislators that all mapmaking must be done in public meetings.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The leaders of four American Indian tribes have signed an agreement with the state that includes allowing tribes to license foster care parents on and off reservations. The Bismarck Tribune reports the tribes attended a ceremonial signing Friday at the state Capitol. The agreement involves funding that gives money to states and tribes for foster care, transitional independent living programs, and guardianship and adoption programs and services. Tribes can access the funding through an agreement with states. State foster care administrator Dean Sturn says until the new agreement, tribes could license foster care parents only on tribal lands. Sturn says Native American children represent more than 35% of children in North Dakota’s foster care system.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A permanent, 200-foot-high SkyStar observation wheel is coming to the city’s downtown next year. A release from Game Day Communications says the current 150-foot-high portable wheel is scheduled to be replaced in early 2020. The Hamilton County Commissioners unanimously voted for the permanent structure Thursday. SkyStar managing partner Todd Schneider says his team has been “overwhelmed with requests to stay part of Cincinnati’s skyline.” The new wheel is contracted to stand for 10 years. SkyStar will be able to renew the contract in five-year installations twice. The permanent wheel will be in the same location. The release says a portion of SkyStar’s revenue will be donated to the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center and ArtsWaves, a community arts fund.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials with the pension system for retired Oklahoma Highway Patrol troopers and other state law enforcement officers say the FBI is investigating after computer hackers stole $4.2 million in funds. A notice posted on the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System website Friday said no pension benefits of any members are at risk. Gov. Kevin Stitt’s spokeswoman Donelle Harder says the theft is believed to have resulted from a hack of the agency’s email system, but the investigation is ongoing. The OLERS email system is managed by the state Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The theft was first reported by The Oklahoman. The executive director of OLERS, Duane Michael, didn’t immediately respond to a request by the Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nOregon\n\nTrail: Workers at Cole Rivers Hatchery have put in new plastic water piping as a temporary fix to prevent another massive die-off of Rogue River spring chinook salmon eggs. The Mail Tribune reports the work is intended to prevent a repeat of a fungal outbreak in December that killed 1.2 million spring chinook eggs and young fish called fry. The work is a stop-gap effort until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers fixes the water system and worn-out elements at the 46-year-old facility. Officials say the die-off in December was caused by rusting metal pipes and bacteria in sediment that accumulated for years in the piping. The hatchery is intended to make up for the loss of wild spring chinook production due to the building of Lost Creek Dam.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: An art exhibit at a former prison-turned-museum is showcasing animated short films created by currently incarcerated inmates. “Hidden Lives Illuminated” showcases 20 short films and projects them on an outside wall, offering a glimpse into the lives of these inmates to passersby and museum visitors alike. Sean Kelley, the director of interpretation at Eastern State Penitentiary, got the idea for the project after seeing a similar exhibit in Chicago called “Freedom/Time” and secured a $297,000 grant from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage to bring it to fruition. Men at Chester State Correctional Institution and women at the Riverside Correctional Facility worked about nine months on the project, taking what amounted to two semesters of a college-level film production class. “Hidden Lives Illuminated” runs through Thursday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A law school is dedicating a classroom to the state’s first black female lawyer Tuesday. Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol says it will honor Dorothy Russell Crockett Bartleson, who was admitted to the bar in 1932 as the state’s seventh female lawyer. She was 21 years old at the time. The school says research indicates she was the only black woman admitted to the state bar until the 1970s. RWU Law Dean Michael Yelnosky says dedicating the classroom helps all Rhode Island lawyers learn more about the history of the profession in the state. Crockett Bartleson died in 1955. Her daughter, Dianne Bartleson of Surprise, Arizona, will cut the ribbon for the classroom. First Circuit Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson will deliver an address.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state prison system has added a psychological test to the drug screenings for new guards and other employees. Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the tests were implemented to try to weed out bad matches for employment that have increased the turnover rate to nearly 30% annually. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston the test asks applicants what they would do in certain scenarios. The answers can single out people who might be more tempted to bring in contraband or make a bad decision like mistreating an inmate while in a stressful situation. The new test has been in place for about five months, and officials say 12% of applicants have scored so low they aren’t considered for a job.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: State regulators say Rapid City Regional Airport did not cause contamination when it dumped sewage on its property last month. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources says tests of the airport’s septic lagoon found its contents would have been safe to spread on land had airport officials sought permission to do so. A department spokesman tells the Rapid City Journal regulators also determined there was “no evidence of runoff or impacts to surface water bodies” in places where wastewater was dumped. Those results were corroborated by a private firm that also conducted tests. The airport dumped about 74,000 gallons of sewage on its property without a permit. The airport’s executive director said the open-air lagoon was at risk of overflowing following weeks of heavy rainfall.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city’s first Catholic bishop no longer appears on a mural of Memphians who stood up for others. Instead, Bishop Carroll T. Dozier has been painted over, replaced by Jose Guerrero, a founder of Latino Memphis. Facing History and Ourselves made the change Saturday after the publication of a Commercial Appeal article highlighting the fact that Dozier had appeared on a list of clergy “credibly accused” of the sexual abuse of a child. “We wish to extend our sincerest wishes of comfort, healing and strength to the victims and families touched by the scourge of clergy sex abuse,” Facing History and Ourselves said in a statement. The mural, intended to honor people who helped others, is on a wall across from the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nTexas\n\nPort Isabel: The operations of the Port Isabel Lighthouse officially changed hands this month, with the Texas Historical Commission now taking the reins from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Department. The Brownsville Herald reports the iconic lighthouse, which is the only one along the Texas coast open to the public, was built on the grounds of Fort Polk in 1852 and decommissioned in 1905. It’s part of Port Isabel’s branding. The lighthouse is where the city holds its summer movie series and market days and will continue to do so under the agreement with THC, City Manager Jared Hockema says. The city bought the land on which the lighthouse sits and donated it to the state. The city will continue to operate the lighthouse.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: A man who has battled alcoholism and homelessness is now a local celebrity, regularly performing music on the streets of downtown Orem. The Daily Herald reports 35-year-old Scott Schwarz is often found riding his bike and playing the drums on a single construction bucket. Schwarz says he picked up the hobby about two years ago while transitioning out of rehab. He said he hit rock-bottom about a decade ago after losing his house and breaking up with his girlfriend. After trying to take his own life, Schwarz checked himself into a rehab facility. The street performer calls his drumming hobby therapeutic and says it brings people joy. “One of the beautiful things about it is it taught me to be OK with failing in public with great regularity,” Schwarz says.\n\nVermont\n\nHinesburg: State and local officials plan to host a tour of the town forest. The Hinesburg Town Forest Committee and the Chittenden County forester will lead a public walk on the LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest. The purpose of the Sept. 28 event is to seek input on an upcoming management plan for the forest and to raise awareness of current restoration and management efforts. The 301-acre conserved municipal forest has been owned by the town of Hinesburg since 2007. A major focus of a new 10-year plan is expected to be the control of invasive exotic plants and the restoration of flood plain and wetland natural communities. The goal is to improve wildlife habitat, water quality and ecosystem health.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The governor embroiled in a blackface scandal earlier this year is appointing a new top aide whose job will be to make government more inclusive. Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday that he’s appointing Janice Underwood to a newly created senior position whose duties will include formulating a strategic plan to “address systemic inequities” in state government. Underwood is the former director of diversity initiatives at Old Dominion University. Northam faced intense pressure to resign after it became public knowledge that a photo of someone wearing blackface appears on his 1984 medical school yearbook page. The governor denied being in the picture but admitted to wearing blackface as a young man while portraying Michael Jackson at a dance party in the 1980s.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A federal judge has blocked the government from imposing a 50% wage hike for blueberry pickers. The Olympian reports U.S. District Court Judge Salvador Mendoza Jr. temporarily stopped the Department of Labor from implementing a July order raising wages for pickers. Zirkle Fruit southeast of Seattle sued to prevent the government from starting the new wage structure. The government notified Zirkle of the new pay rate July 24, a day after the increase actually took effect. Zirkle said it was blindsided by the mid-harvest pay hike. The blueberry harvest began in June and continues through September. The injunction will remain in effect until it is lifted or the case is resolved at trial. In the interim, Zirkle is required to deposit the difference between the old and new wages, as well as taxes, into a trust account.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Organizers of the State Fair of West Virginia say attendees spent record amounts of money on food and carnival rides this year. WCHS-TV reports that state fair organizers said $2.5 million was spent on food, and more than $1.1 million went to carnival ride gross sales this year. Kelly Collins, chief executive officer of the fair, said in a news release that overall attendance was more than 160,000 at the 95th annual fair, which was held Aug. 8 to Aug. 17 in Greenbrier County. Collins said attendance at the fair was about average.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHolcombe: Students at a rural school district are getting access to mental health services with a new video-conferencing system to address a shortage of options nearby. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the closest mental health clinic available to students at the Lake Holcombe School District is about a 20-minute drive away. The district is about 40 miles northeast of Eau Claire. Prevea Health counselors will be connecting with students by video. Prevea clinic manager Nicole Califf says getting mental health services has been challenging for students who don’t have a means of transportation. Officials hope to have the program available in October. Students who seek treatment will enter a private room where they’ll connect with a therapist on a television screen.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A proposal to boost state revenue by storing spent nuclear fuel in the state would only raise about $10 million a year. The Casper Star-Tribune reports a panel of state lawmakers heard about the proposal last week and will consider whether that amount is worth the political battle to make it a reality. The discussion of the Spent Fuel Rods Subcommittee focused largely on potential environmental and health risks of having a nuclear waste storage facility in the state. Committee chairman Jim Anderson, a Republican senator from Casper, says if the revenue isn’t there, there won’t be any interest in the plan. The idea was introduced in July as a way to boost state revenue with the coal industry waning. A similar plan was vetoed by then-Gov. Mike Sullivan in the early 1990s.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/06/15/silver-dollar-city-thunder-silenced-empty-vegas-buffets-news-around-states/111962742/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state prison system said that a third inmate has died after testing positive for COVID-19 as the number of cases among inmates and staff continued to rise. Clarence Shepherd, an 80-year-old inmate at St. Clair Correctional Facility, died Friday after testing positive for the new coronavirus, the Alabam Department of Corrections reported. The prison system said a total of 119 staff and contract workers and 28 inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 .Twenty-nine of those staff members have returned to work. Inmate advocates and health experts have expressed concerns that the state’s overcrowded prisons would become a breeding ground for a deadly outbreak and urged the state to make additional changes. The prison system has said it is taking precautions such as distributing masks to inmates and quarantining infirmaries and other areas where there have been positive cases. The St. Clair’s infirmary, where Shepherd was housed, is quarantined, the prison system said. The Alabama Department of Corrections wrote in a news release that the department extends its sympathies to the Shepherd family and his loved ones during this difficult time.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Permanent Fund dividend was completed at $992 for each resident and distribution is expected to begin early this year because of economic impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, state department officials said. The state Department of Revenue said payments are expected to begin July 1 instead of in October. Residents who receive their payments by direct deposit and have been cleared for the check by June 19 are expected to receive the first disbursement in July, department officials said. The Department of Revenue estimated about 90% of all applicants will receive their check by July 1. Paper checks will be mailed starting July 1 to residents without direct deposit, officials said. The state budget passed earlier this year called for about $680 million in spending, which amounted to just under $1,000 for each recipient after people applied. This is the smallest Alaska Permanent Fund dividend payout since 2013, when a $900 check was distributed, KTUU-TV reported. Legislators or the governor have set the dividend amount during the annual budget-making process since 2016. A 2017 decision by the state Supreme Court said a traditional dividend-payment formula that was used from 1982 through 2015 remains on file but is not binding, the Anchorage Daily New reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: In one of the nation’s COVID-19 hot spots, Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring residents to wear masks in public, and it seems a good many people agree with him. In shopping malls, restaurants and the crowded bar scenes of Scottsdale and Tempe, most patrons have disdained the use of cloth face masks that health officials advocate to help slow the spread of virus. Robert Fowler, a truck driver in Phoenix, wears a mask as required for work but otherwise he goes about mask-free. “I’m not worried about it,” Fowler said while waiting for a table Thursday at Snooze A.M. Eatery, where the patio was full and only employees were seen donning face masks. Despite COVID-19 case numbers trending upward, Fowler has no plans to change. “Everybody’s going to get COVID one way or the other eventually,” he said. “People are gonna do what they want to do regardless.” In a red state with a Republican governor, the trend seems to be to follow President Donald Trump’s lead. Get the state reopened and keep the face masks in your pocket – that’s where Ducey kept his Thursday during a news conference in which he dismissed concerns that the dramatic increase in virus cases might overwhelm hospitals. The governor did say he recommended wearing masks when social distancing is impossible, but he has rarely been seen wearing one himself. Ducey wore one when he met last month with Trump, who wasn’t wearing one, at a Honeywell plant ramping up mask production.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: There are 548 new coronavirus cases in Arkansas and one additional deaths because of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, the Arkansas State Department of Health reported Saturday. There have been at least 12,095 confirmed cases and 177 deaths in the state, up from 1 1,547 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted the virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 7,863 residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some Californians will again be able to get a manicure, a new tattoo or enjoy a massage starting late this week under new state guidance issued Friday. But studios and salons won’t look the same when they do open. Workers and customers must wear face masks, adopt far more intense cleaning practices for shared reusable items like tweezers, and the services will be limited – no mouth or nose tattoos or piercings for now. The guidance on nail salons has been highly anticipated. The Professional Beauty Federation of California sued the state in May to reopen hair and nail salons. Hair salons were cleared to reopen several weeks ago. Gov. Gavin Newsom also sparked anger among some in the industry, including Vietnamese salon owners who own a majority of California’s salons, when he alleged California’s first case of the virus spreading in the community was linked to a nail salon. He declined to give details, citing privacy. The services can reopen starting June 19 in counties where health officials allow it. They join a long list of other businesses cleared to reopen in recent weeks, including hair salons, restaurants, churches and movie theaters. Most counties have been cleared to move forward, though infection rates and hospitalizations are climbing in some. The state is monitoring infection rates and hospitalizations in 11 counties. Beyond masks, nail salon workers should consider wearing face shields or goggles to protect their eyes and wear a new pair of disposable gloves for each customer. Salons should even consider putting plastic partitions with cutouts for hands between workers and customers. Salons should also no longer display nail polish bottles on a shelf and instead ask customers to choose a color from a palette that can be disinfected. Technicians should throw away nail files, buffers and other items after each use. Fred Jones, public policy director and legal counsel for the beauty federation, said he was pleased Newsom cleared the reopening but disappointed it took so long. He said he’s concerned some counties will delay.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Colorado Tourism Office has launched a campaign urging people to practice safety measures and follow health guidelines when visiting the state during the coronavirus pandemic. Visitors are urged to keep their distance from each other and wear masks, in addition to normal guidelines asking people to stick to trails, respect wildlife and pick up after pets, The Denver Post reported. “We want to continue to make sure that the health and safety of both residents and visitors are the highest priority,” office spokeswoman Abby Leeper said. The office is working with the state health department on protocols and guidelines for businesses, communities and visitors to include in its “Care for Coloradans” campaign, Leeper said. The campaign also includes a new brochure and animated videos advising people how to dress for the weather and different altitudes and other helpful recommendations. The state previously discouraged any travelers from visiting the mountains because of concerns that smaller communities would not be able to respond to any outbreaks. “After the great sacrifices that have been made to protect our state, it’s vitally important to set clear expectations so we can maintain all the gains that have been made and stay on course to reopen Colorado’s tourism economy,” Director Cathy Ritter said. Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order June 1 on the transition from the statewide stay-at-home order to safer at home “or in the great outdoors.” The office welcomed the order as more people are now expected to spend more time outside.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is allowing nursing homes to begin allowing some residents to meet with loved ones outside, wearing a mask and adhering to social distancing, months after Gov. Ned Lamont imposed a ban on most visits to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been particularly hard hit during the pandemic because older people are among the most vulnerable to the virus – but limiting visits was hard on residents and families. “We know that the social and emotional connection is incredibly important,” said Connecticut Long Term Care Ombudsman Mairead Painter, during a Facebook chat with families this week. Although many of the more than 200 nursing homes across the state have begun to allow these limited visitations, still strict restrictions are in place, said Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities and the Connecticut Center for Assisted Living. For example, families under most situations are not allowed inside the buildings. “It’s limited but it is an important step toward opening up visitation,” said Barrett, who said it’s still “much too early to say” when the more severe restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach:Fourth of July fireworks are a go in Dewey Beach this summer, the only beach town that didn’t cancel or postpone festivities because of the coronavirus pandemic. Alex Pires, leader of the Highway One Group that owns local businesses like The Rusty Rudder and the Bottle & Cork, posted on Facebook Thursday night that fireworks were on after receiving a permit from the Delaware State Fire Marshal’s office. The permit shows that the 2020 fireworks will be held on July 4 on a barge out on the Rehoboth Bay near downtown Dewey. Pires said in an emailed statement that this is the fifth year his company has held free fireworks in the town and that organizers will work closely with police, state and local agencies and elected officials “to make sure folks maintain proper social distances.” Mayor Dale Cooke said the town has no role to play in approving the fireworks display because they’re set off from a barge on the bay, which is outside of town limits. It’s also run by Highway One, not the town itself. Fireworks displays, parades, concerts and other community events stretching into July have been canceled throughout much of Delaware in response to the pandemic, including being canceled in Dover, Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach. Lewes postponed its festivities until the fall.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:As protesters continue to crowd the streets of the District, a nonprofit set up free testing sites, so people can check to see if they have the new coronavirus, WUSA-TV reported. The nonprofit CORE, or Community Organized Relief Effort, set up the sites Friday and Saturday, after feeling inspired by the protests across the country. CORE brought the testing to the District for the first time last weekend, but plans to hold more next weekend and hopefully moving forward. “Protesting is our civic duty, and we feel that testing ourselves is as well,” Ann Lee, CORE’s CEO said. “We want to support our awesome amazing protesters out there really saving our republic, and we feel that this is our best way to do that.” Lee originally co-founded the organization with actor Sean Penn to “empower and support vulnerable communities, who have suffered from inequality, exclusion from opportunities, and institutionalized violence.” Now, they’re working to keep those communities healthy amid the pandemic. “Predominantly it’s low-income communities of color that are always the most vulnerable … so we see that there is a much bigger, much longer standing disaster that has been happening, which is racism,” Lee said. “Keeping protesters safe is for us keeping these communities safe that always get hit the hardest in all these disasters.”\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples:More than 80% of the people who live or work in Florida’s nursing homes and assisted living facilities have been tested for COVID-19 as the state approaches its goal of getting all of them tested. As of June 10, the Department of Health had coordinated on-site testing for 133,615 residents and staff of the state’s long-term care facilities. The department has shipped another 126,690 testing kits directly to facilities that indicated they could do the testing on their own. Combined, that means 81% of the 320,771 people who live or work in a long-term care facility have been tested, according to Department of Health data. According to the health department, 3,300 long-term care facilities have been tested, either by on-site strike teams or they were mailed kits. There are about 3,800 nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the state, according to Florida Agency for Health Care Administration records. The department has been shipping out about 4,000 test kits per day, excluding Sundays and holidays. Facility leaders said they can compel staff members to be tested, but residents can opt out if they choose. Long-term care providers serve the state’s most vulnerable population. About 85% of Florida’s COVID-19 deaths have been among those 65 and older, and nearly half have been connected with long-term care facilities.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: The Park Springs elder care facility just outside of Atlanta took the unusual approach of having roughly 70 employees shelter in place on campus to protect its residents from the new coronavirus. It lifted that restriction over the weekend, and employees headed home for the first time since March 30. Nursing homes – among the hardest-hit places by the pandemic –– have limited visitors and screened people for the virus. Park Springs’ administrators said they feared those strategies might not be enough to keep their more than 500 residents safe. But the staff lockdown was not a measure they could sustain forever, said Donna Moore, chief operating officer of the company that owns Park Springs. The return home Saturday was bittersweet for staff, who gathered at a lunch before their departures to share their experience. Some cried and hugged each other. The company gave each of them a plaque inscribed with their names and a record of their sacrifice: “COVID-19 Shelter-In-Place 2020.” “Sometimes I said, ‘I can’t do this,’ ” O’Neil Marriott, a maintenance technician, said. But he said the rest of the staff gave him support to stay. “I appreciate everyone in here because you really made me feel like family,” he said. The staff walked out to meet loved ones to music and applause from Park Springs’ administrators. Some had carts loaded with shopping bags of supplies they had brought to sustain them during the lockdown. Park Springs’ lockdown started after four employees and a resident tested positive for the virus. They all recovered. Since the lockdown, the facility has seen two additional cases – both residents. One of those residents – a 96-year-old dementia patient – was visited by her daughter and a caregiver after doctors said she had little time left to live and then tested positive. She later died. The other tested positive after requiring medical care off campus and recovered from the virus.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: International college students who were unable to return home at the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic remain in Hawaii with limited means to work and get food. Many foreign students were stranded in the state by health restrictions established to stop the spread of COVID-19 that shut down international travel and embassies, Hawaii Public Radio reported. Ann Hartman, dean of education at the East-West Center in Honolulu, said about 180 of the international educational organization’s students have remained, some living in the organization’s dormitories. Although the dorms provide shelter, other opportunities are sparse. “As international students, we are only allowed to work on campus, like coffee shops, or as graduate assistants, or bookstores and things like that,” said Uyanga Batzogs, a graduate fellow from Mongolia at the center located near the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Students are allowed to work 20 hours per week during the normal school year, and up to 40 hours during breaks in the academic schedule, Batzogs said. The pandemic caused the University of Hawaii system to stop lectures and restrict services. “With our campus closed, now, as international students, we can’t find the jobs or try to work full-time during summer break at all,” Batzogs said. Seru Tagivakatini from Fiji said students like him rely on a $600 a month stipend from the East-West Center for expenses and face challenges obtaining adequate food.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: About 80,000 Idaho residents through early June have signed up for Medicaid under the state’s voter-approved expanded coverage, state officials said. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said that the overall number of people signing up for Medicaid has also picked up as the economy has struggled with the coronavirus pandemic. About 345,000 residents, including those who signed up through the expansion, are now covered by Medicaid. That compares to about 286,000 of Idaho’s 1.75 million residents who were covered by Medicaid in early September. Voters authorized Medicaid expansion in 2018 with an initiative that passed with 61% of the vote after years of inaction by state lawmakers.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A network of military and veteran organizations is offering free wellness checks for veterans, service members and their families during the coronavirus pandemic. Illinois Joining Forces is a partnership between state and private groups, including the Illinois Department of Veterans’ Affairs, that helps service members and veterans navigate service providers through its Care Coordination Center. The center typically responds to requests for assistance on issues such as housing, employment or health care. Now people can request the center conduct wellness checks, either on an ongoing basis or a single check-in, for veterans, members of the military or their families. Brigadier General Ret. Stephen Curda, executive director of Illinois Joining Forces, said the pandemic has forced hundreds of thousands of people in Illinois to search for the help they need and navigate overwhelming options. “It is imperative that we meet them halfway – and in our view, it starts with a simple phone call,” Curda said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana entered Stage 4 of Gov. Eric Holcomb’s reopening plan Friday, allowing additional businesses to reopen and fill at higher capacities. But as the coronavirus pandemic carries on, Indiana State Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box still has reservations. “Just because you’re not positive today, doesn’t mean you won’t be tomorrow,” Box said. Stage 4 of the reopening plan means restaurants can open to 75% capacity. Bars, movie theaters, bowling alleys and other entertainment venues can welcome customers back at 50% capacity. Zoos, museums and similar sites can reopen, and gatherings of up to 250 people are allowed as long as attendees stay 6 feet apart. Unlike other parts of the state, Marion County won’t enter its next reopening stage until June 19, however, bcause of higher case numbers of the virus. Beginning Monday, OptumServe testing sites will also be open to anyone who lives in Indiana, Box said, regardless of whether they are high-risk or symptomatic.\n\nIowa\n\nJefferson: The Iowa Department of Transportation has temporarily closed two maintenance garages after an employee tested positive for the new coronavirus and had contact with two dozen colleagues, a spokeswoman said. The garages in Jefferson and Boone were closed Wednesday after all 24 employees who work at them were ordered to self-isolate for 14 days, DOT spokeswoman Andrea Henry said. Crews in both garages were working together on projects and had exposure to the infected employee, she said. Their work will be picked up by other crews in the area during the closures, she said. Henry said the agency sends employees home immediately once they test positive, and conducts contact tracing to identify anyone with whom they had contact. DOT then requires exposed employees to self-isolate for 14 days, and cleans and disinfects their workplaces. Henry said employees are placed on paid leave during their mandatory isolation periods if their job duties do not allow them to work from home. Henry said the Altoona garage was closed in May after a positive case there required 11 employees to be isolated. She said those employees have since returned to work.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A protester who attended a demonstration over the death of George Floyd in downtown Topeka last week has tested positive for the new coronavirus, health officials said. According to a news release from the Shawnee County Health Department, the person attended June 1 protests at the city’s Law Enforcement Center, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. The department encourages anyone who attended protests that day to monitor themselves for COVID-19 symptoms. Meanwhile, the City-Cowley County Health Department on Friday said a 14 year old who tested positive for COVID-19 likely exposed people in Sedgwick and Cowley counties. The health department said the girl went to a sleepover and a public pool in Arkansas City before her test results came back positive June 10. The City-Cowley County Health Department ordered anyone who believes they might have been exposed to self-isolate for the next two days. The health department is offering free drive-through testing 1 p.m. to 4 p.m Monday at the Winfield Health Department office.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:The Kentucky Derby Festival has canceled this year’s Pegasus Parade and fireworks display known as Thunder Over Louisville, saying it would not be responsible to let the events go on in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The festival’s events were originally postponed until August and September leading up to the Sept. 5 Kentucky Derby in Louisville. Other events canceled for 2020 include the miniMarathon, the festival said Thursday. “As an organization that always puts public health and safety first, we know it would not be responsible for the Kentucky Derby Festival to put on events that attract crowds with not just hundreds, but hundreds of thousands of people,” said Matt Gibson, Kentucky Derby Festival president and CEO. This is the festival’s 65th year and the first time its traditional events have not been held in the spring.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Coronavirus pandemic closings have cost Louisiana casinos hundreds of millions of dollars, and one chain has told the state it might lay off as many as 1,500 workers. Monthly revenue reports showed that casinos lost about $347 million during March and April, with another $90 million or more lost by video gaming establishments, The Advertiser reported. And, though Las Vegas-based Boyd Gaming Corp. hasn’t set actual totals, it has sent more than 1,500 employees at its five Louisiana casinos letters advising them that they might be laid off, spokesman David Strow said. The company’s notification to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board said layoffs are expected during the first two weeks in July, the newspaper reported. They include up to 414 workers at Sam’s Town Hotel and Casino in Shreveport, 354 at Delta Downs Racetrack in Vinton, 340 at Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, 246 at Evangeline Downs Racetrack in Opelousas and 170 at Amelia Belle Casino in Amelia. Strow said in an email that he did not know current employee totals.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The first Mainer to receive transfusions of antibody-rich blood plasma said he remembers dreams of two groups chanting while he was on a ventilator for 18 days. Richard Stevenson said one group was chanting, “Let him die, let him die, let him die!” while the other chanted “Go Rich, go Rich, go Rich!” Stevenson, of Vinalhaven, told the Bangor Daily News that he credits his survival to the plasma transfusions at Mid Coast Hospital. He was the first person in Maine to get the experimental therapy. Stevenson said he believes he was exposed in December on an airplane long before the virus became widely known in the U.S. He never knew for sure whether he had COVID-19 then. But his symptoms returned, and he tested positive in March. He was weaned from the ventilator little more than a week after receiving plasma donated by COVID-19 survivors. “I’m the luckiest person on earth, is how I feel,” he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:Red White and Boom, the city’s annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration, has been canceled for this year. The decision announced on a Facebook post was made because it would be difficult to maintain social distancing during the event to ensure guests’ health and safety amid the coronavirus pandemic. “We want to give our sincere thanks to everyone who has worked so hard to make the event happen and let you know how much we appreciate your time and effort. Fantastic Fireworks, our Sponsors, and our partners at the City and County level have assisted us up until the last minute to try to make the event happen,” the statement said. Although this year’s event is a no-go, organizers said they plan to be back in 2021 and “bigger and better than ever.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmherst: The University of Massachusetts won’t be holding its usual presentations at the Amherst campus’ Sunwheel for the summer solstice this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, but the public is still invited to visit the site at sunrise and sunset this week. Visitors should wear face coverings, employ social distancing and be prepared for the possibility of wet footing and mosquitoes, according to a statement from the university. At the solstice, the sun’s rising and setting positions barely change for more than a week, according to UMass Amherst astronomer Stephen Schneider. “From June 15 to 25, the shift of the sun will be less than one-fifth its own size. That’s barely detectable without astronomical instruments, so any of those days would be great to visit the Sunwheel to see the alignment of the standing stones with the rising or setting position of the sun,” he said. The astronomical start of summer is at 5:43 p.m. on June 20, the moment when the sun reaches its farthest northerly position in the sky, making that the longest day of the year. The UMass Amherst Sunwheel is located just south of the football stadium.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Eastern Michigan University is guaranteeing a single room on campus starting this fall for any enrolled student who wants one. The school announced its “EMU Single Room Guarantee” in response to physical distancing and other safety concerns because of the coronavirus pandemic. It’s for students living in campus residence halls who don’t want a roommate. Students who wish to have a roommate will continue to have that option. Single rooms typically cost approximately $2,500 a year more than a shared, double room, Eastern Michigan said. Under the new plan, the university is offering a credit to reduce the annual cost of a single room to $100 per month more than the cost of sharing a room. The credit provides an annual savings of $1,700 over the typical single room rate. “We have heard from many students and parents about this issue,” Eastern Michigan President James Smith said. “They question how students can practice safe physical distancing when they have a roommate in close proximity to them in a residence hall room. We understand a single room may not be for everyone, but we also know and have heard from many who desire such accommodations at this time.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The University of Minnesota’s Board of Regents on Friday approved a $4 billion operating budget for the coming fiscal year as well as a plan to help offset losses because of the coronavirus pandemic. The budget outline includes freezes on tuition, system-wide hiring and merit pay raises for all employees. Separately, regents approved an initiative for temporary employee pay cuts and furloughs to help make up for $35 million in room and board refunds after students were sent home for the spring semester. The fiscal year 2021 budget beginning July 1 assumes a return to “near normalcy” with the reopening of campus classrooms and facilities in the fall, the Star Tribune reported. University leaders have developed two contingency plans in case the pandemic worsens and the return of students is pushed deeper into the fall. The budget “provides a responsible, by no means definite, base level of operations from which potential contingency plans can be shaped,” President Joan Gabel said during a regents committee meeting. Gabel’s COVID-19 budget includes a 10% pay cut for Gabel and her cabinet.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:The Mississippi Department of Education is offering options for how schools can offer classes starting in the fall semester, with consideration for social distancing and other safety guidelines because of the coronavirus pandemic. The department has released a plan giving school districts three options: a traditional schedule, a hybrid schedule and a virtual schedule. The plan “outlines a three-month timeline of strategies for superintendents and principals to consider to plan for the start of the 2020-21 school year” and is “intended to be used as a resource and starting point for districts to consider local needs in collaboration with stakeholders,” department spokeswoman Jean Cook told the Clarion Ledger. It will be updated in to adjust to changes with the COVID-19 pandemic, she said. Jason Harris, Columbia School District superintendent, is one of nine superintendents who worked with the state to create the plans. “This isn’t a ‘You must follow,’ ” Harris said. “This is just guidance that people can use as a reference when determining what is best for their district.” Harris said although his school district intends to have the traditional schedule, he knows some parents might not feel safe sending children to school. That’s when the hybrid schedule or virtual schedule could be used. So, for the upcoming school year, students who study from home would have the option of watching their teacher’s lesson from a classroom webcam. The lesson would be recorded and uploaded, giving the student the option to watch it later.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson:The Silver Dollar City theme park opened its gates Saturday for the first time in 2020 after opening day was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 6,000 season pass holders made reservations to attend the park Saturday. A typical Saturday during the summer draws about 15,000. Season pass holders were the first allowed in the park on Saturday and Sunday; the park opened to the general public Monday for those who make reservations. About 8,000 to 10,000 are expected when the park opens for everyone. Those who enter have to wear a mask throughout the park except on water rides and while eating. Visitors are screened with COVID-19-related questions and temperatures are taken before they enter the park. Signs throughout encourage social distancing while reminding folks to keep their masks on. The park’s performers stay in character while wearing masks. Instead of buffet lines, food is delivered to the table. About every other table is closed in eating areas to keep visitors distanced from others. Carts on the rides are frequently stopped and sanitized. Indoor shows are closed, but there’s still music to be heard from the outdoor performances around every other corner. Saturday saw the opening of a new area called Rivertown that features Mystic River Falls –– a new water ride that has the tallest drop in the Western Hemisphere. The ride is still expected to open this summer.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock announced $8.7 million in federal funding for education interests.The funding comes from a U.S. Department of Education fund that gives governors the authority to distribute money to local education entities. This funding is separate from the state’s $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund. Bullock urged residents to continue following public health guidelines to avoid the spread of the virus. He said he doesn’t expect the state will meet the guidelines to fully reopen anytime soon, especially because other states are seeing rising case numbers and hospitalizations.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The past 12 weeks at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium have been perplexing for Dennis Pate, zoo director and CEO. On June 1, though, some semblance of normalcy returned when the zoo opened its gates with many changes and some cooperative weather. A few thousand visitors have strolled around the zoo each day since. The zoo has been open for nearly a week and looks much different amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a typical year, the zoo is open 364 – it’s closed only on Christmas Day. “It’s a step in the direction of normalcy,” Walter Jones, a zoo member who had three grandchildren with him Sunday, said of the reopening. And to be sure, the zoo is not back to normal yet. All indoor exhibits are closed, and visitors are funneled on a one-way walk around the zoo. More exhibits could open in the next two to three weeks, Pate said, depending on what visitor feedback is received and further evaluations of how the zoo can keep visitors safe. Along the one-way path are 50 hand-sanitizing stations, painted paw prints that visualize social distancing recommendations and concession stands with plastic shields between employees and visitors. Adhering to the state’s directed health measure, the zoo allows no more than 3,000 people in at a time. This week, zoo director and CEO Dennis Pate said, the zoo has seen from 1,500 people per day earlier in the week to just more than 3,000 people on Saturday. Pate described the zoo’s financial situation as “struggling mightily.” As a nonprofit, 91% of the zoo’s income comes from admissions, memberships and other sales.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The famous Las Vegas buffet has become a victim of the coronavirus pandemic, which shut down casinos statewide for nearly three months. Although casinos began to reopen June 4, the state has not yet given the green light for self-serve restaurants. With the highly contagious virus still circulating – it is usually transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets – the communal dining concept is facing serious challenges. At Red Rock Resort, a Station Casinos property, several restaurants reopened ahead of the rest of the property, but there was no timeline for reopening the popular Feast Buffet. Station Casinos is opening its properties in phases. Earlier this month, San Diego-based Garden Fresh Restaurants, owner of Souplantation and Sweet Tomatoes with several Las Vegas-area buffet restaurants, announced the closure of all 97 locations nationwide. Golden Corral, with locations in Las Vegas and Henderson, reopened earlier this month by serving customers cafeteria-style. But Donald Contursi, founder of Lip Smacking Foodie Tours, said it would be a mistake to assume the Las Vegas buffet is gone forever. “Health and safety is at the forefront now, but I believe that, if Las Vegas has been reinventing itself over and over all these years, it will find a way to reinvent the buffet to ensure its guests are safe,” Contursi said. Larry Rogers, manager of the Southern Nevada Health District’s food operations division, said a shift to cafeteria-style service or having a server take buffet orders at the table will likely become common for the foreseeable future.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A racetrack that violated state orders during the coronavirus pandemic will be allowed to reopen this weekend ahead of other similar businesses. Riverside Speedway in Groveton held races in late May despite being warned by police that doing so would violate the state’s order prohibiting large gatherings. After being told the state was planning legal action, the owner postponed the rest of the season and then sued Gov. Chris Sununu over the restrictions. A judge held a hearing on the speedway’s request for an emergency order blocking the restrictions Friday, a day after Sununu announced that racetracks would be allowed to reopen Monday. While the case proceeds, attorneys for both sides agreed that Riverside could hold races this weekend if it follows rules regarding limited capacity, social distancing and cleaning. Joe Bassett, general manager at Lee USA Speedway in Lee, said he doesn’t think it’s fair that Riverside is getting special treatment after violating the order. “But he’s between a rock and a hard place, as all short tracks are,” he said. “We have limited time in summer to make our money, yet we have bills 12 months of the year.” Bassett said his track will likely reopen June 19, though it will be a scramble. He asked fans to be patient. “I’ve got three weeks’ worth of planning to make it work in a week,” he said. “But we’ll get things rolling.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The city backed off on its plans to offer indoor dining beginning Monday, in defiance of a state order. The City Council had authorized restaurants last week to offer indoor dining with restrictions beginning Monday, violating Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s executive order. After the state sued on Friday and a judge issued an order temporarily blocking the town’s attempt, Mayor John Moor and the council released a statement Friday night recommending that restaurants not serve diners indoors. “We are advising Asbury Park businesses not to open indoors as we had announced earlier this week, as opening indoors would violate the court order and could jeopardize your business’s liquor licenses” and subject businesses to fines and other penalties, the statement said. As part of the second phase of the state’s efforts to reopen its economy, Murphy has authorized outdoor dining and nonessential retail to resume Monday but hasn’t authorized indoor dining. Murphy said Friday he would crack down on businesses that weren’t in compliance. Asbury Park’s resolution would have permitted restaurants to host diners inside at 25% of the building’s capacity or 50 people, whichever is fewer. Murphy has not indicated when restaurants will be able to reopen for indoor seating, aside from saying he hoped it would be “sooner rather than later.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Albuquerque Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, has asked parents for feedback after announcing plans to provide an online school experience for all grades because of the coronavirus pandemic. “Families have definitely indicated that there is a desire for some families to keep their children home,” said Deborah Elder, the district’s innovation executive director. “We just don’t know how big that desire is.” The district expects to launch an online system to collect input through a form or survey on the all-online school experience idea, officials said. It is unclear when that system would launch. Submitted comments could help the district gauge how many children are expected to take part and how many teachers would need to prepare, Elder said. An online-only education is a new concept for the district, officials said, adding that it would likely rely on parents, especially for younger-aged students, but they recognize not every family would be able to do that. The district is considering other options as well to begin the school year, including traditional in-school learning and a possible combination of in-school and distance learning, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Upset by “rampant” violations of New York’s pandemic-fighting restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo threatened Sunday to pull liquor licenses of scofflaw restaurants and even reinstate closings in areas where local governments fail to enforce rules. Manhattan and Long Island’s tony Hamptons were singled out as problem areas by Cuomo, who said the state has received 25,000 complaints of reopening violations. He said the violations endanger the state’s fragile progress in the fight against the new coronavirus as it slowly relaxes restrictions enacted in March. “We are not kidding around with this. You’re talking about jeopardizing people’s lives,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing. The warning comes a day after the Democractic governor reacted sternly to a short Twitter video from New York City of young people enjoying a warm day packed tightly on a city street, many without masks. New York officials are trying to avoid the fate of states seeing a surge in new cases after reopening. New York’s coronavirus-related hospitalizations are declining and the state recorded 23 deaths Saturday, the lowest one-day coronavirus death toll since the early days of the crisis.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nPine Hall: Stock car racing has turned into the leading battleground over COVID-19 crowd restrictions in North Carolina, as track owners have taken their fight to reopen to the streets and to court. But on Saturday, a protest at one race track attracted so few people that the demonstration was legal under the state’s restrictions. The News & Observer reported that at 311 Speedway in Stokes County, fewer than 25 people showed up to protest, despite a live band and a free cheeseburger and fries with a ticket purchase. Gov. Roy Cooper’s coronavirus restrictions limit outdoor gatherings to 25 people. Even as the race began about 7 p.m., the stands sat largely empty. By sundown, the stands had nearly filled – hundreds more fans than the 25 allowed. But the protest had fizzled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: City officials are debating whether to ask voters in November if they should legalize fireworks within city limits. The Bismarck Tribune reported voters banned possession of fireworks within city limits in 1988 and affirmed that stance a year later. But Mayor Steve Bakken has proposed legalizing fireworks, saying families should be able to spend quality time together in the city during the coronavirus pandemic. “I think there is something we can do to clean this up a little bit and maybe relax some more statutes,” Bakken said during a city commission meeting. “People are looking for things to do with their families outside while social distancing, and shooting off fireworks fits that perfectly.” Commissioner Shawn Oban questioned why the commission was discussing legalizing fireworks when there has been no public demand for such a move. He also pointed to statistics showing a drop in police, fire and ambulance calls during the 1988 Fourth of July celebration after the ban was enacted. “I don’t see a hard enough ‘why’ to put it on the ballot,” he said. The commission planned to continue discussion after July 4.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:A petition to remove the mask requirement at the Kings Island amusement park had more than 3,800 signatures Saturday morning, according to change.org. Those with season passes can return to the amusement park between July 2 and July 11, and the park will reopen to daily ticket holders on July 12. But the reopening comes with new protocols, officials said. Guests will be required to make online reservations, socially distance while at the park, take temperature checks upon entry and follow other safety measures – including wear a mask. Kings Island states on its website that all guests, associates and vendors will be required to wear masks when the park reopens. The petition stated wearing masks at the park will be difficult because of “the heat and humidity alone.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: There were 225 new coronavirus cases in Oklahoma but no additional deaths, the State Department of Health said Saturday. There have been at least 8,073 confirmed cases and 359 deaths in the state, up from 7,848 cases reported Friday. The actual number of people who have contracted a virus is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. A total of 6,495 Oklahoma residents have recovered from the illness, according to the department. Health officials on Friday warned of a spike in coronavirus cases in the Tulsa linked to indoor events and urged people attending such gatherings to take precautions. The warning comes ahead of President Donald Trump’s scheduled campaign rally in the city.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe symptoms and be fatal. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown has asked for a list of names by June 22 of inmates eligible for possible release to limit the spread of COVID-19 in the state prison system. The state Department of Corrections was asked to perform a “case-by-case analysis” of inmates who are vulnerable to the coronavirus and meet the outlined criteria for possible commutation, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. The criteria includes inmates who are particularly vulnerable, those who have not been convicted of a crime against another person and those who have served at least half of their sentences, department officials said. About 100 inmates were identified. “Given what we now know about the disease and its pervasiveness in our communities, it is appropriate to release individuals who face significant health challenges should they contract COVID-19,” said Brown, a Democrat. Studies show distancing is a challenge in prisons and jails because people live in close quarters. A 2018 study also showed Oregon has an aging prison population and houses the highest percentage of inmates over age 55 in the country.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Friday to intervene in his dispute with legislative Republicans who are trying to end pandemic restrictions he imposed in March to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Republican majorities in the House and Senate, with a few Democrats in support, voted this week to end the state’s emergency disaster declaration that Wolf has used to shut down “nonlife-sustaining” businesses, ban large gatherings and order people to stay at home. Wolf asked the state’s high court to uphold the shutdown. He said that his gradual reopening plan is working, pointing to a downward trend in the number of new virus infections in Pennsylvania even as cases rise in nearly half the states. “Pennsylvania’s measured, phased process to reopen is successful because of its cautious approach that includes factors relying on science, the advice of health experts and that asks everyone to do something as simple as wearing a mask when inside or around others outside the home,” Wolf said in a news release. “We will continue to move forward cautiously.” Wolf has been easing restrictions in vast swaths of the state, including on Friday when he announced that another eight counties would be moving to the least restrictive “green” phase of his reopening plan. But gyms, barber shops, theaters and similar businesses in the state’s highly populated southeast corner remain closed, and many types of businesses statewide must abide by occupancy limits.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 2% of Rhode Island residents have been infected with the new coronavirus, with infection rates apparently higher among the state’s minority populations, according to a state Department of Health study. The numbers aligned with prior department data that found that people of color in the state have been disproportionately affected by the disease, Dr. Philip Chan, an infectious disease consultant at the department said during a remote news conference Friday. The state provided blood tests to 1,032 volunteers to see if they had signs of a past infection. Overall, 2.2% had antibodies, which the body produces to fight an infection. The rates appeared higher in blacks and Latinos/Hispanics, but the numbers of people tested in those groups was small. The numbers were unexpectedly low, but Chan credited that to the state’s “robust response” to the pandemic. The state randomly selected 5,000 households to get the test at one of several Stop & Shop supermarket locations. More than one person from some households received a test, conducted last month. The numbers can be used by the state to better direct resources to where they are needed most, Chan said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Bowling alleys can now reopen in South Carolina after being closed for nearly three months to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections, even though the state’s COVID-19 case load is seeing its largest increases since the pandemic began. Gov. Henry McMaster issued a seventh state of emergency declaration Thursday, lifting any virus-related restrictions on the number of people inside stores and opening bowling alleys. The guidelines suggest that operators ask bowlers to bring their own balls and shoes, use only every other lane to maintain social distancing, make hand sanitizer available and put disinfectant on surfaces bowlers could touch. The additional relaxing of COVID-19 restrictions comes even though the virus continues to spread in South Carolina, which set another state record Friday with 770 new COVID-19 infections reported. McMaster has said the onus of stopping the spread is now on individuals who should wear masks, practice social distancing and wash hands. He said the state can’t shut down businesses and require people to stay home again. The governor can only issue a state of emergency for 15-day increments. Some members of the General Assembly have said the law requires the governor to consult them after each increment, but McMaster said he doesn’t have to do that because each declaration is distinct and different.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The City Council is deciding whether to leave business restrictions becauser of the coronavirus pandemic in place for another month or leave the option open to business owners. The council passed emergency restrictions at the end of April that required restaurants, bars and other businesses serving customers to engage in certain practices meant to slow the spread of the virus. That includes cutting capacity in half, configuring tables to meet social distancing guidelines and requiring face masks for food service workers. The council was scheduled to discuss the options Monday, the Rapid City Journal reported. If extended, the restrictions would stay in place until July 10. Meanwhile, state health department officials reported Saturday that a woman in her 50s from Pennington County was the 75th person in the state to die from the virus. It is the eighth COVID-19 death in the county, which includes Rapid City.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:The Nashville Symphony board of directors decided Friday to suspend programs until August 2021 and furlough its music director and other full-time staff and dozens of musicians because of the coronavirus pandemic. The symphony has had to cancel or reschedule more than 65 concerts and events since March and projects losses from the pandemic to reach $8 million, nearly 30% of its annual income, it said in a news release. The board voted to furlough 79 musicians and 49 full-time staff members, including Music Director Giancarlo Guerrero, effective July 1.“First and foremost, we are dedicated to ensuring the safety and well-being of our patrons, along with our musicians, staff and volunteers, board Chairman Mark Peacock said in the release. “That means doing everything we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. With operational costs totaling $2.3 million every month, we also face an enormous financial risk because of the continuing uncertainty caused by this pandemic.” Nashville Musicians Association President Dave Pomeroy said the local wants to help work out details of the orchestra’s safe return when the time comes.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso:Protests against the killing of George Floyd were held in the city on May 31, June 3, June 10 and June 11. Protests in support of El Paso police officers were also held June 10. The local health authority recommends participants in those protests monitor their health closely. “I would recommend that those people that participated in the marches get tested between five to seven days after exposure if they are asymptomatic (without symptoms),” said City/County Health Authority Dr. Hector Ocaranza said in a statement. Testing should come sooner if a person develops symptoms for the virus, he said. Coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough and loss of taste and smell. Those who develop symptoms “should be tested as soon as possible because there is community spread so someone might have contracted the virus somewhere else before the marches and maybe started experiencing symptoms one or two days after the march,” Ocaranza said. “You must always listen to your body.” Gov. Greg Abbott has directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to work with cities where there have been large-scale protests to expand testing at walk-up and drive-thru sites.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Bicycling has become a major hit for St. George in the era of COVID-19, but it could extend far beyond pandemic times and become commonplace activity for residents in the future. “There are some big projects coming in the next few years that will huge for connectivity and will make it all the more accessible for people to solely ride bikes if they want to,” said Dannielle Larkin, a member of the city council. “Or just have it be an addition to their travel if they want to have a car and bike, it just gives options and is a great healthy alternative.” St. George has long been a destination for people who like to spend time outdoors. But with the introduction of COVID-19 on American shores earlier this year, it became clear that being outside and around others would become increasingly rare. So the people of St. George started hitting the streets with their bikes instead. “Bikes are the new toilet paper and it’s super awesome,” Red Rock Cycling Co. employee Logan Toomer said. “People are getting out and being active and it’s great to see.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott expressed disappointment at the scale of the Legislature’s coronavirus-related economic recovery package as well as the pace at which lawmakers have moved on it. Three weeks ago, the Republican governor proposed a $400 million package of federal funds, including $310 million for small businesses, agriculture, housing and consumers. “We were inclusive in this work in hopes that it would move through the Legislature quickly and largely intact. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear that it’s going to be the case as they’re only including about a third of the money we recommended,” he said. Instead, the Vermont House on Friday passed a package that would use just $93 million in federal funds allocated for the coronavirus response. It includes $50 million in emergency economic recovery grants to businesses, $20 million in grants to be distributed by local, regional, and state economic development organizations, and $23 million for the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board for grants to nonprofit housing partners, service organizations and for shelter facilities. The Legislature said other relief packages using the federal funds will follow. The Legislature did not use Scott’s plan because lawmakers found that some of the administration’s proposed uses for the funds were not authorized, and any loans made with the funds had to be paid back to the federal government by the end of December, a timeline that wouldn’t work for many businesses that did not want to take on more debt, House Speaker Mitzi Johnson’s office said.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: A medical supply company created by two political consultants during the coronavirus pandemic have filed a lawsuit alleging that officials at a Virginia bank caused the firm to lose a $600 million equipment order and ruined its reputation. The Washington Post reported that in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Alexandria on Friday, Blue Flame Medical LLC alleged that officers of Chain Bridge Bank improperly told California officials that the company might be “fraudulent,” prompting the state to suspend its contract with Blue Flame and demand return of a $450 million down payment. State and local officials across the country ran into a confusing international market as they sought to secure personal protective equipment this spring. The lawsuit alleges that the Republican consultants who founded Blue Flame – John Thomas and Michael Gula – suffered damage to their personal reputations as a result of the bank’s actions. Chain Bridge Bank rejected the claims. The bank “acted properly and fulfilled its legal and regulatory responsibilities,” spokesman Rich Danker said. Ethan Bearman, Blue Flame’s general counsel, said the lawsuit was the beginning of a process “of setting the record straight” about Blue Flame. He said the company “has persevered and completed deliveries to satisfied customers.”\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Washington Department of Health said coronavirus infections are on the increase in the eastern and western sides of the state. The situation report said state epidemiologists have seen a particularly large increases in Benton, Yakima, Spokane and Franklin counties, but said the latest data through the end of May indicates likely increases in infections across the state. The results, the report said, included increases in coronavirus transmission over Memorial Day weekend, but not infections that might have occurred during recent protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people together in cities and towns across the state. The Seattle Times reported that Gov. Jay Inslee warned that the report indicates that “cases and deaths will soon increase substantially if COVID-19 continues to spread at the current levels.” Inslee said outbreaks in Benton, Franklin and Yakima counties are of “particular concern” and said he joined scientists and health and political leaders in those communities during a conference Saturday. The DOH report stated that six Washington counties – Yakima, Klickitat, Benton, Franklin, Spokane and Stevens – have not yet reached their peak number of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A coronavirus outbreak at a church has caused at least 17 virus cases, prompting Gov. Jim Justice to call in the National Guard for decontamination work, state officials said Saturday. The Greenbrier County church has closed for 14 days, and health officials started contact tracing to try to contain the virus’s spread, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. It’s the most recent of five confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks at churches in West Virginia, officials said. “I want to strongly encourage all West Virginians, especially when in church settings, to follow the guidelines and use every other pew, maintain social distancing and please wear masks,” Justice said in a release. “A lot of the attendance at our churches are those that are elderly and at higher risk, so we are cautioning everyone to strictly follow our guidelines.” The governor warned that things “will only get rougher” if people don’t follow health guidelines until a vaccine becomes available. Justice ordered the National Guard to go immediately to the site to begin decontamination, the state said. The governor also directed officials to hold two additional free testing events in Greenbrier County. The other counties where coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in churches are Boone, Hampshire, Jefferson, and Marshall counties, state officials said. To protect the possibility of identifying people, they said, the churches will not be named by the health and human resources department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:University of Wisconsin System officials are offering campuses guidelines for reopening this fall amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that the system released the guidelines Sunday. They include putting classes of more than 50 students online, having a plan if COVID-19 cases spike, reevaluating dorm and dining operations, using masks and keeping students that share classes together in the dorms. Rob Cramer, system vice president for administration, said the recommendations are broad so individual chancellors can decide how to handle reopening. Some UW schools said dorms will be open and be allowed to fill to capacity. Schools also are creating isolation areas where sick students would be quarantined but could still access their courses online and have food delivered to them. Mask requirements will vary from campus to campus. UW-Platteville Chancellor Dennis Shields told the Journal Sentinel that students who won’t wear masks might not be allowed to attend his university. UW-Madison has yet to announce any reopening plans. A UW-Madison spokesman told the Journal Sentinel that school might release something by next week.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Legislature will not be meeting in a special session later this month after lawmakers said they completed work they needed to accomplish in response to immediate economic and social impacts caused by the coronavirus pandemic. House Speaker Steve Harshman and Senate President Drew Perkins said in a joint letter that an anticipated five-day special session expected in late June is no longer necessary, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. “We are confident the Governor will implement our legislative directives addressing the needs of the State without the Legislature meeting in the near term,” the letter said. The announcement came after several committees were working on proposals to address the impacts of COVID-19. The decision was made in part because of the lack of federal action, Harshman said, adding that another special session could be held either later this summer or in the fall depending on the state’s needs. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/15"}]}

In addition, since many people pay off their credit cards via an automatic transfer, it's easy for small mistakes to slip through.\n\nPerhaps that's not a big deal if it's a one-time mistake -- maybe a restaurant misreading your handwriting. Not checking your credit card bill, however, could potentially let something more nefarious slip through: small charges for subscriptions that recur each month.\n\nWhat's happening?\n\nIf someone steals your credit card number and runs up a huge bill quickly, it will be obvious to you as well as your credit card provider. That still happens, of course, but some thieves are going for a more subtle approach. They obtain access to a stolen credit card number and use it to create accounts at Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, and other similar services.\n\nThese charges are less likely to be noticed by the cardholder. In some cases, they're not paying attention and in others, they may also be a customer of the service, paid for on another card or via another method.\n\nEarn rewards on your spending: See the best credit cards\n\nIf you have a Spotify subscription and see a charge from the music service on your credit card, it's easy to overlook and for the criminal to get a long-term free ride. That's bad, but it's not the worst thing that can happen, according to ACI Worldwide Senior Fraud Consultant Seth Ruden.\n\nMore: Get your tax refund before you file? Here's why it's happening (it's a scam)\n\nMore: Credit card debt: The 25 U.S. cities with the most as it relates to income\n\nMore: Credit scores: Most Americans have not checked it in 6 months\n\n\"It's not uncommon for fraudsters to use subscription merchants for testing cards with small transactions before the real high-dollar fraud takes place,\" he wrote in an email to The Motley Fool. \"The cost to use one of these inexpensive merchants doesn't eat into available funds on the card and isn't expected to set off alarms when attempted if the merchant is familiar to the user.\"\n\nRuden, who has worked with banks and law enforcement to detect and mitigate financial and cyber-crimes since 2004, also shared some variants of this scam to watch out for. He explained that there are markets where hackers can sell working accounts at services like the ones named above.\n\n\"Subscription merchants take many forms, including digital content delivery,\" he wrote.\"The likelihood of the merchant being attacked is usually a factor of their product's liquidity, either for sale on a secondary market, or into a different payment channel, like a prepaid debit card. Many stored value products can be resold on secondary markets, online auctions, or P2P exchanges.\"\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nCheck your credit card bill frequently and be skeptical. Even if you see a charge for a service, product, or website you use, make sure that the cost is correct and that the card you're looking at is the one used to pay that bill.\n\nThis is a small-time scam that can either pave the way for a big purchase on your card or slowly add up to a lot of money. The easiest way to fix this is to be vigilant. Make checking your credit card statement something you do often -- at least once a week -- and if you see something, alert your card company.\n\nIn most cases, you can do this in your credit card provider's app on your smartphone. Most companies even allow you to report fraudulent or questionable charges right from the app or website.\n\nHaving to get a new credit card is a hassle, but it's less of a problem than noticing fraud months later or after it becomes a major charge. A little vigilance goes a long way toward keeping these issues small and stopping them quickly.\n\nDaniel B. Kline has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

SAVAGE:2 Delaware high school stars to face off in NFC Championship game\n\nGodwin was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2019, his third NFL season. He led the Bucs with 110 yards receiving in their 31-26 win over the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship game on Jan. 24.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\n\"There aren’t many of us from Delaware in the league,\" Godwin said. \"I really take pride in that. I take pride in being one of the few guys that was able to make it.\"\n\nImagine the reaction from Godwin's parents, Rod and Lisa, who watched their son catch a 52-yard pass in the victory over the Packers, followed by converting a third-down in the final minute with a 6-yard run to clinch a spot in the Super Bowl.\n\nOr when they hear Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, perhaps the greatest quarterback of all time, say this about their son when asked about Godwin giving up his jersey No. 12 for No. 14 when Brady joined the team this season:\n\n\"I just love my experience with Chris,\" Brady said. \"He’s a stud, no matter what number he’s wearing. He’s a baller. He could wear any number and be great.\"\n\nWell, how would you react?\n\n\"It's been like a dream,\" Rod Godwin said. \"You’re watching, and you can’t believe it’s happening, but you do believe it’s happening.\"\n\n\"I felt like I was floating on a cloud,\" Lisa Godwin said.\n\nThat feeling started early for the Godwins.\n\nDELAWARE'S NFL PLAYERS:How NFL players with Delaware ties fared in 2020, and a possible dream matchup for Chris Godwin, Darnell Savage\n\n'The 4-to-12 shift'\n\nLisa Godwin said Chris was 6 years old and playing in the New Castle County Football League when one of the parents approached and said: \"What are you guys teaching this kid, because this kid has it.\"\n\nRod and Lisa Godwin were teaching Chris about humility, about working hard, about never settling.\n\nA few years later, Godwin's cousin Zory Godwin was playing for Middletown in the 2007 DIAA state championship game when Rod Godwin introduced young Chris to the coaching staff.\n\n\"I told them, ‘This kid is going to play for you one day, and you’re going to love him,'\" Rod Godwin said.\n\nNeedless to say, he was right.\n\nMiddletown went to the state finals in 2010, Chris' freshman year. The Cavaliers won the title the next two years, and made it back to the finals in 2013.\n\nGodwin and quarterback Darius Wade had teamed up beginning that freshman season, and many around Middletown referred to them as, \"the 4-to-12 shift.\"\n\nThat represented Wade's No. 4 and Godwin's No. 12.\n\nWade saw this relationship brewing during training camp leading into their freshman season. But first, Wade saw that Middletown had a rising junior quarterback returning, so he approached the coaching staff and asked if he could switch to wide receiver because he wanted to play right away.\n\nThe coaches shook their head no, and pointed to Godwin. Wade looked over and saw the broad-shouldered 6-foot, 180-pounder at the time, and said, incredulously, \"He's a freshman?\"\n\nWade ended up winning the starting quarterback job that summer anyway. He said in the first two games that season, the offense was more run-heavy just because of his and Godwin's inexperience.\n\nBut in the third game, at Smyrna, Wade was allowed to throw more.\n\n\"That was like our breakout game,\" Wade said. \"Chris had a third-down reception, broke a bunch of tackles and scored. He had another third-down catch, scored again.\n\n\"After that, we were rolling. It showed both of us that we could play at this level and we could dominate. We did that again in the championship game (a loss to St. Mark's). As freshmen, we weren't expected to seize the moment because of the pressure, but we showed that we could.\"\n\nMaking everyone better\n\nIt didn't take long before Rod and Lisa Godwin would know that their son had done something remarkable on the football field without even seeing it.\n\n\"I remember one time, I was at the concession stand at Middletown,\" Lisa Godwin said. \"They kicked the ball to Chris, and all I could hear was the crowd erupt. It just kept getting louder and louder. I just knew that was Chris running back a kick for a touchdown.\"\n\nRod Godwin laughed, \"He returned like 15 punts and kicks for touchdowns, so they stopped kicking the ball to him.\"\n\nWade said having Godwin helped, and not only because he could always count on Godwin on third down, or late in a close game when the Cavaliers needed a play.\n\nHe said opponents paid so much attention to Godwin that other receivers like Thomas Davis, Dennis Berger and Jordan Griffin were open, so he threw to them, too.\n\n\"It's just like in the NFL with Chris,\" Wade said. \"He takes so much pressure off of everyone else. But whenever we needed a big play, Chris was always reliable.\"\n\nThe only difference is Godwin has Brady throwing to him, with Mike Evans and Scotty Miller at wide receiver, and Rob Gronkowski and Cameron Brate at tight end.\n\nStill, the results are similar.\n\nGodwin's 52-yard reception late in the first half of the NFC Championship game, in which Godwin leaped over safety Darnell Savage, a Delaware native who played at Caravel Academy, came on third down.\n\nAnd really, the Bucs saw this ever since Bruce Arians became the head coach in 2019 and decided to move Godwin to slot receiver.\n\n\"(Godwin) really brings a lot to the table just from his physicality,\" Bucs wide receivers coach Kevin Garver said this week on a Super Bowl Zoom call. \"He's going to be involved in the run game. He can make those grimy catches, has the ability to run great routes and get off press coverage. That's really the fit that we saw in him.\"\n\nGodwin had career highs with 86 receptions for 1,333 yards receiving in his 2019 Pro Bowl season. This season, Godwin missed four games with injuries, but still finished second to Mike Evans with 840 yards receiving on 65 receptions.\n\nIn the playoffs, Godwin is tied for the team lead with 14 catches and has the most receiving yards, 233.\n\nRuns 'like a gazelle'\n\nIt was like this at Penn State, too.\n\nGodwin wasn't a starter as a freshman, but in the Pinstripes Bowl at the end of the season – against Wade and Boston College – Godwin had 7 catches for 140 yards, including a 72-yard touchdown.\n\nWade said he remembered warning the Boston College defensive backs leading up to that game about Godwin. \"That's my boy from high school,\" Wade said. \"Don't sleep on him.\"\n\nWade added, \"They were like, 'we watched the film. He's not that fast. We're not too worried.' I tried to tell them, he might not look fast, but don't let that fool you. The way he runs is like a gazelle. It might not look like his legs are moving fast, but he'll run right by you.\"\n\nSure enough, Godwin followed up that game with 1,101 yards receiving as a sophomore. Then the last game of his junior year, Godwin had 187 yards receiving and two touchdowns in the Rose Bowl, which Penn State lost 52-49 to Southern Cal.\n\nGodwin was a third-round pick in the 2017 draft and quickly became one of the better receivers in the NFL.\n\n\"When you get in (the NFL) or you’re in college, everyone has talent if you make it to that level,\" Rod Godwin said. \"But there are some players that just help you win all the time, and that’s Christopher.\"\n\nIt's not necessarily being the top receiver, either. As a slot receiver, Godwin is often blocking on running plays, and he is more than happy when other receivers catch passes.\n\n\"Once you get into the playoffs, it doesn’t matter how pretty the win is, it doesn’t matter how it looks,\" Godwin said. \"It could be the ugliest game ever, as long as you win. You win and you advance. That’s kind of been our (mantra).\"\n\nAdded Rod Godwin: \"That's the way he was with his Middletown teammates. He was always just one of the guys on the team. He never tried to act like he was any better than anybody on that team.\n\n\"If there was something the team had to do, he did it. He never tried to bring any attention to himself. Everything was about the team. He never threw anybody under the bus, and he still doesn’t do that.\"\n\nA brighter future\n\nGodwin's parents will be in Tampa for the Super Bowl, along with their daughter, Rian, who's 20. They also have a daughter, Sharhonda Rosser, 36, and a son, Marcus Rosser, 32.\n\nThere will be also be plenty of family and friends watching in Middletown and Philadelphia, where the Godwins lived before moving to Delaware when Chris was 3.\n\nWade will be watching, too.\n\nHe went from Boston College to the University of Delaware, but left there before playing a game and ended up at Bowling Green, where he finished his eligibility after the 2019 season.\n\nWade will leave for Germany in about a month to play for a team in the German Football League, hoping for a chance in the NFL or Canadian Football League.\n\nHe will be rooting for Godwin, ecstatic for his success, and not surprised about it.\n\n\"I knew he always had the foundation and the capacity to be an elite player,\" Wade said. \"With a lot of players, you wonder about the drive to keep getting better once they got it made. But you never worry about that with Chris. He just keeps working and keeps getting better.\"\n\nGodwin doesn't take any of it for granted. Not playing in his first Super Bowl, and not with what lies ahead with the possibility of free agency. If the Bucs don't sign him before free agency begins in March, he'll no doubt be one of the most sought-after wide receivers.\n\nGodwin said \"that stuff is for later down the road,\" and that he's focused on the Super Bowl and finishing up the two best back-to-back seasons of his career.\n\n\"It's even cooler now, because this is the biggest dream I had when I was a kid,\" Godwin said comparing the Super Bowl to making the Pro Bowl. \"To kind of have both of those dreams in back-to-back years, I can't even explain it.\"\n\nThen he added: \"I think the next thing for me is letting the kids know from Delaware that if you’re from a small like we are, you can do whatever you put your mind to.\n\n\"That dream isn’t far out of reach. You just gotta work hard for it.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Spring practice starts a few weeks later and Arrington will be among those trying to earn a role in the Blue Hens' rebuilding defense, despite not having played high school football.\n\nSo who is Keeno Arrington?\n\nAbout that name\n\nKeeno is the son of Lavar Arrington, a recent College Football Hall of Fame inductee who was a two-time first-team All-American linebacker at Penn State. He was then the second pick of the 2000 NFL Draft by Washington and played seven pro seasons.\n\nKeeno was born in 2000. But Lavar and his mother, Katey, who'd known each other since attending high school in Pittsburgh, didn't stay together long. Keeno grew up with his mother in Pittsburgh, though he did frequently see his father, who married his wife Trish, had four children and moved to the Los Angeles area. Keeno eventually took the last name of his stepfather, Keenan Holmes.\n\nLavar and Keeno had no contact for more than eight years from roughly 2013 to 2021, Keeno said, because of \"family disputes that were over my head.\"\n\nA high school star — in basketball\n\nKeeno Holmes frequently made his own headlines, but it was as a basketball player. He was on Lincoln Park teams that reached four Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League title games and won two WPIAL titles, plus a PIAA Class 3A championship.\n\n\"Once I started playing basketball there,\" he said, \"started doing the AAU travel thing in the summer, that kinda of eliminated summer workouts and camp for football. So slowly I started doing basketball all year round to the point it was kind of like the only thing I do.\"\n\n2023 SCHEDULE:Delaware opens with CAA road game before Penn State trip\n\nKeeno scored 1,658 career points and earned a WPIAL 3A Player of the Year award. He then attended nearby Division III Allegheny College, starting and averaging 9.6 points per game as a freshman in 2019-20.\n\n\"I really wouldn't change anything,\" he said of those experiences.\n\nA new perspective\n\nWith no basketball season in 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and schoolwork being done remotely, he reassessed his family situation and athletic priorities while quarantined at home.\n\nWith plenty of time to mull his own athletic pursuits, Keeno felt the urge to give football a shot and began training with that in mind. He hadn't been on a football team since sixth grade. It was only natural then, he felt, to re-establish contact with his father.\n\n\"I just felt spiritually pushed to reach out to my dad and rekindle that relationship,\" he said.\n\nLaVar was happy to reconnect with his son and aid in his football endeavors.\n\n\"We all just feel whole again,\" Keeno said. \" . . . A lot of tension and heartache is out the window.\"\n\nA return to football\n\nLackawanna Junior College in Scranton, Pennsylvania, gave Arrington the chance to play football, which, he confessed \"scared me to death.\"\n\nCoaches urged him to \"be a sponge,\" and listen, observe and ask questions. Arrington was limited to special teams duty in his first season, in 2021. The biggest challenge, he said, was the physical aspect.\n\nHe turned out to be a quick learner.\n\nBUILDING BLOCKS:Delaware December recruits revealed\n\nLast fall Arrington became a starter, seeing action at linebacker, safety and cornerback. Arrington made 34 tackles, including four for lost yardage, broke up 13 passes and intercepted two.\n\n\"By the time I got to my second season I was really comfortable in what I was doing,\" Arrington said.\n\nIt was truly \"a breakout season,\" he added.\n\nDelaware notices\n\nDelaware defensive coordinator Manny Rojas was among the first of several Division I FCS coaches to express recruiting interest in Arrington. It didn't hurt that Rojas also has Pittsburgh roots. That helped pave Arrington's way to Delaware, which he chose after also getting scholarship offers from several of the Blue Hens' CAA rivals.\n\n\"When I talked to coach Rojas on the phone, I kinda knew that was the place I wanted to go,\" Arrington said. \"Him being a Pittsburgh guy, that connection, we speak a similar language. He's a blue-collar guy.\"\n\nThe message Arrington got from Delaware was \"We love you as a player,\" he said, and it sounded sincere.\n\nA visit to Delaware confirmed those feelings. UD coaches view Arrington, he said, as \"a Swiss Army knife\" in their three- or four-safety alignment capable of run-stopping, pass-covering and blitzing duties.\n\n\"When a program like that wants you,\" he said, \"they know something.\"\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

The Eagles drafted Sanders, from Penn State, in the second round, 53rd overall, on Friday night. They took Stanford wide receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside four picks later.\n\nNFL draft, second round: Eagles pick Miles Sanders, J.J. Arcega-Whiteside\n\nThe Eagles added another Penn State standout on Saturday in defensive end Shareef Miller with their fourth-round pick, No. 138 overall. The Eagles then traded their fifth-round pick, No. 163, to New England to pick four spots later. The Eagles also got a seventh-round pick, No. 246 overall, in return.\n\nThey traded that seventh-round pick to the Colts for defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway, a fourth round pick in 2016, who played in only five games last season. He has 4.5 sacks in three seasons.\n\nAll things Eagles: Latest Philadelphia Eagles news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nIn the fifth round, the Eagles took Northwestern quarterback Clayton Thorson. It is worth wondering if the Eagles wanted to get Easton Stick, the quarterback at North Dakota State who took over for Carson Wentz and led the Bison to two FCS championships.\n\nThe Chargers took Stick one pick before the Eagles. Had the Eagles not made the trade, they could have had their choice.\n\nAs a senior, Thorson, who's 6-foot-4, 222 pounds, completed 61.1 percent of his passes for 3,183 yards and 17 touchdowns. But Thorson also finished with the second-most interceptions among FBS quarterbacks with 15.\n\nThorson's father, Chad, was a linebacker for the Eagles during training camp in 1991.\n\n\"I think he was there with Reggie White,\" Thorson said. \"He really enjoyed his time there. He wasn’t there for long, but he enjoyed it.\"\n\nMiller, who's 6-4, 254 pounds, grew up in Philadelphia. Miller had 7.5 sacks at Penn State last season. He will join a rotation at defensive end that includes veterans Brandon Graham and Vinny Curry and young players Derek Barnett and Josh Sweat.\n\nSanders, meanwhile, said Saturday he was grateful to be picked so early. After all, he rarely played at Penn State until last season because he was behind a pretty good running back in Saquon Barkley, who was the No. 2 overall pick last year by the Giants and the NFL's offensive rookie of the year in 2018.\n\nYet Sanders said he never considered transferring, and he never pouted.\n\nUniversity of Delaware's Nasir Adderley drafted by Chargers in second round\n\n\"I gained a lot of patience,\" Sanders said. \"I got more mature. Started focusing on the little things more. Got bigger, stronger, faster. Got more deep into the playbook. Just prepare myself and make myself feel comfortable for when I finally get my chance to get into the game.\"\n\nSanders took advantage, gaining 1,274 yards last season and averaging 5.8 yards per carry. Sanders had 56 carries for 375 yards combined his first two seasons.\n\nThe Eagles were convinced, however, taking him in the exact same slot at No. 53 that LeSean McCoy was selected back in 2009. McCoy is the Eagles' all-time leading rusher.\n\nAnd Sanders was a big fan, growing up in Pittsburgh, a few hours from McCoy's hometown of Harrisburg.\n\n\"He’s pretty local,\" Sanders said. \"I heard about him when he came up in high school. Broke a lot of records at his high school, too. I know a lot about his game. He’s still doing well in the league. Just a type of player you see as a real vet, someone you can look up to and get advice. … That’s the type of career that I would like to follow.\"\n\nNFL draft: Eagles trade up, snag Jason Peters' replacement at left tackle\n\nArcega-Whiteside also grew up emulating an Eagles player. He's from South Carolina, where current Eagles wide receiver Alshon Jeffery grew up and starred in college.\n\n\"That's a guy that everybody in the state knew,\" Arcega-Whiteside said. \"As a kid, it's like, 'Dang, I want to be him one day.'\"\n\nThat remains to be seen. But Arcega-Whiteside also has connections to another influential person in former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice, a Stanford distinguished professor, whom Arcega-Whiteside worked for last summer.\n\n\"I like to say I was her first body of defense,\" he said with a laugh. \"Anybody who wanted to contact her, meet with her they had to go through me first, which was cool because I got to meet some extraordinary people from around the world.\"\n\nWhen asked to elaborate, he replied: \"I don't know how confidential they want me to keep that. I'll just say I met some ambassadors, Russian ambassador, Chinese ambassadors.\"\n\nSanders said he won't have trouble fitting into a rotation that currently includes Jordan Howard, whom the Eagles traded for earlier this month, plus returnees Wendell Smallwood, Corey Clement and Josh Adams.\n\nHe learned that mostly at Penn State. Sanders said his games mostly came in practice, competing against Barkley.\n\n\"In practice, every day, I’m getting better, trying to prove myself to get on the field,\" he said. \"(Barkley) is always trying to make sure he doesn’t lose the job. It’s just like that ... We worked together to make each other better.\n\n\"I’m not a selfish player. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to help this team win.\"\n\nArcega-Whiteside said the same thing about the Eagles' wide receivers. In addition to knowing Jeffery, he also knows tight end Zach Ertz, a Stanford alum. Arcega-Whiteside shares a trainer with Nelson Agholor and an agent with Mack Hollins.\n\n\"Everyone in that receiver room is great,\" Arcega-Whiteside said. \"I'm very comfortable with coming into the meeting room knowing some guys already.\"\n\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

And betting at Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington means no longer filling out a parlay card with three or more teams and turning your money over with about a 7/1 chance of actually getting anything back.\n\nNew Jersey is putting the final pieces to the puzzle together and will soon launch sports betting and become the epicenter of sports gambling on the east coast. Legislation isn't far behind in Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York and elsewhere.\n\nBut, for now, all eyes will be on Delaware Tuesday.\n\nAnd speaking of those parlay cards? Forget about them.\n\nNever placed a sports bet before? Need a little refresher? Want to know what Golden State -5 means for Game 3 of the NBA Finals Wednesday night or how to bet the Phillies on the road against the Cubs Tuesday night? We've got you covered.\n\nHere's how you can sound like an expert when you get to the betting window Tuesday and get your first, legal straight bet in Delaware.\n\nImportant terms and phrases\n\nBook: The sportsbook is an establishment that accepts wagering on sports. In Delaware, the three sportsbooks are Delaware Park, Dover Downs and Harrington Raceway.\n\nPoint spread: The point spread — or betting \"line\" as it is sometimes called — is the value assigned by the bookmaker that reflects an expected outcome of a game. For example, early indications are that Golden State is favored by 5 points (-5) against Cleveland in Game 3 of the NBA Finals Wednesday night. This means that Golden State is \"giving up\" five points to Cleveland and must win by 6 to cover the point spread. If you bet Cleveland +5, you win if the Cavaliers lose by less than 5 points or win the game outright. Typically, bets on the point spread are usually offered at 11-to-10 odds, meaning — for the sake of round numbers — a $110 bet will win the bettor $100.\n\nOver/under: The over/under (sometimes written o/u) of a game is the total points expected to be scored. Like the point spread, over/under bets are usually offered at 11-to-10 odds.\n\nPush: Quite simply, a tie. For example: if you have Golden State -5 Wednesday night, and the Warriors beat the Cavs by 5, the game is a push. Both Warriors and Cavaliers bettors get their wagers back.\n\nTaking the points: When someone \"takes the points,\" they're typically talking about betting the underdog (like Cleveland +5).\n\nUnderdog: The team most likely to lose, based on the betting odds. Many refer to this as the \"dog.\"\n\nVigorish: There's always the vig. The vigorish is the commission or \"juice\" the casino takes. In our previous example, betting $110 on Golden State returns the bettor $210 instead of $220.\n\nTypes of bets\n\nStraight bet: This is the hallmark of what makes Tuesday so historic. A straight bet is an individual wager on a game or event that will be determined by a point spread, money line or over/under.\n\nParlay: Like many Delawareans are probably familiar with, a parlay is a single bet that strings together two or more wagers and offers better payouts, but every leg of the parlay must hit for the bettor to win.\n\nMoney line bet: Bettors also have the option of betting on a team to win the game without the use of the point spread, meaning the margin of victory does not matter. This option means betting a favorite to win requires betting more money to get a desired return. For example, Golden State will be around -200 on the money line to win Game 3 Wednesday. Bettors would need to put down $200 to win $100. On the other end, betting an underdog to win usually comes with a good payout. The Cavaliers will be around +170 or more to win the game Wednesday. In that case, a bet of $100 wins the bettor $170.\n\nFuture: A future is a wager placed on an event such as which team will win next year’s Super Bowl (the Eagles are 8/1 to repeat) or Master's golf tournament.\n\nTeaser: Many Delawareans are already aware of a teaser, since the NFL parlay card system also allowed for teasers, a bet that adjusts point spreads in a player's favor but lessens the potential payout.\n\n________________________\n\nWe've covered above the typical ways to bet on an NBA game, but the Stanley Cup playoffs are nearing completion, and baseball season is in full swing. Here's how you bet on those sports.\n\nBetting on hockey\n\nBetting on hockey consists usually of money line bets, puck line bets (hockey's point spread) and over/under bets.\n\nMonday night in Game 4 (Washington leads the series 2-1), the Washington Capitals are favored to beat Las Vegas. The Capitals are -130 on the money line and the Golden Knights are +110.\n\nIn most all hockey games, the puck line or point spread attached to the game is -1.5 goals. The odds of the favorite winning by more than one goal are then assigned to that line. For example, Washington is the 1.5 goal favorite Monday, but the odds of the Capitals covering the puck line is +215. So a $100 bet on the Capitals puck line Monday (they need to win by at least two) will win a bettor $215.\n\nThe over/under Monday night is 5.5 goals, a pretty standard value on most hockey games.\n\nBetting on baseball\n\nBetting on baseball is very similar to hockey. Each team is assigned a money line odd to win the game and baseball \"run lines\" (point spreads) are usually -1.5 for the favorite or +1.5 for the underdog, with odds assigned to those outcomes like explained above.\n\n________________________\n\nThe full-scale launch of betting in Delaware comes at a slow time in sports, especially for bettors. Come fall, when the NFL and college football seasons are underway and pro and college hoops are gearing up, Delaware's three sportsbooks should see plenty of traffic, especially if surrounding states continue to have holdups in launching.\n\nStill confused?

Before Aaron Zahn\n\nWhen Aaron Zahn joined the JEA board of directors in early 2018, the century-old utility was at near-peak financial performance and had never had higher customer-satisfaction rankings measured by J.D. Power, the kind of dry metrics I had heard agency officials fawn over for years in austere conference rooms over stale coffee and cold cuts.\n\nThe sun had set on the halcyon era when utilities could count on 3 percent annual growth in electric sales as a matter of faith, but a succession of CEOs had stabilized JEA's finances after years of major investments in new power plants and civic efforts, like buying conservation land for the Preservation Project. JEA, like all utilities, faced headwinds on the horizon, but Wall Street was happy, not just with an accelerated paydown of JEA's debt that Zahn's predecessor had orchestrated, but its competitive rates, its high-growth service territory and its team of executives, whom analysts trusted. JEA was a leader in the public power industry; what happened at JEA often set the tone for public utilities across the country.\n\nThis was the imperfect but enviable legacy Zahn inherited when, inexplicably, he was named the agency's chief executive just months later, despite never before having run a utility of any size. The business experience he did possess did not indicate that board members had hired a savant or a corporate-turnaround artist — as he and they tried to convince the public — but rather that they empowered an ambitious, middling climber whose chief accomplishment seemed to be his stint leading a small wastewater technology firm with a decidedly mixed record of success.\n\nJEA 'death spiral' scenarioused to justify sales attempt in 2019 hasn't happened\n\nThe indictment:Federal grand jury indicts former JEA executives on conspiracy, wire fraud\n\nNate Monroe:The fall of Aaron Zahn\n\nMark Woods:As he goes from shackles to Bahamas, Aaron Zahn has a lot to think about\n\nDuring our own efforts to check out Zahn's past, people who had worked with him or who had been customers of his company relayed to us troubling anecdotes about his time running that wastewater firm, BCR Environmental, often on the record but sometimes in private because he left a trail of non-disclosure agreements throughout his time there. A public works employee in Starke — a small North Florida hamlet about an hour southwest of Jacksonville, which had a major falling out with BCR over a failed wastewater project that left the city about $1 million in debt — had vivid memories of confrontations with Zahn, whom he remembered to be an arrogant, city-slicker huckster.\n\nA national search firm JEA hired to ostensibly conduct an above-board hiring process also heard unflattering appraisals of his leadership abilities.\n\n\"He plays within the rules, but he knows the rules so well, then you might not see it coming,\" one person said of Zahn, according to notes taken by an employee of the search firm.\n\n\"He is very good at boardroom back dealings.\"\n\nThese were not secrets when the board was — allegedly — weighing the strengths and weaknesses of CEO candidates in the fall of 2018, a talent pool that included one of the top public utility executives in the country.\n\nThese were the subjects of front-page stories, of complaints from Jacksonville City Council members alarmed at the board's search process, which from the outset appeared rigged for Zahn. The search firm's notes were available to the board of directors to review; my reporting at the time indicated only one board member bothered to look at them.\n\nThose anecdotes and critiques, as well as some of the challenges Zahn encountered during his time running BCR, were of course not a full picture of the man, who was then 38, but they were remarkable red flags that, coupled with his complete lack of experience, should have ended his candidacy to lead JEA.\n\nZahn was a stunning departure from the sort of veteran executives JEA had hired in the past to run what was, and is, one of the largest public utilities in the United States and Jacksonville's most important agency — the source of our electricity and our drinking water; a major employer with a workforce of about 2,000 strong; a $2 billion company with a footprint that touches our air, our water and our earth.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nWhen the JEA board of directors fired Zahn in January 2020, after months of controversy, the utility had lower credit ratings, lower employee morale, an uncertain future — a remarkable feat for a monopoly — and it sat at the center of public fury. JEA had fallen from being a leader in the public power industry to a pariah. “Aaron, you have us all scratching our heads,” the general manager of Lakeland Electric wrote Zahn a few months before he was fired.\n\nPast JEA chief executives sometimes struggled with media relations and the high levels of transparency Florida law requires of government agencies and officials.\n\nBut under Zahn, JEA devoted substantial brainpower to the task of active deception, perfecting the dezinformatsiya-speak of corrupt bureaucracies — weaponizing language to obscure what was happening in plain view. This duplicity was most evident in the myriad ways Zahn's JEA concocted to avoid describing for the public in plain English the very project that eventually consumed his career: Selling JEA to the highest bidder.\n\nUtility records turned over after Zahn's departure indicated JEA's PR consultants — aware of the deep unpopularity of such a proposal — purposefully avoided terms like \"sale\" and \"privatization,\" opting instead for turgid, indecipherable euphemisms they knew the public wouldn't understand: It wasn't privatization but \"recapitalization;\" not a sale but an \"extraordinary mandatory redemption,\" a \"non-traditional utility response,\" or \"strategic planning.\"\n\nZahn was not a greasy salesman but simply there to \"transition (JEA) from a centralized power producer to a decentralized, data-focused, customer-centric energy manager.\"\n\nJEA's c-suite executives, some of them longtime veterans, were initially skeptical of Zahn, who telegraphed disrespect for their contributions.\n\n\"We were distrustful of Aaron,\" one former executive recalled in a sworn interview two years ago with outside attorneys investigating the JEA privatization campaign. \"We were distrustful of the Mayor, City Council, the board. We felt like we were — we certainly were not in the know of anything that was going on. Everything that had happened, happened abruptly, very fast, and in a way that, if you told the story today, no one would believe you.\"\n\nBut over time Zahn's penchant for deception and his animosity toward private citizens critical of his tenure — a fact of life that many public officials handle professionally — permeated their ranks.\n\n“Meanwhile, as I see Nate and all the naysayers accuse us of a ‘secretive process’ and ‘playing politics,’ at the end of the day, it will end up being meaningless in the scheme of things,” one communications manager emailed his colleagues, talking about this newspaper and this columnist, a few weeks before the board of directors authorized Zahn to sell JEA.\n\n“They’re just promoting their own agenda to sell papers and win a Pulitzer (lmao) for thinking they will save Jacksonville in the guise of protecting its residents from utter turmoil.”\n\nFederal prosecutors unsealed a grand jury indictment Monday charging Zahn and Ryan Wannemacher, JEA's former chief financial officer, with conspiracy and wire fraud, accusing them of secretly planning to enrich themselves by skimming tens of millions of dollars off the top of potential JEA sale proceeds from a private buyer — money that would have otherwise gone into the city's general fund. Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges Tuesday.\n\nThe criminal charges at the heart of the indictment are narrow, but the fraud that prosecutors describe is broad: It calls nearly the entirety of Zahn's tenure at JEA a sham. He had been plotting the ultimately botched campaign to sell the utility \"before he was named the permanent CEO of JEA,\" the indictment alleges.\n\nThe grand jury indictment pierces a web of lies that propped up so much of what Zahn did at JEA.\n\nDespite the upending of his career and the peril he now faces with a criminal indictment, however, Zahn remains true to form, clinging to the fiction JEA peddled during his time there: He still refuses to acknowledge he tried to privatize the agency much less profit off it, a predictable but nonetheless breathtakingly brazen defiance given the events of the past several years.\n\nZahn, his attorney said in a statement this week, is merely guilty of \"bringing his extensive private business experience and know-how to JEA and develop innovative ways to improve the utility for the benefit of the community and its ratepayers.\"\n\n\"He challenged the stagnant conventional thinking that permeated JEA and looked for cost-effective and innovative ways, commonly used in private businesses, to diversify revenues and retain the talented employees of JEA.\"\n\nII. Curry, a political sponsor\n\nYou do not name someone like Zahn to run a complex city agency you care about or that you respect, anymore than you'd hire a newspaper columnist to lead safety-planning at a nuclear reactor.\n\nBut Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry, Zahn's political sponsor through his overnight rise and precipitous fall, did not respect or care for JEA.\n\n\"I think there's a — a misnomer, this idea that JEA has value,\" Tim Baker, Curry's longtime political consultant, told city attorneys in a sworn interview in 2020. \"JEA's value is that it overcharges for electricity and remits that excess cash back to the City as a back-door tax, that's the real value of JEA.\"\n\nBaker's words are indicative of the dismissive, uninformed attitude Curry's administration and political operation — staffed by people who have little regard for Jacksonville's history — often took toward the city's legacy institutions: JEA was bloated, irrelevant, run by rubes, in need of a businessman's touch.\n\nMark Woods: His name isn't in it, but unsealing of JEA indictment seals Lenny Curry's legacy\n\nMost of all, it was an asset to be monetized: Think of all Curry could do with those billions in sale proceeds, and the political benefit such a thing would accrue. \"Jacksonville’s new young Republican mayor is out to shrink government, and wants to privatize JEA — quickly, while the market is 'right.' He says within 3-5 months,\" a lawyer with the firm Holland & Knight wrote in a legal strategy memo to JEA executives in February 2018, just before Zahn was named the utility's interim CEO.\n\nCurry and his operatives were savvy enough to understand the entrenched unpopularity of privatizing JEA, a lesson he learned during a brief flirtation with the idea in 2018. So in his 2019 re-election campaign, Curry deployed a Zahn-like obfuscation: \"I will not be introducing legislation to sell the JEA.\"\n\nIt was blunt enough to leave an impression on a voter paying minimal attention — i.e., the vast majority of them — that Curry didn't support privatization, but its lawyerly syntax was conniving enough to leave him room to do just that, all while claiming he never violated the strict construction of his words.\n\nAnd sure enough, Curry never did introduce legislation to sell JEA.\n\nThat's why he needed Aaron Zahn.\n\nCurry's backing was Zahn's ace-in-the-hole. It was the only clear advantage his CEO candidacy possessed, and the only explanation for the board's bizarre decision to cast aside the resumes of far more experienced, less controversial candidates.\n\nAnd since Curry didn't care about JEA's long-term future, it didn't much matter that Zahn was incapable of running it, although Zahn seemed unaware of his own limitations.\n\n\"I think at least Aaron in his mind believed that he was destined to be the CEO of JEA, that he really believed that he earned it and that he was absolutely the right person at the right time to take JEA into the future,\" a former executive recalled after Zahn was fired.\n\n\"And his words and his actions, at least around me, as uncomfortable as they could be sometimes, he saw himself as a visionary leader of a utility of the future, and he believed that.\"\n\nIII. Curry's ties to FPL\n\nThere are darker theories, too, for Curry's dead-set interest in privatizing JEA. It's by now well documented the connections Curry's political operation had to Florida Power & Light, whose parent company, NextEra, bid $11 billion to purchase the city agency — which sits right in the middle of FPL's service territory. Baker, Curry's longtime political operative, was both a consultant to FPL (until the month the board voted to put JEA out for bid) and a friend and informal adviser to Zahn. Baker, during the time he worked for FPL, attended a secret offsite meeting during which JEA officials and their lawyers, bankers and consultants talked about privatization before it was public knowledge.\n\nThe federal indictment goes out of its way to mention a brief episode: Just days before the board voted to authorize Zahn to sell JEA to the highest bidder, he met with the CEO of an unnamed potential buyer in West Palm Beach and disclosed that JEA would soon be on the market — something he had gone to great lengths to keep from becoming public knowledge at the time.\n\nThis fact was not essential to the criminal case against Zahn; that federal prosecutors mentioned it anyway is notable.\n\nFederal question:Federal prosecutors say former JEA CEO met with potential buyer before board vote. Who was it?\n\nDark money and JEA:Amid JEA privatization controversy, a City Council member received a mysterious job offer. A dark-money group may have been behind it.\n\nOnly one bidder had an obvious connection to Palm Beach County: NextEra, which is headquartered there. The company did not respond to questions about the description of the company in the indictment.\n\nRegardless, the company loomed large over the privatization campaign, and only years of reporting after Zahn's firing revealed the degree to which the company had begun setting the stage to acquire its long-sought prize.\n\nNextEra hired a crack team of consultants, including Baker's business partner, Sam Mousa, who was also a former chief administrative officer under Curry. It planned charitable contributions, including to nonprofits run by members of the Jacksonville City Council. It rented a suite at TIAA Bank Field for Jaguars games, where — despite rules intended to limit contact between active JEA bidders and decision-makers — FPL executives had face-to-face contact with city officials, including the mayor's chief of staff (the city's own suite was right next door).\n\nSecret records from a consulting firm also show that on July 21 — two days after Zahn's alleged meeting with an unnamed company in West Palm Beach, and two days before the board voted to put JEA up for sale — political operatives working on behalf of FPL drafted up a memo that proposed offering a well-paying job at a sham nonprofit to Jacksonville City Council member Garrett Dennis. Dennis was a well-known critic of privatizing JEA. A summary of an internal investigation conducted by that consulting firm alleged the job offer was an effort to remove his dissent from the council, which would have had to sign off on any sale.\n\nThat sham nonprofit, Grow United, was incorporated in Delaware on July 24, one day after the consequential JEA board vote.\n\nFPL has said it rejected the deal outright, but Dennis recalled receiving — and blowing off — a job offer from an intermediary with striking similarities to the one described in the confidential records, including a requirement that he step down from the City Council.\n\nIV. A tale of a death spiral\n\nBefore anyone could acquire JEA, however, Zahn would have to come up with a pretext to sell it.\n\nNamed as interim CEO in early 2018, Zahn quickly set to work casting himself as a seer of destiny, predicting JEA would become the next Blockbuster — the iconic video-rental chain that disappeared virtually overnight because of new competition and technology — if big changes weren't made.\n\nTo justify this gloom-and-doom vision, Zahn cherry-picked and mischaracterized data to cast JEA — until then, a well-run, well-respected, stable utility — as a listing barge headed for a glacier. Over the objections of the utility's own analysts, Zahn crafted a highly speculative theory that explosive growth in rooftop solar adoption by customers would contribute to a financial \"death spiral\" for JEA: That the company would soon see an irreversible decline in electric sales despite adding new customers each year.\n\nThis theory ignored the fact that JEA was itself a pioneer of a tactic now being used by Florida's private utilities, including FPL, to strip away the financial incentive for customers to install rooftop solar panels.\n\nNever before had a JEA executive at any level broadcast such a vision of the utility's future; where did this industry neophyte glean such insight?\n\nBut Zahn bet the farm on this black-swan scenario and gave board members a false choice: He demanded they allow him to lay off nearly 30 percent of JEA's workforce immediately, or give him the greenlight to privatize, throwing the utility's considerable workforce into understandable panic. That this was not a business theory shared by the public (or private) power industry, that JEA's own filings to credit analysts and regulators didn't support it, that it was by no measure a consensus view — those facts were never shared with the board. In \"strategic planning\" meetings, this dark vision was viewed as a near-certainty.\n\nThis scare tactic, the indictment alleges, was designed to manipulate the board into believing privatization \"was necessary to avoid JEA's certain demise.\"\n\nAnd the board — incurious, lazy, compromised, or some combination of all three — swallowed this hook, line and sinker, and on July 23, 2019, it gave Zahn what he wanted: Permission to sell the agency, which has been the city's electric utility in some form since the 1880s.\n\nZahn characterized this campaign as a mere \"conversation\" with no pre-determined outcome, but a conversation requires honesty. And honesty would require a factual, fair accounting of the benefits of remaining a public utility.\n\nInstead, Zahn had IT employees delete the \"benefits of public power\" page on JEA's website, and, even as he was selling it — literally preparing to solicit offers for it — his PR managers steeled themselves for the unenviable task they would soon face: To insist that very thing was not, in fact, happening.\n\n“I think Aaron definitely wants to know how we are going to address inevitable questions and accusations that will arise from this next board meeting,” a JEA communications manager wrote a few weeks before the consequential July 23 meeting.\n\nA question-and-answer strategy document, prepared by JEA communications officials in the weeks before the July 23 vote, was even more misleading. Anticipating the question, \"Is this just a ploy to push privatization,\" the document recommended Zahn saying, \"If what you're saying is, I’m going to put a ‘for sale’ sign in front of JEA tomorrow — the answer is no.\"\n\nThe answer was yes.\n\nTo damage JEA's reputation and make the prospect of a sale seem more enticing, the utility sent mailers to customers with misleading claims designed to confuse them, claiming, for example, that over the past 10 years, \"JEA raised customer rates by 71 percent.\" This was a clever obfuscation that side-stepped the fact that actual customer bills had declined over that same period; like so much else during Zahn's tenure, it was trickery.\n\nIt would take years of reporting and investigation by a City Council committee to learn that Zahn had in fact held secret, off-site planning meetings with bankers, lawyers and others where the privatization push had been orchestrated even before the board had given him authorization. Some of these firms were hired without signed contracts, which kept the work off the books until it was too late to do anything about it.\n\nAnd contrary to the normal way things were done, the federal indictment alleges, Zahn prevented employees from uploading the board's July 23 agenda to JEA's website ahead of the meeting, which also had the effect of keeping the public in the dark about what was about to happen. That finding by the grand jury is backed up by internal text messages among utility officials, who acknowledged receiving a public-records request a week prior from the newspaper for the presentation Zahn and his team were planning to give; they never turned it over.\n\n\" ... remember, we're just stalling,\" one communications employee wrote. \"So long as we get to Tuesday it really doesn't matter. Fingers crossed!\"\n\nTheir ruse worked, at least in the short term.\n\n“If you’d been paying attention, you’d have seen the historic moment coming,\" Alan Howard, a JEA board member, astonishingly declared that day.\n\nV. Curry's support\n\nCurry stepped in for Zahn at key moments, vouching for and defending his ally. He adopted Zahn's gobbledygook soothsaying about JEA's future and echoed Zahn's insistence the very explicit effort to privatize the agency — occurring in plain view — was merely an \"exploration.\"\n\n“He’s the CEO of an incredibly large utility who’s got an incredibly important job. He’s led through an incredibly challenging year and has been attacked viciously, unfairly by some,\" Curry once told Florida Politics.\n\n“Maybe it’s a new way of thinking for an organization like JEA,” he added. “But it’s pretty common in business.”\n\nSome of Curry's fiercest critics are frustrated the mayor is not named in the indictment; this both underestimates the difficulty of going after public corruption — even this more narrow case is remarkable for traditionally risk-averse federal prosecutors to pursue — and misreads the indictment itself.\n\nHe may not be mentioned by name, but Curry is sullied by the facts presented.\n\nProsecutors, for example, went out of their way to note Zahn's lack of experience prior to winning the CEO job, another statement that was not central to the criminal case but nonetheless tips the government's hand about how it views the way Zahn got the job.\n\nMost significantly, the indictment is explicit about this: The pretext Zahn provided the board and the public to win authorization to sell JEA was a fraud. And it was that very pretext Curry supported, defended, and, when Zahn was placed on administrative leave as controversies around him mounted, tried to finish.\n\nTime itself has given lie to Zahn's doom-and-gloom wishcasting. Nearly three years into the projections he gave the board, little of what he predicted is happening. JEA's workforce has slightly grown; electric sales were a tad higher than expected. The pressure on JEA's rates — rising fuel costs — played no role in Zahn's gloom-and-doom predictions.\n\nJEA is simply not in a \"death spiral.\"\n\nBut lying to the public is not a crime, and so Curry skates on his most obvious misdeed.\n\nWhat did he know of the facts surrounding the criminal charges? Did Curry know about the secret bonus plan Zahn and Wannemacher, the CFO, are alleged to have dreamed up?\n\nOver the course of several years of reporting, I have never come across evidence, including on-and-off record discussions with city and utility officials and others, that provided any convincing reason to think he did.\n\nVI. \"The savior of JEA\"\n\nJEA's value belongs to everyone and no one: It is the result of all of us paying into it, and the stewardship of generations of employees who work there. My own view, shared by some who worked with him at JEA, is that Zahn — incorrectly — came to believe he was responsible for that value and was thus entitled to a piece of it, and so he sought to warp JEA's value into an investment vehicle he could covert into cold hard cash.\n\nProsecutors found evidence he and Wannemacher had been scheming to do this as early as March 2019, months before he had fully fleshed out his pretext to sell JEA.\n\nA defense I expect Zahn and Wannemacher to claim, should they take this to trial, is that there was, ultimately, no theft — their plot was foiled by City Council Auditors, city attorneys, council members and public pressure. The system worked, their lawyers might argue: An admittedly bad idea never came to fruition.\n\nExcept it did. Zahn and Wannemacher are accused of lying to the board of directors to win their authorization to implement the plan. Although they later tried to characterize that vote as something more akin to an initial greenlighting of a concept they were still working on, the resolution the board passed made it clear this was a final approval — language prosecutors note in the criminal indictment.\n\nAnd if, as prosecutors allege, the entire sales campaign was based on fraud — designed to further their scheme to get rich quick — then there was in fact considerable loss to ratepayers. A final accounting of the costs related to privatization is difficult to total authoritatively, in part because of some accounting games the executives played when budgeting for it, but it's near $20 million, if not substantially more.\n\nThere were also the difficult-to-calculate costs of the downgrade to JEA's credit rating — the result of a foolish, no-shot lawsuit Zahn initiated to attempt to weasel out of an unbreakable contractual obligation to help build two nuclear reactors in Georgia — and the destruction of JEA's reputation among its peers.\n\nAnd of course there was the loss of time: Time for JEA to plan for its actual, real-life challenges; time this city had to debate worthy issues; time the utility's employees lost worrying about their future.\n\nZahn often seemed to resent the public scrutiny he received, but he deliberately turned himself into one of the city's most visible public officials — not just by pursuing a divisive policy like privatization, but by other campaigns, too, like shelling out $300,000 in ratepayer money for a multi-day conference on innovation in which he was a key speaker.\n\nEmployees have told my colleagues and me over the years Zahn reacted with both hurt and anger that he was never able to win over JEA's workforce. But what precisely did he expect?\n\nOften, the most gullible recipient of his lies seemed to be Zahn himself.\n\nIn one sworn interview with a former JEA executive, lawyers investigating Zahn's tenure asked a question I and others often wondered during the tumultuous days of his reign: What did Zahn want people to think of him?\n\n“That he deserved the job, that he was going to lead JEA into the future if people just understood everything we were doing at JEA, that they would understand he was leading us into this path of the future and that it was solely him that was doing so and that he had come in to be the savior of JEA,” the executive said.\n\n“ … he felt like if we were good at our jobs … people would pay attention to this amazing path he was leading us down and people would pay attention to him, and people would see the promise of JEA and Aaron Zahn.”\n\nNate Monroe is a metro columnist whose work regularly appears every Thursday and Sunday.

The trend is coast-long, even in places where the strategy had been to allow nature to take its course.\n\nDelaware alone received $30 million in federal Sandy relief money to restore sand that was swept away during the hurricane in 2012. Another $38 million is being spent at Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge to restore wetlands and fill shoreline breaches that Sandy worsened.\n\nThe sand pumping there – in an area that federal officials had allowed to retreat as sand washed over into the adjacent marsh during storms – started last week.\n\nBut this new policy could be short-lived, said Howard Marlowe, with Warwick Group Consultants, a Washington-based consulting firm. Marlowe is an expert on beach rehabilitation funding, having lobbied on behalf of communities for several years. He has shifted his focus to a regional approach to shoreline management and to finding new sources of sand such as reuse of dredge spoils.\n\nHis predicts that when it comes time for maintenance and repairs of all these created beaches, there won't be enough federal money to go around.\n\n\"They'll be bumping into each other,\" he said of state and local governments who will be jockeying for a share of federal money. \"There's going to be a load of beaches between 2017 and 2020\" that will need maintenance and repairs – and that's without a significant storm or hurricane. \"There's going to be a significant lack of money if I had to bet on it.\"\n\nThat puts Delaware communities like Bethany and South Bethany – where as much of one-third of the protective sand dune was chopped off during a long-duration coastal storm earlier in October – in a predicament. The two communities are in line for federal maintenance sand pumping in 2017.\n\nAnthony P. Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway manager, said he isn't worried about availability of federal money for the Delaware projects. In each case, there is a 50-year contract for continued U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintenance.\n\n\"It really hasn't changed our world, at all,\" he said. All the projects that were initiated after Sandy were pre-approved, Pratt said.\n\nMarlowe has witnessed the struggle over money for beaches. He said it dates back to the Clinton administration, and the start of funding cuts for federal dollars for beach rehabilitation. Back then, there were fewer beaches in line for money. Among them: several in New Jersey, Florida and Ocean City, Maryland. These days – after emergency projects following Sandy – that funding pot may not be large enough to cover all the future repair needs.\n\nThe root of the problem, Marlowe said, is there isn't a federal coastal policy on beach renourishment. So while federal flood insurance may give people an incentive to build higher or farther from the sea, exactly where and how people build is controlled by local rules.\n\nHe believes states should work together on a regional basis to prioritize shoreline repair needs, reduce the cost of mobilizing dredge crews ( that mobilization cost can be significant) and work with federal agencies to find and use sand being removed as part of other projects.\n\nPratt said that before Sandy, officials in Delaware, Maryland, New York and New Jersey had started to work together but the effort was put on hold after the hurricane.\n\nThe idea, he said, was to find ways to make beach repairs more efficient by combining contracts to reduce overall costs.\n\nFowler Beach Fix\n\nAt Fowler Beach, there is a one-time effort to build a more storm resilient wetland and shoreline. Even before Sandy, lower Delaware Bay residents begged federal officials to fill the breaches along the bay shoreline.\n\n\"At first, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThree years after Sandy, the Fowler Beach sand pumping project is the largest of the Delaware shoreline repair projects. The plan is to pump 1.1 million cubic yards of sand to fill a series of breaches and inlets blamed for flooding in nearby communities, killing trees in adjacent woods and flooding nearby farm fields with salt water. The repeated inundation prompted farmers to build earthen berms to keep the flood waters out.\n\nLast week, a survey boat made a final series of calculations and then a plug in the pipeline was removed. The pipe was primed with seawater and then, on Oct. 21, the first of the sand that will be pumped onto Fowler Beach, spilled through the pipeline. The area is southeast of Milford and is currently inaccessible. The road is closed while the dredging work is underway. Eventually, federal refuge officials may install a footpath into the restored area.\n\n\"In the beginning, it was a battle,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association, of the push by area residents, farmers and landowners to get federal officials to address the problem. \"Now it's a cooperative effort.\"\n\nThe plan, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, is to work north first and then shift to the south to fill the largest in a series of breaches between Fowler and Prime Hook beaches.\n\nWhile the Fowler Beach breach opened during previous storms – the first was in 2008 – it was worsened during Sandy. Today, it is more an inlet than a breach, sending water into and out of the marsh with every high and low tide on Delaware Bay.\n\n\"We have the Prime Hook Sound,\" now, Bailey said.\n\nOnce the breach formed, water flooded a manmade water holding structure originally designed to draw in ducks and geese during migration each fall. The area became a rich habitat for ducks that favored fresh and brackish water.\n\nBut once the shoreline was breached, the old structure flooded with water from Delaware Bay, the freshwater vegetation died and the structure of the marsh crumbled. In storms, saltwater followed the old drainage ditch system and flooded low-lying farm fields adjacent to the refuge. The salty water limited the crops that would grow.\n\nBailey said this restoration project will help property owners to the north in Slaughter Beach, to the south in Prime Hook and Broadkill beaches and also help area farmers.\n\nThe $38 million cost includes shifting drainage in several of the refuge marsh units to restore historic channels and allow the marshes to revert back to historic, tidal salt and brackish marshes. Federal officials believe that will make the marsh system more resilient during coastal storms and improve drainage. Salt tolerant grasses will be planted to help the wetlands built and keep pace with sea level.\n\nOne of the landmarks in the area – the foundation of a tower that dated back to WWII – now sits several feet offshore in deep water. It will be covered in sand, said Bart Wilson, the project manager for the federal agency.\n\nThe plan is to create a 220-foot-wide beach in the area, with a 40-foot wide dune that will taper into the adjacent marsh to the west. The dune will be 9-feet above mean sea level, said Al Rizzo, The Fish & Wildlife Service Coastal Delaware project leader for Bombay Hook and Prime Hook national wildlife refuges. The dune height is based on remnant dunes in the area, he said.\n\n\"We're crossing our fingers and praying we don't get a nor'easter or hurricane in the next five years,\" Rizzo said.\n\nThat will give thousands of sprigs of beach grass time to establish on the manmade dune and build resiliency.\n\nThe dune will taper into the adjacent marsh.\n\nThe area is one of the most dynamic along Delaware's coast. The remains of a bird viewing platform constructed less than a decade ago behind the dune, are now in deep water just off the beach. A series of studies found that manipulation of the area marsh over the last several decades kept it from keeping pace with sea level rise. Many of Delaware's coastal marshes are keeping pace with sea level rise by adding fractions of inches of decomposing plant matter year after year. Those marshes retreat naturally as waves cause the sand to over wash into the wetland and form a new beach just to the west. That didn't happen at Fowler Beach because the adjacent marsh flooded, the plants died and deep inlets were cut over the last several years. Rather than a beach, a mucky layer of exposed peat edged the shoreline.\n\nHurricane Sandy worsened the damage that had already occurred.\n\nThis massive marsh and beach restoration is designed as a demonstration project on coastal and marsh resilience in a refuge system. It is also designed to protect and restore thousands of acres of habitat at the refuge.\n\nRizzo said the project took two years to design, using sophisticated modeling to guide the marsh drainage work. Earlier this summer, crews started work on a plan to improve the drainage in the marsh system by clearing sand from the network of historic drainage channels.\n\nThe beach repairs could be completed as early as this spring with all of the work finished by October 2016, Wilson said.\n\nRizzo said the sand pumping contract is $14 million. Additional money will be spent to plant the rebuilt dune. The total project cost is $38 million from federal Sandy relief money.\n\nOther repair sites\n\nDelaware's other major Sandy repair projects are mostly complete, save for work on projects at two state wildlife refuges in Kent County.\n\nOne of the most iconic images after Hurricane Sandy in Delaware was of the damage at the north side of Indian River Inlet bridge. There, the approach road from the old bridge was destroyed by waves and storm surge – confirming the long-held fear that the old bridge was vulnerable and a new one needed.\n\nSince Sandy, both the approach road and the old bridge have been removed. State transportation contractors removed thousands of cubic yards of sand from the roadway and used it to rebuild the storm-flattened dune. In addition, they pounded steel-sheeting into the sand just east of the roadway to protect it from future storm damage. More sand was pumped from a bar in the inlet onto the north inlet beach to create a wider buffer for the new bridge approach road.\n\nElsewhere along the ocean coast, sand was pumped in to replace the losses at Rehoboth and Dewey beaches, Bethany and South Bethany and Fenwick Island. Total cost: $30 million.\n\nThe state received an additional $6.9 million for habitat restoration along the Delaware Bayshore.\n\nAt Mispillion Harbor, where the plan is to rebuild shorebird and horseshoe crab habitat by creating more sandy beach, state officials are ready to apply for state and federal permits.\n\n\"The whole point is to improve habitat for spawning horseshoe crabs and red knot\" shorebirds, said Karen Bennett, who administers the state's Delaware Bayshore initiative.\n\nThe existing rock wall at Mispillion Harbor will be raised three-feet higher than it is now to keep waves and storm high tides from topping it. An area that has breached in the past will be angled into an existing sand dune to prevent future breaching.\n\nThe idea is to recreate the habitat in the area as it looked in the 1940s and '50s, said Jeremey Ashe, the restoration project manager.\n\nSmall structures perpendicular to the rock wall will be built to help hold the sand in place, he said. The two final parts of the Mispillion project will be to fill an old ditch to create a tidal marsh and try a small, experimental project to create about two acres of shorebird roosting habitat in the old Fitzgerald Marsh to the west of the harbor.\n\nTo the north, at Milford Neck, the state, The Nature Conservancy and Delaware Wild Lands are working together to come up with a plan to restore the marsh to a more natural drainage system. Like most tidal wetlands in Delaware, the marshes at Milford Neck were cut with ditches to drain them and reduce mosquito populations.\n\nBennett said state officials know that coastal storms and flooding are inevitable so the idea with this project is to restore drainage so when flooding does happen, the water doesn't inundate the western edge of the marsh – the buffer between the marsh and the uplands. When that happens, saltwater kills the trees and vegetation, she said.\n\nAt the Ted Harvey State Wildlife Area east of Dover, state officials are planning a restoration of the existing impoundment, a manmade structure that holds water during times where birds are migrating through the area. The existing dike between the impoundment and Delaware Bay dates back to the 1960s, Ashe said.\n\nThe dike will be raised two to three feet to make it higher and less likely to be breached during coastal storms. A pumping system to raise and lower water levels will also be upgraded.\n\nAt Little Creek Wildlife Area, state officials are looking at how to make the impoundments there more storm resilient.The best strategy may be to create a buffer for future sea level rise but modeling work is still underway. The shoreline to the east is no longer a sandy beach and part of a restoration there, Ashe said, might eventually include restoration of a sand shoreline.\n\nAs a final state project, state wildlife officials are working with the state Department of Transportation to restore Port Mahon Road. The road ends at a boat launch ramp and parking lot but is especially vulnerable to storm and flood damage.\n\nFederal money to replace lost sand\n\nFor beaches alone, this breakdown of federal spending to replace sand losses from Sandy:\n\n509,000 cubic yards at Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach -- $9,172,794\n\n440,000 cubic yards at the north side of Indian River Inlet -- $6.6 million\n\n536,000 cubic yards at Bethany-South Bethany -- $7,832,731\n\n368,000 cubic yards at Fenwick Island -- $4,319,254\n\n22,000 cubic yards along the Delaware Bay at Lewes -- $752,420\n\nSource: Army Corps of Engineers\n\nReach Molly Murray at 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

For the past decade, the waterway has become a graveyard for seagrass: the place where it just dies.\n\nRhizomes, or the seagrass roots that enable it to spread and grow, drift along Brevard's lagoon bottom and perish quickly before they can take root in the sand. Science blames the nutrient-rich output from septic tanks, sewage spills, fertilizer free-for-alls, and willy-nilly paving over wetlands as the killers.\n\nNevertheless, a few companies, nonprofits and government agencies believe there might be an extraordinarily, seemingly simple solution to the problem. The idea is to just grow the grasses in large tanks on land and then transplant them into the lagoon to nurse it back to health.\n\nBut biologists say its anything but simple and straightforward. And some critics of the concept see it a costly waste of time, the equivalent of throwing good money into bad water at the expense of more tried-and-true restoration methods. They say that until we get a grasp on exactly why the seagrass can't re-establish itself in the lagoon, the idea of simply trying to regrow seagrass in the estuary is futile.\n\nSeagrass sprouting:Sebastian Inlet sprouts hope for Florida manatees and other Indian River Lagoon life\n\nIndeed, there are many unknowns in the effort. Is it possible to harvest enough of the scant remaining lagoon grass, nurture it in special nurseries, then simply transplant it back to the river to reestablish the thousands of acres of lost beds. Or would poor water quality quickly kill off all the transplants? Or would starving sea cows eat up all the newly sprouting blades overnight?\n\nSome of the answers might emerge from what's just been submerged in Palm Bay.\n\nIn tributaries there and several other places around Florida, a few companies are placing big bets they can nurse back one of nature's foundational foodstuffs for fish, manatees and other lagoon life.\n\nPalm Bay dredging leads to odor:Stinky seaweed befouls Palm Bay neighborhood\n\nA handful of companies, including Sea & Shoreline, LLC, which is conducting the Palm Bay plantings, have garnered the \"seed\" money of sorts from nonprofits, their own pockets and government agencies to try the high-risk ventures that promise huge potential ecological gains.\n\nA group of scientists, including some at FAU-Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute, who've been studying the lagoon for decades say planting seagrass may be worth a whirl. So they have embarked on a litany of planting efforts at sites throughout the lagoon.\n\nThe best-available science is mixed, with more promising results in recent years. Maybe the fittest grass could be planted in the harshest waters, as has happened with clams. Or if cages protect the planted grass long enough and water quality improves, the grass will last. Either way, biologists are giving it a try. And that helps keep conservationists who care about manatees and other lagoon life from feeling so helpless.\n\n\"Over time, they hopefully will provide a food source for manatees,\" Ryan Brushwood, senior biologist at Sea & Shoreline, said during his company's recent seagrass planting in Turkey Creek and nearby Goat Creek.\n\nBrushwood and other seagrass restorers are in constant search of clearer waters, better substrate and more private and public funding. Now, taxpayer and donated money promises to help bring back to life the fish, manatees and other seagrass-dependent marine life that lured many to the Indian River Lagoon region when it was much healthier many years ago.\n\nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, Brevard Zoo, Sebastian Inlet District and companies such as Sea & Shoreline, Atkins, and Aquatech Eco Consultants are convinced it can work. Time will tell.\n\nThe hope is a long-term food source for manatees. But that can't happen until the grass is stable enough to survive grazing pressure. So, researchers put cages around the planted grass to give it time to grow before hungry manatees, turtles, ducks or other creatures can gobble it back before the grass has a chance to take root.\n\n\"They won't pull them up, it will be a food source,” Brushwood said of manatees in the Palm Bay area, “and as they come into these tributaries, especially in the wintertime, they'll be something for them to munch on.\"\n\nBig donations and a lot of hope\n\nThis coming spring, S&S plans other plantings at other lagoon tributaries.\n\nThe project is funded by S&S and the nonprofit Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida. The foundation chipped in $35,000 for the $88,331 Turkey Creek project. The total for all six projects the foundation and S&S are partnering on is $409,991, with the Foundation covering $260,000 of those costs. The foundation also has several projects not with S&S.\n\nEarlier this year, the co-owner of the Boston Celtics made a $2 million donation toward helping the Florida manatee recover from its record die off last year in one of the largest gifts ever for the nonprofits working to save the state's most-iconic marine mammal.\n\nCeltics owner kicks in for seacows:Co-owner of Boston Celtics gives $2 million to save Florida manatees\n\nA record 1,101 manatees died last year, most of them in Brevard. Most died from starvation due to seagrass loss, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. That has moved many to act.\n\nIn May, the Fish & Wildlife Foundation announced that a family charity overseen by philanthropists Karen and Rob Hale would give $1 million gifts to the Foundation and to Save the Manatee Club. The former tapped that donation to pay for bolstering already planned seagrass restoration efforts. Save the Manatee Club planned to spend the money on the bigger-picture water quality problems that keep seagrass — the manatee's staple diet — from growing back.\n\nThe Florida Fish & Wildlife Foundation contracted with Aquatech for a project in Loxahatchee River and S&S for two plantings in Brevard.\n\nBrevard Zoo is involved in a few dozen sites throughout the lagoon where it plans in begin planting seagrass in the early spring. The zoo plans four seagrass nurseries, including one at the Hubbs-SeaWorld's property in Melbourne Beach. The zoo's first pilot seagrass planting project is expected to begin in spring 2023.\n\nThe zoo's projects are funded by private donors and the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program.\n\nOff the shoreline of Samsons Island in Satellite Beach, last year the city embarked on a \"habitat mosaic\" planting project of seagrass plantings, with 5,500 oyster shells modules and 80,000 \"live” clams, in what ultimately will be a $522,265 three-phase effort, with the cost split between the city, the Brevard's Tourist Development Council and the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program, with the city, project partners and community volunteers contributing more than half the cost and TDC and NEP paying almost half. The city's cost was staff time. The Florida Institute of Technology is analyzing the water quality throughout the project.\n\nThe average survivorship of the grass planted so far is about 55%, city officials said, and most seagrass plots have shown growth beyond the initial planting areas, about 31% of the clams survived, and the project grew almost 1,000 oysters onsite.\n\nAtkins North America also has embarked on experimental seagrass planting in the inlet area for Sebastian Inlet District in 2013 after mass seagrass die-off from large-scale algae blooms. The program was done in conjunction with the St. Johns River Water Management District and FAU-Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute. SJRWMD did plantings at locations in the northern lagoon and Banana River.\n\nThe sites have been doing well, said Don Deis, a scientist with Atkins.\n\nDo seagrass transplants work?\n\nDespite all the government and consultant assurances of early success, uncertainties remain about the prospects of long-term survival for planted seagrass.\n\nTransplanted 'super clams' thrive, sparking hope of cleansing gunked-up Indian River Lagoon\n\nSo far, studies show the upshot on seagrass planting seems to be:\n\nIt often lacks standardized ways to measure success\n\nThe ways it has been measured so far have shown about a third of the grass survives past a few years\n\nThere have been more promising results in recent years, but it's uncertain whether that's driven more by climate factors\n\nIt is expensive and time intensive, so the 'bang-for-the-ecological buck' remains uncertain\n\n\"Why is the seagrass dying in the first place?\" Grant Gilmore, a fisheries ecologist who's studied the lagoon for more than four decades, wrote in an email. Gilmore sees many factors besides nitrogen and phosphorus from sewage, fertilizers and other sources killing seagrass.\n\n\"This would include herbicides that kill native phytoplankton and allow exotic or deleterious phytoplankton to take over,\" Gilmore added. \"This could include cyanobacteria such as Microcystis. We also know that Roundup kills seagrass and is longer in toxicity in saline environments. Possibly the same for other herbicides commonly used locally.\"\n\nA 2019 study in Nature by the University of South Florida and FWC that said it, \"represents the largest and most comprehensive effort to revisit and evaluate historic seagrass restoration projects to date,\" noted that: \"Seagrass restoration has frequently been viewed as an unpredictable management strategy, often with poor results.\"\n\nThe survival rate has been estimated at 38% of plants based on literature analysis of past studies. The studies show loss of seagrass in the early stages of projects remains \"a major hurdle in seagrass restoration. But in contrast to the low initial survival rates previously reported, their study found long-term seagrass restoration persistence rates of almost 90%. The researchers visited 33 seagrass restorations in Florida ranging in age from 3 to 32 years to compare seagrass percent cover.\n\n\"Importantly, this study demonstrates that many of the seagrass restoration efforts initially deemed successful or trending toward success by Florida practitioners have created habitat capable of persisting for years to decades after management action,\" the researchers wrote.\n\n\"We conclude that seagrass restorations in Florida that persist unaided, do so as a result of sufficient planting efforts, appropriate site selection, and/or the use of adaptive management practices.\"\n\nWill manatees just munch up all the new grass?\n\nHundreds of manatees — sometimes more than a thousand — gather flipper-to-flipper each winter at the two lagoon-side power plants in Port St. John, keeping them farther north than they'd otherwise be. Before power plants, manatees seldom migrated farther north than Sebastian Inlet on the east coast and Charlotte Harbor on the west coast, biologists say. That puts them in areas with scant seagrass during cooler months.\n\nBecause of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the north Banana River has been closed to boating since 1963, making it a manatee mecca where sea cow numbers had ballooned to more than 1,200 manatees by 2014. But several severe algae blooms in the past decade killed off a majority of the seagrass manatees rely upon in the Banana River and elsewhere in the Indian River Lagoon system.\n\nManatee herds in some areas of the lagoon have been known to graze on and disturb up to 40% of the seagrass beds, research shows, removing 80% to 96% of the seagrass and 50% to 67% of the roots.\n\nOne 1991 study in the northern Banana River by an environmental consultant to NASA found manatees significantly reduced seagrass within just six weeks. But the manatees didn’t harm the grass long term and appeared to improve the diversity of seagrass species by creating openings within the grass beds, enabling the smaller species to sprout up.\n\nSomething else happened in the fenced-in areas: a species called manatee grass eventually out competed and replaced a seagrass species called shoal grass. Biologists say a healthy, diverse ecology requires a mix of different seagrass species, rather than just one type dominating the habitat.\n\nIn a year or two, the seagrass beds in the open plots grew back with the two co-dominant species of seagrass, which makes for more diverse, stable seagrass beds, the researchers said.\n\nNASA study:Researchers revive three-decade-old study on manatee, seagrass impacts\n\n'We're going to remain optimistic': New rays of hope and dollars shine on Florida manatees\n\nFeeding manatees: Florida mulls the unthinkable: feeding manatees in the wild\n\nCharles \"Chuck\" Jacoby, senior scientist at the St. Johns River Water Management District, sees seagrass planting as \"high risk, high reward.\"\n\n\"I think everyone agrees that in the long term that planting our way out of the situation, is a pretty high-risk effort,\" Jacoby said.\n\nSuccess rates will depend on rain levels, water clarity, salt content, he added.\n\n\"I don't think you would use it for your primary nutrient-reduction strategy,\" Jacoby said.\n\nDuane DeFreese, executive director of the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program, agrees. His program has helped to fund several seagrass planting projects in the lagoon and is helping to get the science right.\n\n\"The focus is and must continue to be improvement of water clarity and quality by reducing nutrient loads from all sources (wastewater, septic tanks, fertilizer, and muck) and managing freshwater inputs to the IRL (Indian River Lagoon),\" DeFreese said via email.\n\n\"No one believes that we will be able to plant our way out of this problem, but we may be able to accelerate the timeline for recovery,\" DeFreese said.\n\nJim Waymer is an environment reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.

Since 1988, when state officials jumped into the coastal pool as a beach renourishment player, millions more cubic yards of sand were pumped in, lost and restored.\n\nThe state paid its own way in this multi-million-dollar coastal gamble, one fueled by the uncertainty of the path of hurricanes and the relentless pounding from fall and winter nor'easters, until the first federal cost-share projects began in coastal towns in 2005.\n\nIt is a risk state officials have been willing to take, especially now with the federal government paying 65 percent of the cost. They argue lost sand is better than lost buildings, roads and lives and a wide beach fuels the state's multi-million tourism economy in an age where one storm like Sandy can cause a seismic shift in where vacationers plant their beach chairs each summer.\n\nDelaware coastline takes beating, but two beaches hold\n\nSnowstorm hurts Wilmington restaurants' profits\n\nAfter Sandy, Delaware resorts saw more tourists from New York and New Jersey than ever before, a trend that continues.\n\nAfter last weekend's coastal storm, Delaware's treasured ocean beaches are exposed again. And state officials find themselves in a familiar predicament: Figuring out how to rebuild the coastline to protect resort communities.\n\n\"We are coming upon a crossroads here in Delaware,\" said State Environmental Secretary David Small. \"Our local share is defined by state matching dollars. I'm not sure that that's a model even in the near term that is sustainable.\"\n\nLast weekend's storm was one of those rare coastal tipping points in Delaware. It hit with so much power, it reshaped shorelines from Pickering Beach along Delaware Bay south to Fenwick Island along the ocean. The cost of repairs may be too much for the state to handle given other infrastructure needs, Small said.\n\nIn some places along Delaware Bay, it was days after the storm before water levels subsided enough that state assessment crews could even gauge the impact. Some of the most extensive damage occurred on privately owned beaches where no state or federal help is available.\n\nAnthony P. Pratt, the state shoreline and waterway manager, said his office fielded calls all week from people in shore towns, public and private. They need help with everything from moving sand to clearing debris.\n\nState Sen. Ernie Lopez, R-Lewes, who represents coastal communities from Lewes south to Indian River Inlet, said he believes most Delawareans have no idea of \"the severe damage that was done.\"\n\nBesides the discussion on how to pay, there may be a more difficult question to discuss: When, and where, can we walk away and let nature take its course.\n\n\"This is where retreat comes in,\" said Orrin Pilkey, Professor Emeritus of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke University's Nicholas School of the Environment.\n\nMore than a decade ago, coastal geologist Stephen Leatherman, better known as \"Dr. Beach\" for his annual best beaches ranking, looked at the durability of renourished beaches. He found that 26 percent of renourished beaches disappear in less than a year; 62 percent last 2 to 5 years and 12 percent last more than 5 years. On average, he found a one- to three-year lifespan of renourished shorelines in Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey.\n\nPilkey, who has a new book on retreat coming out this spring, said there is an idea that a property is \"too big to flood,\" meaning that the more tall buildings and infrastructure you have along a shoreline, the harder it is to walk away.\n\n\"Once high-rises come in, there is nothing you can do,\" he said. How, he asked, can you retreat in a place like Fort Lauderdale or Miami Beach where there are high rises and hotels all along the shoreline.\n\n\"I fear that there is nothing that can be done,\" he said. \"But in Delaware, it's not hopeless like it is in Florida.\"\n\nLike Leatherman's research, Pilkey said there are significant problems with renourished beaches.\n\n\"They disappear much faster than natural beaches,\" he said. \"At least two times faster.\"\n\nAfter last weekend's storm, Bethany Beach surfer Jim McGrath said he feels like it's his right to say: \"I told you so.\"\n\nHe's warned everyone who would listen that \"when the right storm comes along, your dune is going to be gone in two hours.\"\n\nAnd that, he suggested, is what happened with this storm.\n\nThat $30 million in free sand from the Hurricane Sandy Relief money \"is basically gone in 24 hours,\" he said.\n\nHis contends that after Sandy, Delaware's ocean coast didn't really need the sand but \"they got $30 million bucks and it's all gone.\"\n\nThe reality, he said, is that sand pumping will continue in Delaware until \"somebody says: 'I ain't paying for it anymore.' \"\n\nIt was a depressing sight for the hundreds of visitors who drove into Rehoboth Beach Sunday, many with smart phones and tablets to chronicle the destruction. It was a beach many has never seen before – flat, no dune at the north end of the boardwalk, and waves lapping just feet from the boardwalk.\n\n\"It's sad,\" said Connie Tredinnick, who lives part time in Rehoboth Beach. \"There's no dune at all. That's the biggest devastation.\"\n\nYet Lopez and others considered the coastal communities lucky.\n\n\"Those dunes saved us,\" said Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View.\n\nDelaware officials have known they had a problem with eroding beaches for decades.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the Army Corps of Engineers looked at Delaware's ocean coast and identified problem areas such as the north side of Indian River Inlet. The plan was to strategically place sand on key areas of beach and allow it to migrate along the shoreline with the natural movement of sand.\n\nThat sand project never happened and then, the March Storm of 1962 hit. From North Carolina to New Jersey, dunes were flattened and houses were destroyed. Along the Delaware Coast, the ocean met the inland bays from Dewey Beach south to Fenwick Island. Delaware Bay overwashed the beach and every community from Woodland Beach south was flooded. Six people died in Kent County when they were caught in the storm surge of rapidly rising waters.\n\nBy the numbers, the Jan. 22-23 storm brought a slightly higher, high tide at Lewes Breakwater Harbor if the preliminary data holds. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge at Lewes Break water Harbor measured a peak high tide Saturday morning, Jan. 23 of 9.23 feet. The peak during the March Storm there was 9.2.\n\nFor many, this coastal damage was the worst they have ever seen but for lifelong residents like Hocker and Rehoboth Beach Mayor Samuel Cooper, it is hard to believe the tide bested 1962. The damage then – from homes washed away and crushed, to flooding to vast expanses of sand filling cottages -- is etched in the collective memories of Delawareans who remember the storm.\n\nCooper recalled the story the late Virdin Marshall told of going to sleep at his home off Old Landing Road thinking everything would be fine and waking up to 30 inches of water in the first floor of his home.\n\n\"I remember talking to Phil Short,\" the late south coastal real estate developer who was living at a home he built on the bayside at Cotton Patch Hills north of Bethany Beach.\n\nCooper said Short told him he was out on the highway now known as Del. 1 up to his chest in flood waters.\n\n\"I find it hard to believe\" that the tide was as high in this storm, Cooper said. March 1962 went on for three days, he recalled.\n\nAs to this storm, \"If Sunday would have been like Saturday, it would have been a whole different picture\" with much, much worse damage.\n\nHocker was a junior high school student at the time and he remembers the flooding at his grandparents home. It stood on the land where the Catholic Church parsonage is today. There were four steps up to get to the house, he said.\n\nBut during the March Storm of 1962, there was water on the first floor of that house, about three miles west of the ocean at Bethany Beach.\n\n\"This was nothing like '62,\" he said.\n\nAs the tide rose Saturday in Lewes, the gauge at Breakwater Harbor temporarily stopped recording. But there was a second gauge that continued collecting the data, said Rich Edwing, head of the NOAA Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services. Edwing is in charge of all of NOAA's coastal tide gauges.\n\nEdwing said sea level is higher now at Lewes and that could be a factor. During 1962, water levels would have started at a lower point.\n\nIt turns out, water levels at the harbor would have been between 5 and 6 inches lower than they are today, based on a 3 millimeter annual rise in sea level at the location.\n\nOver time, all the gauges are re-calibrated to reflect sea level rise, he said.\n\nSo while the height of the tide above mean low water – the number typically used to track tides over time -- was slightly higher on January 23 than in March 1962, the tide level above mean sea level was lower.\n\nIn March 1962, the highest tide was 7.9 feet above mean sea level. With this storm, it was 7.037 feet above mean sea level.\n\nAnd there were likely other factors.\n\nDelaware's beaches from Lewes to Fenwick Island weren't as robust going into the 1962 storm as they were with this storm. Rehoboth and Bethany Beach, for instance, didn't have substantial sand dunes in 1962. The duration of the 1962 storm – which lasted through five extreme high tides -- was likely a factor, too.\n\nThe 1962 storm was a tipping point in state beach management. After the storm, Delaware officials – beaches were then managed by the state Highway Department – pumped sand from Rehoboth Bay to restore some beaches and trucked in sand to others. It was the state's first big effort to restore storm-damaged beaches.\n\nOver time, there were small projects here and there, especially along Delaware Bay.\n\nIs there enough sand to go around?\n\nBut the next big tipping point came with Hurricane Gloria in 1985. The storm brushed past the coast of Delaware some 35 miles east of Bethany Beach. It destroyed the boardwalks in Rehoboth and Bethany and depleted the ocean shoreline.\n\nEvery little storm that followed, increased the vulnerabilities at towns like Dewey Beach and South Bethany.\n\nIn South Bethany, waves routinely crashed under houses and repeatedly washed out Ocean Drive along with the water and sewer connections.\n\nIn Dewey Beach, the surf crashed against hotels.\n\nIn 1988-89, the state pumped $4.5 million worth of sand onto beaches from Fenwick Island to Bethany Beach. Middlesex Beach and Sea Colony piggy-backed the state-funded dredge project and paid for more sand for the two private communities.\n\nThen, came another tipping point. The January nor'easter of 1992. Again, boardwalks in Bethany Beach and Rehoboth were badly damaged.\n\nThe summer of 1992, the state paid to pump more sand – some $2.66 million to pump sand in the same area.\n\nMore sand came in 1994 and Dewey Beach got its first transfusion of pumped sand at a cost of $2.4 million.\n\nBy then, state officials, guided by then Gov. Michael Castle's Beaches 2000 report, had concluded that beach renourishment was worth the cost. That report also suggested that Sussex County and the municipalities should contribute to the cost of the shoreline repairs.\n\nDewey Beach set up a beach renourishment fund which now totals over $3.6 million. Neither the county nor the other municipalities created a dedicated way for beach repairs.\n\nGordons Pond trail damaged, to close for repairs\n\nIn the meantime, state lawmakers set an 8 percent accommodations tax. Part was to go to tourism development in the three counties and the rest to fund beach renourishment.\n\nPratt paints of bleak picture of what would have happened had the state not done something back then.\n\nOn average, Delaware's ocean beaches erode at a rate of 2 to 3 feet a year.\n\nCooper recalls walking down the boardwalk in the pre-renourish days and seeing people with their towels on the boardwalk because there just wasn't room on the beach for them at the north end of the city.\n\nWithout the addition of sand, there would be very little beach today at Rehoboth, Pratt said. He pictures a downward economic spiral of fewer and fewer tourists, less reinvestment in the community and a scenario he liken to a depressed Atlantic City or Miami Beach.\n\nWithout sand and a beach \"it would be an impoverished Rehoboth Beach,\" he said.\n\nAnd there would be a cascading effect all along the ocean coast.\n\n\"The basis of tourism is gone,\" Pratt said. \"We see an economic decline.\"\n\nAnd people who used to spend $300 a night or more for a stay in an ocean front hotel in Rehoboth during the peak season spend less, way less without a beach, he said.\n\n\"That's the scary scenario,\" Pratt said.\n\nIn the end, the beach is what draws millions of tourists to Delaware each year and billions of dollars in spending and investment.\n\n\"Just think about the secondary and tertiary impacts of that,\" Small said.\n\nAnd think about this storm. Without sand, a place like South Bethany would have had almost no beach or dune left because with \"this same storm 13 years ago, we would be talking about half of Ocean Drive gone,\" Pratt said.\n\nThis time, there was one area where the dune was washed away and many other places where the ocean waves chopped better that half of it off. There is a step drop to the beach now but there is still a beach.\n\nDelaware winter storms\n\nFive days before it started snowing in Lewes, forecasters with the National Weather Service began watching a storm system brewing in the Ohio Valley. The monster snow storms of the Mid-Atlantic typically form there or in the Gulf of Mexico. It looked like a big snow was possible but it was days away. Forecasting snow is notoriously difficult in the region because a matter of miles can mean the difference between a dusting and a disaster.\n\nAs the week went on, something interesting happened. Forecasters use models to develop their weather predictions.And those models all pointed to the same conclusion: A major snow storm was headed to the MidAtlantic.\n\nLouis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service, hosted a press briefing Thursday, January 22. Uccellini and colleague Paul Kocin are experts on Atlantic Coast winter storms and developed a ranking system for them similar to the Saffir-Simpson Scale used to rank hurricanes. Uccellini described this one as \"a potentially paralyzing storm. . . It's not just snow we need to pay attention to,\" he warned. \"This is a multi-faceted storm.'\n\nWeather service forecasters reached out to local officials and emergency planners. Among their concerns: high tides, flooding, strong winds and coastal erosion. Along the Delaware and Maryland coast, snow would fall, switch to rain and be accompanied by strong north and northeast winds. The strength would be great as an intense low pressure system off the coast of North Carolina collided with high pressure over Eastern Canada. The collision between warm, moist air and arctic cold would form gale force winds and near hurricane force gusts along the coast.\n\nBy noon on Saturday, tides along the Delaware Bay coast were high -- so high that at Lewes, it cracked the record high tide of 9.2 feet set during the March Storm of 1962. Preliminary data measured the highest tide at 9.232 feet. A peak gust there topped 67 miles per hour with sustained winds of 40 to 50 miles per hour during the worst of the storm. roofing shingles and siding blew off houses, limbs and branches snapped. Lewes Mayor Ted Becker went out early Saturday morning to check water levels along the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal.\n\n\"I'm a big guy,\" he said. But the wind was so strong, he said, he could hardly walk.\n\nThe inches of snow that fell in Lewes before switching to rain early Saturday morning blew and drifted and on the beach turned into a tan mixture of drifting snow and sand. The municipal parking lot was covered in so much sand, it was impassable and took crews using heavy equipment to plow it and move it back to the beach. Power went out. By the morning high tide, the water in Lewes & Rehoboth Canal rose and rose, flooding Canal Front Park, and many of the city streets on the beach. Cedar Avenue.\n\nPreston Lee decided it was time to leave when the lower, garage area of his elevated home on Delmar Avenue near the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal on the beach side of Lewes began to fill with water.\n\n\"There were 30 inches of water in our lower level, he said. \"Our front yard is elevation 4\" feet above sea level.\n\nTo put that in perspective, Lee said, that during Hurricane Sandy, the water in the lower level rose to 22 inches.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rehoboth Beach, enormous ocean waves slammed the beach.\n\nAs the beach area struggled with wind, flooding and each erosion, the rest of the state coped with snow -- in some areas more than a foot of snow.\n\nIn the National Weather Service's ranking of winter storms, this one was a category 4, \"crippling,\" and the fourth worst the region had ever seen. The only thing worse: a category 5 There have been two of those storms in the Northeast:extreme snow events in February 1969 and March 1993.\n\nWhile much of Delaware shoveled snow, coastal communities assessed the destruction.\n\nOver the course of 24 hours from Saturday, Jan. 23 through Sunday morning Jan. 24, much of the millions of cubic yards of sand restored in 2013 with federal dollars from the Hurricane Sandy relief initiative and the dues that had been created through a decade of previous beach restoration work were destroyed or badly damaged.\n\nOnce again, Delaware is at a tipping point and the debate will likely revolve around the cost of beach repairs and whether there are some places along the shoreline where retreat is a viable option.\n\n\"The ocean coast line is a gold coast for Delaware,\" Small said. \"The value of that area continues to grow.\" And he said that tourism driver – along with the influx of more and more retirees and the housing market they support – continues to grow and is driven by access to the beach.\n\nBut, he said, some places along the Delaware Bay shore are less driven by tourism than by the ecological value.\n\nSmall said the idea of retreat from some of the most vulnerable areas along the Delaware Bayshore is a difficult discussion because for many, it is their beach and their home.\n\nBut he said, \"it's time to have this conversation\" both about where to invest and how to pay for it.\n\nThe damage at Rehoboth Beach alone is far more extensive than the typical routine beach maintenance that was envisioned with the 50-year beach renourishment projects that Delaware officials signed up for. And there is extensive damage to the south where the next round of repairs are set for 2017.\n\nRehoboth and Dewey beaches are up for routine federal maintenance this year. And as part of that, if the federal dollars are available, the state will pay 35 percent of the costs.\n\n\"We will be pressed in the near term to met our federal obligation,\" Small said.\n\nIn Bethany Beach, Mayor Jack Gordon is hoping to piggyback the Rehoboth-Dewey project and get sand to hold them over and restore the losses there.\n\nAn October nor'easter chopped away about half of the dune there. This storm left about one-third of what remained at the north end of town and washed it all away at the south end.\n\nGordon is just hoping the community can get through this winter and spring without another nor'easter.\n\n\"We certainly need some renourishment here,\" he said.\n\nOn one topic, everyone agrees. Right now, the Delaware Coastline. All of it is extremely vulnerable.\n\nThe cost of mobilizing dredge crews and pumping sand has risen as more and more coastal communities from New York to Florida have signed on to sand pumping as a way to hold back sea level rise and routine coastal erosion.\n\nAt Broadkill Beach, where the new dune and beach survived the storm, the project was delayed by more than a year because there wasn't a dredge company willing to bid on the job.\n\nWith more work, and more options for dredge operators, the cost is likely to continue to rise.\n\nSen. Tom Carper, D-Del., said the money for periodic repair at Dewey and Rehoboth has already been budgeted and shouldn’t be a problem this year.\n\nBut he warned that “the demand for Army Corps work and support exceeds” what is available.\n\nAnd from the damage he saw along the Delaware coast after this storm, he said “these are not going to be small amounts of money” for the upcoming periodic renourishment needs in Rehoboth and Dewey beaches.\n\nCarper is a believer in beach renourishment.\n\n\"We were all saddened to see the dunes eroded,\" he said, \"But those dunes did their job. They protected the towns.\"\n\nThere was, he said, no loss of roads or buildings because the dunes were there. And some of that missing sand is just off the beach and once it starts moving back in, state crews will be able to move it and build some type of dune protection.\n\nThat said, Carper is also a realist.\n\nWith beach renourishment, \"we are addressing a symptoms of the problem,\" he said. \"That's not a good situation.\"\n\nThe underlying cause of shoreline loss is sea level rise, he said.\n\nThat bigger problem is something people need to never forget and policies need to be in place to address it, he said.\n\nLopez said that the discussion about who pays and how much needs to include local officials and not be a discussion that just takes place at a state level.\n\nSmall said that he and his staff, prior to the storm, started talking to some local officials about a local contribution to beach renourishment.\n\nBut just as money is in short supply at a state level, so it is at a federal one.\n\nCooper said that at League of Local Government meetings there has been discussion about municipalities charging an accommodations tax on top of the state's 8-percent.\n\nDewey Beach charges a 3-percent tax but it only applies to rentals and not hotel and motel rooms, said Mayor Diane Hanson.\n\nIn some tourist areas like Dade County in Florida, the accommodations tax adds 13 percent to the cost of a motel room.\n\nSuch a local tax might be one way municipalities could come up with their share of a beach repair fund, Small said.\n\nAnd for the last few years, there has been talk in Legislative Hall of a short-term accommodations tax for coastal rentals, said F. Gary Simpson, R-Milford, who represents several Delaware Bay communities.\n\nThe idea would be to target the folks who rent beach houses and cottages, he said,\n\n\"I think it's a viable source of revenue,\" he said.\n\nAfter this storm, Small said, there needs to be a statewide conversion on beach funding.\n\n\"One conversation is about a local share,\" he said. \"The other part of the conversation is about a state share.\"\n\nBut perhaps the most difficult conversation will be where to continue to renourish and where to walk away, he said.\n\nSmall didn't mention any specific places where costs of renourishment might outweigh benefits. That is, he said, difficult to assess because of the many ecological benefits along the Delaware Bay.\n\nBut the simple fact is, that along the Delaware Bayshore, the tourism drivers aren't the same as along the ocean coast, he said.\n\n\"That's a reality,\" Small said. \"But it's also a reality those are people's homes.\"\n\nReach Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

Reed said the two-month process leading to the vote showed that he was wrong to tell companies how far the city has come. If the vote failed, he said, he would be forced to tell businesses that value diversity and inclusiveness that “maybe this isn’t the place for that project because I can’t stand behind it. Maybe this isn’t the place for what your employees are looking for because I can’t tell you in good faith that this city ... shares your values and your vision.” He also threatened to give Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin’s cellphone number to those businesses. Birmingham’s council passed a similar ordinance in 2017. “They’ve learned from their mistakes,” Reed said. Councilwoman Audrey Graham, who voted against the Montgomery ordinance, asked Reed if he’s serious about that threat. He responded: “Those individuals that ask me an honest question, then I’m going to give them an honest answer.” The ordinance would have made it illegal to discriminate against a range of groups in the areas of public accommodation, housing and employment, as well as in all city practices, including contracting.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal judge on Wednesday threw out Trump administration approvals for a large planned oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, saying the federal review was flawed and didn’t include mitigation measures for polar bears. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage vacated permits for ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in a 110-page ruling. The Trump administration approved the project in late 2020, and the Biden administration defended the project in court. Rebecca Boys, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson, said the company would review Gleason’s decision “and evaluate the options available regarding this project.” Spokespersons for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department said their agencies had no comment. The Bureau of Land Management conducted the environmental review of the project that Gleason found flawed. Conservation groups and Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, described as a grassroots organization, had challenged the adequacy of the review process. Karlin Itchoak, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society, in a statement called the ruling “a step toward protecting public lands and the people who would be most negatively impacted by the BLM’s haphazard greenlighting of the Willow project.”\n\nArizona\n\nBullhead City: Employees in a northwestern Arizona school district cannot discuss vaccination status or mask-wearing with students under a motion approved unanimously by the local school board. The edict from the Colorado River Union High School District Governing Board carries no repercussions for administrators, staff or teachers who violate it. That would be up to Superintendent Monte Silk, who supported the motion. The debate over masks and vaccines in schools has been heated. At least 26 school districts in Arizona have enacted their own mask mandates, even as Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has tried to prevent them and threatened schools with a loss of funding. Those school districts account for nearly 300,000 students and 450 schools, mostly around Phoenix and Tucson. The Colorado River Union High School District’s gag rule, however, is rare. Board member Ashley Gerich, who calls herself a “non-vaxxer,” requested the item be put on the board’s agenda this week. She said a couple of students, including her daughter, told her conversations about the vaccine made them feel uncomfortable, the Mohave Daily News reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Three parents are suing over a northwest Arkansas school district’s decision to require face masks after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate ban. The lawsuit filed Wednesday over the Bentonville School District’s mandate argues the local school board had no authority to impose the requirement. The parents are asking a Benton County judge to temporarily block the district from enforcing the ban while they challenge it. The parents are “forced to choose either to exercise their fundamental liberty interests in refusing to place face coverings on their children against their will or for the children to face expulsion from school,” the lawsuit said. Public health officials have urged schools to require masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus due to the highly contagious delta variant. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. More than 70 public school districts and charter schools have imposed mask mandates since Arkansas’ ban against them was blocked. The requirements cover more than half of the state’s public school students. “Our legal counsel is currently reviewing the matter and we look forward to a vigorous defense of our district,” Leslee Wright, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville School District, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A major Southern California water agency has declared a water supply alert for the first time in seven years and is asking residents to voluntarily conserve. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California took the step Tuesday, hoping to lessen the need for more severe actions such as reducing water supplies to member agencies. The move came a day after U.S. officials declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River, a key water source for Southern California. “This is a wake-up call for what lies ahead,” said Deven Upadhyay, chief operating officer for the district that supplies water to 19 million Californians, from the Los Angeles area to U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot overstate the seriousness of this drought,” he said. “Conditions are getting worse, and more importantly, we don’t know how long it will last.” Gov. Gavin Newsom last month asked Californians to scale back water use, and many of the state’s counties, mostly in Central and Northern California, are already under a state of drought emergency. Concern about water supplies spread to the state’s heavily populated southern region following a winter of low precipitation and shrinking reservoirs throughout the West.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: Forest Service officials said Wednesday that Hanging Lake Trail, a popular tourist destination in western Colorado, will be closed for the rest of the summer season and likely beyond because of extensive damage caused by large mudslides in late July. The announcement came after a preliminary assessment earlier in the week that revealed damaged and destroyed bridges, as well as large sections of the trail blocked by debris and mud. “The Hanging Lake Trail is not safe and impassable in some areas and will remain closed for the foreseeable future,” said White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams. “The debris flows we saw in July are probably not the last we will see, so there could be additional damage in the weeks and months ahead.” The trail leads to the emerald-colored Hanging Lake, which is designated as a National Natural Landmark and is about 1,000 feet up a side canyon of Glenwood Canyon. The lake was discolored by mud flows that resulted from a wildfire that torched the area last summer. “The good news is that the water in Hanging Lake is clearing from the debris flow, the boardwalk at the lake wasn’t damaged, and the fish are still swimming,” Fitzwilliams said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAshford: Ground was broken Wednesday at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children to replace buildings that burned to the ground in a February fire. The Feb. 12 blaze at the camp founded by the late actor Paul Newman destroyed a section of the eastern Connecticut camp that was made to look like the center of an Old West town. It had housed the camp’s woodworking shop, the arts and crafts area, the camp store, and its educational kitchen. Camp officials said they have received 4,500 donations for the rebuild, including a $1 million match from Travelers and the Travelers Championship golf tournament and a $1 million gift from Newman’s Own Foundation. That will allow the camp to build a new, accessible single-level “creative complex” that will not only replace what was lost but also include new features, such as a quiet sensory area for campers and dedicated space for parents and caregivers. “We want to dedicate this moment to everyone who helped us heal and made us whole again,” said Jimmy Canton, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp’s chief executive officer. “Your kindness was the bridge that brought us from grief to gratitude, and your friendship is why we are able to celebrate this milestone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Police are investigating after photos of two officers who appear to be sleeping in their patrol vehicles were posted on social media. Police said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the department was looking into the matter and that such “behavior is unacceptable to our agency, unfair to our citizens, and certainly outside of department policy.” One photo shows an officer leaned back in his driver’s seat with his eyes shut and his mouth partially open. The other shows an officer leaned back in a police SUV driver’s seat facing away from the car window and toward a computer screen. The officers, who have not been named, were scheduled to meet with command staff late Tuesday, police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hoffman said. The department’s code of conduct states that the health, well-being and overall safety of officers is a top priority. Police said in a statement that officers are encouraged not to operate vehicles when fatigued and urged to speak with a supervisor “so proper measures can be taken” if they feel unwell or unusually fatigued. “With that being said, there is no language that allows such activity,” the department said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Canceled because of the pandemic 16 months ago, Honor Flights to Washington resumed Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The program brings veterans from around the nation to D.C. to see the memorials built in their honor. The flights and tours are free. At the World War II Memorial, 113 veterans were visiting Wednesday from the Honor Flight hub in Chicago. “Probably the most touching moments are watching watching the veterans reflect as they look at the Wall of Stars,” said David Smith, president of the Honor Flight Network. “There are over 400,000 stars there; it represents those that were lost.” Wednesday’s visit honored three veterans from World War II, 34 who served in the Korean War, and 76 veterans of the Vietnam conflict.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The number of U.S. tourists who came to Sunshine State in the second quarter of this year has returned to pre-pandemic levels, though the international market is still lagging, according to figures released Thursday. Florida received about 30.6 million domestic visitors from April through June, a 6% increase over the same time in 2019 and a 216% jump from the same time last year, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic closures, state tourism marketing firm Visit Florida said in a news release. Overall, the state had 31.4 million visitors in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 220% from the same period a year earlier. Florida’s international market has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due in part to restrictions on entering the United States. Florida welcomed only 1.1 million visitors from overseas and Canada in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3.5 million visitors in the second quarter of 2019. During the spring of 2020, Florida’s major theme parks and hotels around the state were either shuttered or had limited operations due to the pandemic. As of Thursday, though, Walt Disney World is tweaking its face mask policy, allowing visitors to choose whether to wear face coverings in outdoor lines, outdoor theaters and outdoor attractions. Masks had been required previously.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Health care providers at some of the state’s largest hospital systems warned Thursday about the increasing toll of the latest coronavirus surge on younger patients, hospital staffs and health care capacity as they implored people to get vaccinated, wear masks and avoid large gatherings. The guidance came as the state’s hospitals – already struggling with rising patient numbers – brace for even higher COVID-19 case counts that could surpass a winter peak. “The unfortunate thing is we don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘We’re full, and we’re closed,’ ” said Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at Atlanta’s Grady Health System. “We’re not a hotel, so people will continue to come and our staff will continue to cope, and we’ll continue to find places to take care of these patients, but it is going to be difficult, and it’s not going to be easy, and it won’t make people happy.” Jansen said the hospital’s emergency room is facing a “tsunami” of patients infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus, forcing staff to divert ambulances to other hospitals for quicker care. As at other hospitals in the state, the influx is primarily people who are unvaccinated.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Officials on the Big Island are considering closing beaches and canceling the Ironman World Championship in response to a surge of coronavirus cases. “Right now our numbers are skyrocketing. It’s a shame because we as a county have been doing a great job,” Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth told County Council members. “But we let down our guards – I let down my guard.” The administration is revising its emergency rules and will submit the changes to Gov. David Ige for approval, West Hawaii Today reports. That revision could include a return to restrictions at parks and beaches that allow people to cross the sand only to get to the ocean to surf, swim or fish but not to gather or sit. Similar restrictions were enacted across Hawaii during the peak of the pandemic last year. The Ironman World Championship is currently set for Oct. 9 in Kailua-Kona. Roth said a decision would be made soon about whether the event could go on. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t look too positive for Ironman this year,” the mayor said. “The question with Ironman is what do you do with all the people who come to spectate.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Students across the state lost some academic ground during the coronavirus pandemic, with standardized testing scores dropping in math and language arts compared to 2019. The Idaho Department of Education released the Idaho Standardized Achievement Test scores Tuesday. The test – required under federal rules – is typically administered to students in third through eighth grades and 10th grade each spring. But the 2020 test was canceled after the federal requirement was temporarily lifted as schools closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the 2021 round of testing, students showed the biggest decline in math skills, with 39.6% of students testing at “proficient” or “advanced” levels this spring, compared to 44.4% two years ago. English language arts skills had a smaller drop, with just over 54% of students scoring as proficient or advanced compared to 55% in 2019. “The onset of the pandemic in spring 2020 disrupted the ISAT along with all Idaho school operations, so we weren’t surprised that scores did not continue the gradual upward trend of the previous few years of testing,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra said in a statement. “We expected an impact, and now we can use these results to move forward to rebuild academic performance.”\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Some residents are crying foul over a proposed museum for women’s baseball in a city that had one of the sport’s most successful teams in the 1940s. A zoning board postponed a decision Tuesday on a permit for the project at Beyer Park. The Rockford Park District is willing to sell an acre of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. A group called Friends of Beyer Stadium said it supports the concept but has acquired land directly west of Beyer Park.“Shame on you,” said Greg Schwanke, president of Friends of Beyer Stadium. “I spent 14 years out there building this place and turned it into a national attraction for the city of Rockford. We’re not going down. We’re fighting all of the way.” The Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League played at Beyer Stadium. The team was featured in the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own,” with Tom Hanks, Madonna and Geena Davis. The International Women’s Baseball Center is launching a $10 million fundraising campaign for construction of a museum and activity center. “We’ve had people already calling us from outside the area asking us when the museum is going to open,” said Rosemary Collins, a retired judge involved with the group. “They will travel here to see it. It will have an economic boon for the entire area.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Facing a pandemic unlike any his predecessors have seen, Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday announced the formation of a public health commission that will spend the next year finding ways to improve the overall health of Hoosiers. While COVID-19 response will figure into the work of the 15-person commission, Holcomb said the panel’s scope would go far beyond this latest crisis. “We’ve got our game plan right now to continue to work through the pandemic,” he said. “That’s not what this commission or this task force is about. This is a long-term look at where we want our state to be decades from now.” Holcomb tapped longtime Republican politician Luke Kenley and former state health commissioner Dr. Judy Monroe to co-chair the body. The group will convene for the first time next month and is expected to issue a report by next summer, in time for 2023 budget discussions, Holcomb said. Over the past year, Holcomb has weathered criticism from all sides for his handling of the pandemic. Some have complained that he has not done enough to halt the spread of the coronavirus, lifting restrictions like the mask mandate too soon. Others have complained that he overreached his authority in taking steps such as that mask mandate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state would welcome refugees from Afghanistan who want to resettle in Iowa, saying their situation is much different from the immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border whom the Republican governor refused to accept in April. Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst discussed plans to take refugees while attending the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday. “We’re working with the State Department right now; we’re offering our opportunity to settle here in Iowa,” Ernst said. The Republican senator said she is working with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to push the U.S. Department of State to allow as many people as possible to qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa Program, designed to aid people who worked with the U.S. military as interpreters or translators in Iraq or Afghanistan. The U.S. Bureau of Refugee Services has said Iowa could take as many as 2,000 refugees a year, and Reynolds didn’t disagree with that number. “We’ll work with them to determine what that looks like and just make sure we have a process in place and we have families and homes for them to go,” she said. “We want to be a partner, we want them here, and we want them to know that.” In April Reynolds said she rejected a federal request to accept migrant children from the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that “is the president’s problem.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Officials in some communities are battling a rise in COVID-19 cases by mandating masks for kids, issuing emergency orders and requiring vaccines. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Kansas has risen over the past two weeks from 605.14 new cases per day Aug. 3 to 797.14 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the Lawrence area, Douglas County leaders approved a health order Wednesday that will require children ages 2 to 12 to wear masks while in indoor public spaces. The decision followed four hours of public comment that included jeering and interruptions from a largely maskless crowd, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Douglas County’s health officer, Dr. Thomas Marcellino was momentarily drowned out by laughter and heckling from the crowd when he tried to explain the reasoning for the order. One person called him a liar and disgusting, and some in the crowd started chanting “no more masks.” One public commenter even compared maskless children being excluded from activities to racial segregation. There are various exceptions to the proposed order, including youth with a medical condition, mental health condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering.\n\nKentucky\n\nPine Top: During a five-year span that ended last year, Kentucky State Police fatally shot at least 41 people – more than any other law enforcement agency in the commonwealth, according to a published report. Police declined to release the numbers, but the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting and the Marshall Project built a database using a combination of publicly available data and state police records, according to an article the entities published in partnership with the Lexington Herald-Leader. The report said Kentucky troopers killed more people in rural communities than any other department in the nation, according to the partnership’s analysis of data compiled by the Washington Post. None of the 41 fatal shootings resulted in troopers being prosecuted. Of those killed, about 75% were armed, and a majority were suffering from addiction or mental health problems, according to the investigation. Kentucky State Police investigate shootings with no outside oversight, a practice some experts and prosecutors say is problematic. “I don’t think it should be done,” said Dave Stengel, the former commonwealth’s attorney in Louisville. He said there is potential for conflicts of interest. “Everybody knows everybody else.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A civilian Pentagon official ordered the Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday to conduct a full environmental assessment of a $9.4 billion Formosa Plastics complex planned in the state, drawing praise from environmentalists. Jaime Pinkham, the Army’s acting assistant secretary for civil works, ordered the review after a virtual meeting with opponents of a Corps wetlands permit that allowed Formosa Plastics Group member FG LA LLC to build 10 chemical plants and four other major facilities on the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Critics praised the decision. “The Army Corps has finally heard our pleas and understands our pain. With God’s help, Formosa Plastics will soon pull out of our community,” said a statement by Sharon Lavigne, who founded the local group Rise St. James to fight the planned complex announced in 2018. Formosa, based in Taiwan, wants to produce polyethylene, polypropylene, polymer and ethylene glycol on 2,400 acres in St. James Parish. Dubbed the Sunshine Project because it’s near the Sunshine Bridge, the project is expected to provide 1,200 permanent jobs and up to 8,000 construction jobs, the state has said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Several music venues plan to require vaccinations for concertgoers. State Theater, Thompson’s Point and Portland House of Music are among those in the city requiring COVID-19 shots or a negative test for the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the Opera House at Boothbay Harbor and Stone Mountain Arts Center in Brownfield are also requiring proof of vaccination. The marquee sign above State Theater says: “Vaccines are a gateway drug to concerts.” “We hope we can keep our doors open, and we need your support and understanding to do so,” the Portland House of Music said. The announcements come amid a surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus, which now accounts for virtually all infections in Maine. Meanwhile, the University of Maine System is requiring all students, faculty, staff and visitors to wear wear face coverings inside its buildings. The new policy applies to all, regardless of vaccination status. “With our classrooms and other indoor spaces no longer set up to impose social distancing, face coverings are an important strategy we can employ to effectively control the transmission of COVID, regardless of an individual’s vaccination status and testing participation,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy wrote. Bates College has adopted a similar requirement at its Lewiston campus.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit against Shore Transit after the public transit agency refused to display PETA advertisements on its buses. The animal rights group applied to display two advertisements on Shore Transit buses in May 2020. Both advertisements read: “No One Needs to Kill to Eat. Close the slaughterhouses: Save the workers, their families, and the animals.” Shore Transit denied the application, saying the advertisements violated its advertising policy. The agency prohibits advertisements that are “political, controversial, offensive, objectionable or in poor taste,” according to the suit. However, PETA claims Shore Transit does not have any written guidance for following these terms. PETA alleges that by denying the application, Shore Transit violated the First and 14th Amendments. In July 2021, PETA renewed its application to advertise, and it says it has not received a response. PETA filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing PETA. The suit names Shore Transit, Shore Transit Director Brad Bellacicco and the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland as defendants. Shore Transit offers public transportation in Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than three centuries after a woman was wrongly convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death, she’s finally on the verge of being exonerated, thanks to a curious eighth grade civics class. State Sen. Diana DiZoglio, D-Methuen, has introduced legislation to clear the name of Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was condemned in 1693 at the height of the Salem Witch Trials but never executed. DiZoglio said she was inspired by sleuthing done by a group of 13- and 14-year-olds at North Andover Middle School. Civics teacher Carrie LaPierre’s students painstakingly researched Johnson and the steps that would need to be taken to make sure she was formally pardoned. “It is important that we work to correct history,” DiZoglio said Wednesday. “We will never be able to change what happened to these victims, but at the very least, we can set the record straight.” If lawmakers approve the measure, Johnson will be the last accused witch to be cleared, according to Witches of Massachusetts Bay, a group devoted to the history and lore of the 17th-century witch hunts. In the 328 years since a frenzy of Puritan injustice that began in 1692, dozens of suspects officially were cleared, including Johnson’s own mother, the daughter of a minister whose conviction eventually was reversed. But for some reason, Johnson’s name wasn’t included in various legislative attempts to set the record straight.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: In need of quick cash and find yourself in a forest? Well, you may have an opportunity on your hands. The state Department of Natural Resources is offering $75 for bushels of pine cones for the month of September. The agency is in need of these for replanting purposes, refilling forests with new conifer trees. But the DNR is requesting a specific kind of cone: the red pine cone, marked by its craggy, reddish bark and 4- to 6-inch needles that grow in pairs. The DNR notes that Scotch and Austrian pine cones will not be accepted. Scotch cones are marked by their flayed and thick bark, while Austrian cones are more orb-like than red cones. Cones should be picked off the tree, as fallen cones are usually too old or wet. And one can tell the age of the cone from the way the scales are arranged. The scales should be closed with a hint of green or purple. All brown and they’re too far gone. The correct kind of bag is being distributed at select DNR locations. The cones will be processed in machines that harvest their seeds, which will be used to replenish the in-high-demand red pine, among other initiatives to refill Michigan forests.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: A wildfire in the Superior National Forest that crews have been fighting since the weekend has grown to 61/ 4 square miles, but U.S. Forest Service officials said Thursday morning that it grew little overnight. The Forest Service said lightning caused the fire first spotted Sunday near Greenwood Lake, about 25 miles southwest of Isabella. It grew from 5 square miles to 61/ 4 by Wednesday evening, after what officials described as a “very active” afternoon of expansion on its western flank. But in an update posted Thursday morning, Forest Service officials said there was no significant change overnight, which is often the case with forest fires. Thursday’s forecast in the area called for continued hot, dry weather, with thunderstorms expected Friday night and Saturday. The fire led authorities to evacuate about 75 homes Monday near McDougal Lake, just north of where the fire started. Many dwellings in the area, which is deep in the forest, are seasonal cabins. Some small portions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the north and northeast have been closed as a precaution due to the blaze, and two smaller fires spotted over the weekend in the wilderness. No injuries or damage to structures has been reported. Crews are also fighting several smaller wildfires in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s only pediatric hospital is treating its largest number of COVID-19 cases so far during the pandemic, the hospital said Thursday. Children’s of Mississippi is part of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. “Today, Children’s of Mississippi and the University of Mississippi Medical Center reported 28 children with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, the highest number of pediatric COVID-19 patients at the state’s only children’s hospital since the beginning of the pandemic,” the hospital said on Facebook. “Of these hospitalized children, 100% are unvaccinated. This number includes eight children in the ICU, including five who are too young to receive the vaccine.” Meanwhile, state health officials say almost 1,000 hospital beds that could be used to treat patients during the latest surge of coronavirus are unstaffed because of a shortage of health care workers. Mississippi is facing a record number of people hospitalized with the virus – 1,633 on Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health – and has the highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case tracker.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two employees are suing Springfield Public Schools over the district’s mandatory racial equity training, which they contend violates their rights and is an “unconstitutional condition of employment.” The federal lawsuit was filed Wednesday by Jennifer Lumley, a records secretary for the special services department, and Brooke Henderson, who works on plans for students with disabilities. Henderson is a member of Back on Track America and has frequently accused the district of inserting critical race theory into its training. Critical race theory, which studies America’s history through the lens of racism, is not mentioned in the lawsuit. But the women allege the term “equity” and other phrases used during the training are code for the theory, which they contend conditions “individuals to see each other’s skin color first and foremost.” All employees were required to take the training during the 2020-21 school year or lose pay. As part of the training, they were required to commit to equity and becoming “anti-racist educators,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed against the district, its school board and four district officials. Stephen Hall, spokesman for the district, said the district is prepared to defend its equity efforts and is confident the court will find the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University and the University of Montana are telling everyone to wear masks indoors on campus. Montana State University President Waded Cruzado and University of Montana President Seth Bodnar both cited the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus as one reason for their requests and also urged people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Cruzado said Montana State’s decision would last through Oct. 1 but said in a message to students, staff and faculty that mandates “foment dissension and division.” She also said she understands people find pandemic-related mandates “odious,” and they require enforcement, so she is asking people to voluntarily wear their masks because it is the right thing to do. Bodnar also said UM is urging but not requiring masks, and he said the university will revisit its stance Sept. 20. He noted the uptick in cases in Missoula County had placed it in a “high risk” zone based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and he pointed to advice from health officials that says masks can help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials are dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak at a state correctional facility as coronavirus cases surge statewide. After 33 inmates tested positive for the virus at the Diagnostic and Evaluation Center in Lincoln, officials paused all visits and volunteer activities there and asked county jails to delay sending new inmates if they can. All adult men who enter the state prison system go through the facility. Officials said all inmates who test positive for the virus are being housed away from other inmates to limit the spread of COVID-19, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The state Department of Correctional Services has also started providing bars of soap, which inmates had to purchase before the pandemic, and masks to inmates who request them. Officials say they have also stepped up efforts to disinfect spaces where people live and congregate in prisons. Department Director Scott Frakes said the increase in cases in the prison system – which lists 36 active cases – follows an increase in the community. “It is not a surprise that we have an uptick in cases now, especially at DEC which serves as the intake facility for all male inmates who are new admits or returning to us from the community,” Frakes said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The U.S. debut of a long-established international food and beverage industry trade show could make Las Vegas a magnet for foodies and food product retailers, distributors and wholesalers, event producers and tourism officials said. An announcement Tuesday by Emerald Holding Inc. and Comexposium, owner of the SIAL brand of worldwide food shows, was timed as a topper to Emerald’s ongoing International Pizza Expo now at the Las Vegas Convention Center. “This partnership underscores the ever-increasing importance of creating a single event for the food industry,” Jessica Blue, Emerald executive vice president, said in a statement. SIAL, for Salon International de L’Alimentation, has a 50-year history and says it draws some 16,000 exhibitors and 700,000 visitors from 200 countries to 10 shows in France, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. “We plan to bring a new international food exhibition to life in Las Vegas to enable comprehensive sourcing of new products,” said Nicolas Trentesaux, SIAL Network Global CEO. The announcement hosted by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority puts the SIAL America show on the Convention Center schedule for March 2022.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A billionaire software company CEO has given a former hermit $180,000 to rebuild his cabin in a new location. Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, gave David Lidstone a personal check last week, Lidstone’s friend, Jodie Gedeon said on Facebook. A spokesperson for the data analytics software company confirmed the donation to the Concord Monitor. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the Monitor. “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” There has been an outpouring of support for Lidstone since he was jailed July 15 and accused of squatting for nearly 30 years on property owned by a Vermont man. His cabin burned down this month shortly before his release, but he recently secured temporary housing through the winter. The location is being kept secret to protect Lidstone’s privacy, Gedeon said. But supporters will have a chance to meet Lidstone at a “thank you” event in Warner, New Hampshire, on Saturday. Lidstone has said he doesn’t think he can go back to being a hermit. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: Huge gates that could be slammed shut when major storms approach would be built across the mouths of three inlets in New Jersey, closable barriers would cut parts of two bays in half, and 19,000 homes would be raised as part of a $16 billion plan to address back bay flooding, one of the major sources of storm damage at the Jersey Shore. After five years of study, federal and state officials unveiled recommendations Thursday that would drastically change the appearance of some iconic spots at the shore. It also would be one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. The term refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines. Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy. “To better protect New Jersey’s residents, communities, and economy, we must plan and prepare today for the climate change risks of tomorrow,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heard from industry officials Wednesday about what it will take to boost renewable energy development in the state and across the nation as the Biden administration pushes its initiatives to reduce emissions and address climate change. Developers and policy experts said without more transmission infrastructure and a cohesive grid, renewable energy will be stranded in remote spots like rural New Mexico, and opportunities for economic development will be hampered as a result. “This stuff is as important as building highways. It’s as important as building hospitals and schools,” said Fernando Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority. “The only way we’re going to accomplish this … is that we really do need a predictable regulatory landscape.” He and others told Granholm about permitting bottlenecks that have slowed the development of major transmission projects in New Mexico. They said if the Biden administration wants to reach its goals, the U.S. can’t afford to take decades to site and build transmission lines. A major line to connect wind farms in eastern New Mexico to the grid, for example, is almost complete but needs the approval of more than 430 easements from ranchers and other landowners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A group of restaurants asked a judge this week to block the city’s latest effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, calling the city’s mandate that customers show proof of vaccination “arbitrary, irrational, unscientific and unlawful.” The group argued that the new rules would severely harm their businesses and livelihood. The city’s proof-of-vaccination edict went into effect Tuesday and requires anyone dining indoors at restaurants, going to museums, attending concerts, working out at a gym or entering many indoor public venues show proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The group of restaurateurs that filed the lawsuit in Richmond County, which encompasses Staten Island, said restaurants and other establishments included in the city’s vaccine mandate were unfairly targeted because many other places such as grocery stores, hair salons, churches, schools and office buildings were excluded from the mandate. “This vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to the fact that it targets certain establishments but not others with no rational whatsoever,” the lawsuit says. Mayor Bill de Blasio first announced the new rules Aug. 3. He said enforcement won’t begin until Sept. 13 to give businesses more time to prepare and people an opportunity to get vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A college tradition has come under scrutiny after pictures the school posted on social media showed hundreds of students gathered at a campus landmark waiting to get a drink of water in the midst of a COVID-19 surge. Pictures posted to Twitter by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed a line of students approaching the Old Well on Wednesday waiting to get a drink and a picture. According to tradition, students who drink from the fountain at the well on the first day of classes will get good grades for the entire school year. It was first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh. The tradition was canceled last year because of the pandemic. The resumption brought a thread of negative reactions. “Tradition aside, you couldn’t just find a couple paper cups for this? In the middle of the fourth wave of a global pandemic?” said one response. “It would have been a great idea to put this tradition on hold,” said another response. According to the newspaper, the university issued a statement saying it had consulted with public health experts who agreed it was OK to proceed with the tradition since there is little to no evidence of surface transmission of the coronavirus. Students who chose to participate were encouraged to wear a mask and maintain distance while waiting in line.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There are no current plans to bring any of the people fleeing the conflict in Afghanistan to the state, officials said. The North Dakota Department of Human Services, who oversees the Refugee Resettlement Program, said the process is actually quite extensive. It takes eight different government agencies and six background checks for a person to gain clearance for the Refugee Resettlement Program in North Dakota, officials said. The state’s refugee coordinator said the people being transported to the U.S. are classified as Special Immigrant Visa Holders. Each person will be resettled in an area of the country in which Afghans have already settled, KXNET-TV reports. “There are strong communities that have already been set up for individuals that have a successful history of gaining employment, assimilating within the community, learning English and, you know, really developing successful relationships with a variety of different community members,” Holly Triska-Dally said. The Pentagon said that over the prior 24 hours about 2,000 people, including 325 American citizens, had been flown out of the Kabul international airport on 18 flights by U.S. Air Force C-17 transport planes.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Whether because of a lack of computer access, lack of awareness or mistrust, about 180,000 children in the state are not benefiting from the government’s enhanced Child Tax Credit program. That’s the conclusion drawn by Alex Coccia, a senior policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a national nonprofit organization. On a conference call with several members of local and national nonprofits this week, Coccia said that through the first two months of the program, 2.151 million Ohio children have received the tax credit’s advance payments, but he estimated that 2.33 million children are eligible. The monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child began in July and will continue through December, with another six months’ worth of money available upon filing a tax return in 2022. The payments go out automatically to the roughly 90% of eligible Americans who filed a tax return this year, but the concern is that the “non-filers” still may be unaware of the benefit. Those who do not file a tax return, because of very low incomes or several other reasons, must “opt in” through an online portal on the IRS website. And that’s where access issues begin. “We’re worried about non-English speakers, those who lack secure housing, and those with limited internet access,” Coccia said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s school districts should have “the autonomy” to enact mask requirements, which are banned by state law, according to the superintendent of schools. “School districts deserve the autonomy to enact policies that protect our schoolchildren and staff from COVID exposure and infection,” Oklahoma Superintendent Joy Hofmeister said in a statement Wednesday. Hofmeister’s comments came after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to her and Gov. Kevin Stitt that the ban may violate the American Rescue Plan Act that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom. Cardona sent similar letters to several other states with similar mask bans. Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. A spokesperson for Stitt told the Tulsa World on Wednesday that the governor had not yet seen the letter. Hofmeister, whose recommendation for a statewide mask mandate in schools was rejected in July 2020 in a 4-3 vote by the state Board of Education, said vaccinations and mask wearing are key to keeping schools open for in-person classes. “I think Ronald Reagan was right when he said those closest to the problem are the ones best suited to address it,” Hofmeister said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated Oregon resident and tribal citizen Charles F. “Chuck” Sams III to head the National Park Service. If confirmed by the Senate, Sams would be the first Native American to hold the position. He is Cayuse and Walla Walla and a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Sams has worked in state and tribal governments and the nonprofit natural resource and conservation management fields for over 25 years, White House officials said. “The diverse experience that Chuck brings to the National Park Service will be an incredible asset as we work to conserve and protect our national parks to make them more accessible for everyone,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release. “The outdoors are for everyone, and we have an obligation to protect them for generations to come.” Currently, Sams is a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, a role appointed by Gov. Kate Brown. The Democratic governor said in a statement Wednesday that it was a proud day for Oregon. She described Sams as a “passionate student and teacher of the history and culture of our lands and our people.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Mister Rogers’ deliveryman’s son, who’s now a real-life mail carrier, briefly appeared this week on an episode of a children’s show based on one of Mister Rogers’ puppets. Alex Newell, 39, is the son of David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Alex Newell had a cameo on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In Wednesday’s episode, Newell appears as a mail carrier ensuring a little girl’s care package has been delivered to a friend, according to the newspaper. David Newell said Rogers was the first person who came to visit him at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital after each of his three children were born, including Alex. “In a way, Alex grew up in Mister Rogers’ neighborhood, in reality and in pretend,” his dad said. “He watched the program as he was growing up, and now he’s making a delivery on (‘Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood’). And that makes me so proud.” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” features 4-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original show’s Daniel Striped Tiger.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The cost of running the city’s guaranteed-income pilot program will be more than the total of cash payments given to low-income families. The 110 households selected to take part in the pilot will receive $500 monthly, adding up to $6,000 over the course of the one-year experiment. In total, $660,000 will be given away in no-strings-attached cash grants. Meanwhile, expenses associated with administering the program and researching its effectiveness are already expected to top $723,000, according to an estimate provided by Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office. While that means that the total cost of the pilot program will exceed the $1.1 million that Elorza had originally anticipated, none of that is taxpayer money. The pilot program is being fully funded by private donors, including Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Joining a growing number of Democratic mayors nationwide, Elorza has championed the idea that a guaranteed income can help lift people out of poverty, pointing to Stockton, California, which found that many recipients used the money for basic needs and that they were more likely to be employed full time after taking part in the program. Providence is now encouraging anyone who makes less than 200% of the federal poverty level to apply before the Saturday deadline.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The Myrtle Beach International Airport has been the busiest airport in the Palmetto State this summer. The airport set a record for passenger traffic with more than 500,000 total passengers in July, WBTW-TV reports. That’s the highest monthly passenger count ever recorded at an airport in South Carolina’s history. Total passenger traffic for July totaled nearly 550,000 – a 49% increase over July 2019, airport officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of the South Dakota National Guard says Gov. Kristi Noem didn’t tell him she would use a private donation for the deployment to the U.S. border with Mexico until after the mission was already planned. Noem’s decision to accept a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire last month was met with hefty criticism from those who said it allowed a private donor to commandeer a military force. But Maj. Gen. Jeffery Marlette told a legislative budgeting committee Wednesday that the donation was not a factor in planning the deployment. “Our National Guard is not for hire,” he told lawmakers. “Nowhere in this planning process was there a discussion of, ‘I’ll go send the Guard if I can find somebody to pay for it.’ ” The Republican governor last month described the $1 million donation offer from billionaire Republican donor Willis Johnson as a “surprise” that came as she was deciding whether to send police officers or National Guard troops, as well as how to fund the deployment. The state was responding to a request from Texas and Arizona to send law enforcement officers under an agreement between states to assist during emergencies\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Hospitals warned Thursday that the intensive care units are full in nearly every hospital in the state’s major metropolitan areas, pleading with Tennesseans to get vaccinated and wear masks while not going so far as to criticize Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of mask mandates in K-12 schools. Meanwhile, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona warned Tennessee in a letter Wednesday that the order might violate federal law. The Tennessee Hospital Association said in its statement that the hospitals in metropolitan areas with full ICUs are the same ones that normally accept transfers from smaller hospitals of the sickest patients. “This means that if you or a loved one need treatment for any type of serious healthcare problem like a severe injury, heart attack, or stroke, you may not be able to access the care you need, when you need it,” the statement says. It cites Tennessee Department of Health data from May and July that found “at least 88% of these COVID hospitalizations and 94% of COVID deaths are among unvaccinated individuals.” And a Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine report released Thursday found hospitalizations have increased more than tenfold in a little more than a month, the fastest rate of increase of the pandemic.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Austin City Limits Music Festival announced plans Thursday to require a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all patrons attending the event, scheduled to take place Oct. 1-3 and 8-10 in Zilker Park. While the festival will still admit children 10 and younger for free with a ticketed adult, the popular Austin Kiddie Limits section of festival programming has been paused for the 2021 event. Families attending the festival will be required to provide a negative virus test result for unvaccinated children. The festival also has added a “fan health pledge” to the website. It requests that fans skip the festival if they have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus within 14 days of the beginning of the festival or if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 48 hours of the festival. It also requests that fans do not attend if they “have travelled to any international territory identified by federal or applicable state or local governments as being subject to travel or quarantine advisories due to COVID-19.” The move comes as Austin grapples with rising coronavirus hospitalizations in the area. Music venues and industry leaders have been trying to figure out how to increase safety measures right as large events return.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A teacher is no longer employed at a high school after a video of her sharing political opinions in class began circulating online, school district officials said Wednesday. The teacher at Lehi High School was initially placed on administrative leave after the video surfaced, but Alpine School District officials confirmed she no longer works there. District spokesman David Stephenson declined to say whether the teacher was fired or resigned. Video that appears to be surreptitiously recorded by a student in the classroom shows the teacher criticizing people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was shared online by conservative activists who have led demonstrations against mask mandates and vaccines throughout the state. “I don’t have to be happy about the fact that there’s kids coming in here with their variants that could possibly get me or my family sick,” the video showed the teacher saying. “That’s rude, and I’m not going to pretend like it’s not.” She can also be heard saying that most students are smarter than their parents and that they don’t need to believe everything their parents believe. The Alpine School District, which declined to identify the teacher, said in a statement that the district disavowed her comments.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: The state’s largest utility is reminding customers that they can apply for grant money to get caught up on past-due utility bills related to the pandemic. A total of $55 million in free grant money is available to help renters, homeowners, businesses and farms pay overdue utility bills tied to the pandemic, Green Mountain Power said in a statement Tuesday. “More than 20,000 GMP customers have fallen at least two months behind on their accounts during the pandemic, yet only about 2,000 have applied for these new assistance programs,” said Steve Costello, a GMP vice president. The Vermont Department of Public Service is taking grant applications through Oct. 25. The money, which does not have to be repaid, can go toward past-due landline phone, electric, natural gas and water service bills, the utility said.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A school board has voted to ignore state guidelines on protecting transgender students rather than change its policies as the law requires before the school year starts. The Newport News School Board voted 5-1 against the change with one member abstaining at a crowded meeting Tuesday, The Daily Press reports. Newport News is one of the largest districts in the state and among the first in Hampton Roads to refuse to follow the law passed last year. Under the law, school districts must adopt policies consistent with or more comprehensive than the model policies. They include allowing students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that conform to their gender identity and allowing students to use pronouns and a name that reflect their gender identity. Most board members said they wanted more information, citing their discomfort with parts of the guidelines. Before the vote, Chair Douglas Brown said there’s nothing stopping the district from spending more time on the matter before revisiting it. Still, Brown said the law violates the rights of Christian parents like him who believe kids aren’t capable of making choices about their gender.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say there are more people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state than at any time during the pandemic. Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association. said as of Thursday morning there were 1,240 people with the coronavirus in state hospitals. The previous highest number was about 1,100 in December. “Hospitals are still really, really full across the state,” Sauer said at a news conference. Hospitals are also seeing more people due to the effects of recent heat waves, smoke from wildfires and injuries due to summer activities. Sauer said until the recent uptick in cases and hospitalizations due to the delta variant, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the state had been holding steady at about 300 to 350 people. The numbers began increasing in early July and have been doubling about every two weeks. There has been a slight slowing in COVID-19 admissions recently, but Sauer said it’s too early to say if that’s a trend. To help free up capacity, Sauer said hospitals have been working with the state to move other patients who can be discharged into places like long-term care facilities. “We will have plenty of capacity if we can move patients out,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh toured an underground coal mine for the first time, joining U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin at a northern West Virginia facility Wednesday. Walsh did his best to signal that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration won’t be an enemy of the coal industry as he and Manchin visited American Consolidated Natural Resources’ Golden Ridge Portal Mine near Wheeling. “It was quite the experience, I’ll tell you that,” Walsh said in a telephone interview on his way back to Washington, D.C. He described donning the proper safety equipment, taking an elevator ride down to the mine, and then a mantrip ride by rail to the longwall to watch a machine grind and extract coal from the seam. Walsh’s agency oversees the Mine Safety and Health Administration as well as the administration of benefits for coal miners disabled by black lung disease. “I felt it was really important for me to go down and get a feel for what mine workers do,” Walsh said. “I have a different understanding and appreciation of the work.” Democratic candidates for president have struggled in recent years to connect with voters in West Virginia, in part due to a push toward clean energy under the Obama administration. Still, despite his promises, coal did not come roaring back under Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Dells: The Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park is building the nation’s first rotating waterslide as part of a $23 million expansion. The project includes a new 22,500-square-foot building attached to the indoor waterpark. The rotating waterslide, named Medusa’s Slidewheel, is a four-person raft ride that combines the rotation of a Ferris wheel with the propulsion of a waterslide, according to a news release from architecture and engineer firm Ramaker and Associates, which is working on the project. Outside the United States, the only other rotating waterslides are in China and Poland, the news release said. Mount Olympus announced the project on its Facebook page Aug. 6. Construction began in July and is scheduled to be completed by Memorial Day 2022. “It will be the coolest slide that ever hit the waterpark industry,” Mount Olympus CEO and owner Nick Laskaris told WiscNews. “Not just the Dells, but the industry as a whole.” In addition to Medusa’s Slidewheel, the indoor waterpark expansion project will include a large swimming pool area, Laskaris told WiscNews. The existing indoor waterpark will be remodeled to match the new addition, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Marijuana advocates plan to begin circulating petitions in September for two proposed ballot measures – one asking if the state should legalize medical marijuana, and the other if it should decriminalize pot. The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office this week approved the wording of the proposed questions. The Secretary of State’s Office has now begun the process of seeking bids for printing the petitions. The process ends Aug. 25. The Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws plans to begin gathering signatures on or soon after Sept. 1. “We’ll be hitting events, going door to door. We intend to get it all wrapped up by February,” Wyoming NORML Executive Director Bennett Sondeno said Wednesday. The group has a “big list” of Wyoming events where it plans to gather signatures in the next few months, Sondeno said. February is the deadline to submit enough valid signatures to the Wyoming secretary of state to get the measures before voters in the 2022 general election, Sondeno said. Wyoming is among a minority of states that don’t allow cannabis in some fashion.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/11/surfboards-printed-home-cherry-blossom-sculptures-news-around-states/116939290/", "title": "Surfboards up, 3D-printed home: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge Tuesday that it has nearly finished construction to use nitrogen gas to carry out death sentences, an execution method authorized by state law but never put into use. The court filing did not describe how the proposed execution system would work. When legislation was approved authorizing nitrogen hypoxia, proponents theorized death by nitrogen hypoxia could be a simpler, more humane execution method. Death would be caused by forcing the inmate to breathe only nitrogen, depriving the body of oxygen. Alabama in 2018 became the third state – along with Oklahoma and Mississippi – to authorize the untested execution method. Lawyers for the state wrote in a court filing Tuesday that the Alabama Department of Corrections “is nearing completion of the initial physical build for the nitrogen hypoxia system and its safety measures.” The information was disclosed in a court filing Tuesday involving a lawsuit over the presence of spiritual advisers in the death chamber. State lawyers said they did not yet know if advisers could safely be present. No state has used nitrogen hypoxia to carry out an execution or developed a protocol for its use, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. He likened the planned first usage to human experimentation.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: High school seniors in the capital city will be required to earn half a credit less than prior graduating classes under a change adopted this week that was billed as a way to acknowledge the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on learning. Under the change adopted by the Juneau School District Board of Education, the classes of 2022, 2023 and 2024 would need 22.5 credits to graduate, rather than the 23 credits previously required. Reducing the elective credit total by a half-credit would allow “more time for recovery of core content credits or other credits lost,” the proposal said. The district superintendent, Bridget Weiss, said students still must complete core academic credits, such as in English and math, KTOO Public Media reports. “What we’re hoping is that this just relieves a little bit of the pressure for those students who lost some credits throughout the pandemic and provides a little bit of space in their schedule to make up those core academic credits,” she said. Juneau schools would continue meeting state graduation standards.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Habitat for Humanity unveiled its progress on a 3D-printed home in the city Wednesday – the first of its kind for the nonprofit in the country – and said it could be a possible solution to the lack of affordable housing in the area. Between 70% and 80% of the three-bedroom, two-bathroom single-family home is 3D-printed. The remainder is a traditional build. PERI, a company based in Germany, provided its 3D printer for the project, shipping it to the U.S. in March before printing began in May. The company says it built Germany’s first 3D-printed house in 2020 and Europe’s largest 3D-printed apartment building. “The 3D printing project in Tempe is now continuing this success story in the USA,” PERI managing director Thomas Imbacher said in a news release. Jason Barlow, Habitat for Humanity Central Arizona’s president and CEO, said the organization had identified a family to live in the home, which was designed by Arizona-based architecture firm Candelaria Design Associates. Barlow said the family has lived and worked in Tempe for years but struggled to find affordable housing. Their new home “fits that bill,” he said. The project has been in the works for more than 18 months and is expected to be completed around September or October.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday approved performance-related merit pay raises of as much as 3% for state employees. Hutchinson announced that $28 million in state and federal funds was allocated for the merit pay increases, which he said will be the largest performance pay raises offered since he took office in 2015. The Republican governor cited the work from the state’s employees in response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the raises will be added to employees’ existing pay and won’t be a one-time raise. Nearly 26,000 employees are eligible for the bumps. “This last year, our workforce has shown dedication, resilience and flexibility during this pandemic,” Hutchinson said at a news conference. “It’s been circumstances that no workforce has been through in the last 100 years.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLong Beach: City officials have said they will spend $2.5 million to maintain the historic Queen Mary ocean liner for the next six months and plan out the repairs needed to reopen the tourist destination. The Long Beach City Council on Tuesday voted unanimously to enter into a $2 million temporary caretaker contract with the ship’s current on-ship operator, Evolution Hospitality, for the next six months with the possibility of a six-month extension, The Orange County Register reports. Officials said the remaining $500,000 will pay for the city’s contract engineer, Moffatt & Nichol, to develop the engineering and design repair work, which is estimated to cost $5 million. It was not immediately known how the city would pay for future repair work. Council members agreed Tuesday that regaining control of the ship for the first time since 1978 provides the city an opportunity to preserve and leverage an asset considered synonymous with the city. “Anywhere we go, the Queen Mary represents Long Beach,” Councilwoman Mary Zendejas said. “Nobody is going to be able to take care of the Queen Mary as much as we can now that we have it back in our hands.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has its first litter of gray wolf pups since the 1940s, wildlife officials said Wednesday. A state biologist and district wildlife manager each spotted the litter of at least three wolf pups over the weekend with their parents, two adult wolves known to live in the state, Gov. Jared Polis announced in a news release. Most wolf litters have four to six pups, so there could be more. The discovery comes after Colorado voters narrowly approved a ballot measure last year that requires the state to reintroduce the animal on public lands in the western part of the state by the end of 2023. Gray wolves lost their federal protected status as an endangered species earlier this year. But they remain protected at the state level, and hunting the animals in Colorado is illegal. Penalties for violations include fines, jail time and a loss of hunting license privileges. “These pups will have plenty of potential mates when they grow up to start their own families,” Polis said in a statement. Gray wolves were hunted, trapped and poisoned into extinction in Colorado in the 1940s. Officials last year confirmed the presence of a small pack of wolves in northwestern Colorado after a number of sightings since 2019. The animals were believed to have come down from Wyoming’s Yellowstone National Park.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Lawmakers closed out a legislative session like no other Wednesday night, with the state Senate approving a two-year, $46.3 billion budget that proponents said will help Connecticut in its continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic while beginning to address some long-standing inequities in the state. Legislators wrapped up their work shortly before midnight. In the final moments, the House and Senate chambers were nearly filled with lawmakers – a rare sight this session, given the strict COVID-19 protocols. As in the House, there was bipartisan support for the budget in the Senate, where the bill passed 31 to 4. Shortly afterward, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said he will sign it into law, calling it the “most progressive, transformative and life-changing budget our state has ever seen.” The new fiscal year begins July 1. Wednesday’s vote marked the culmination of an unusual and challenging legislative session, during which the Capitol was closed to the public, and staff and legislators were forced to rely on Zoom meetings to get much of their work done, including committee meetings and public hearings. Besides dealing with the devastating impacts of the pandemic, the General Assembly was also under pressure to pass a budget that addresses the state’s racial and economic inequities.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic lawmakers are proposing to give public officials more reasons to deny requests for public records under the state’s Freedom of Information Act and require people seeking records to pay new fees. The measure cleared a Democrat-led Senate committee Wednesday after a public hearing in which representatives of open-government groups spoke against it and warned that it could lead to more government secrecy. The legislation allows government workers to deny FOIA requests that they consider to be “unreasonably broad, unduly burdensome, intended to disrupt the essential functions of the public body” or “abusive.” The bill was filed on behalf of Democratic Attorney General Kathleen Jenning’s office, which is charged with reviewing petitions from people whose requests for public records have been denied. State solicitor Aaron Goldstein said the Department of Justice has seen “basically a tripling of the volume of work” in recent years. While the growing number of petitions suggests that more FOIA requests are being denied, Goldstein told committee members that there are “a small amount of abusive filers” whose record requests undermine the intent of the FOIA.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Organizers of the National Cherry Blossom Festival plan to relocate the “Art in Bloom” sculptures from this year’s festival event throughout the area, WUSA-TV reports. Of the 26 oversized cherry blossom sculptures, at least one will remain in each of D.C.’s eight wards, with another five to be auctioned to the public for their “dynamic aesthetics and one-of-kind interpretations,” according to the festival’s website. “The Art in Bloom sculptures radiated springtime across the district and beyond, and now it’s time to find permanent homes for these one-of-a-kind creations,” said Diana Mayhew, president and CEO of the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Mayhew said 17 of the sculptures have already been acquired by organizations, businesses and private citizens in the capital region. The five sculptures up for auction will primarily help fund the festival to ensure it can remain free and open to the public, but a portion of the proceeds will also be given to the Trust for the National Mall’s Cherry Tree Endowment, according to the auction’s webpage. The sculptures were part of this year’s “Blossom Hunt,” in which visitors were tasked with finding the sculptures around the city and posting them on social media for the chance to win prizes. The online auction ends Tuesday.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state Board of Education banned “critical race theory” from public school classrooms Thursday, adopting new rules it said would shield schoolchildren from curricula that could “distort historical events.” Florida’s move was widely expected as a national debate intensifies about how race should be used as a lens in classrooms to examine the country’s tumultuous history. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appeared by video at the top of the board’s meeting, urging its members, many of whom he appointed, to adopt the new measures he asserted would serve students with the facts rather than “trying to indoctrinate them with ideology.” The Black Lives Matter movement has helped bring contentious discussions about race to the forefront of American discourse, and classrooms have become a battleground. Supporters contend that federal law has preserved the unequal treatment of people on the basis of race and that the country was founded on the theft of land and labor. Opponents of critical race theory say schoolchildren should not be taught that America is fundamentally racist. Governors and legislatures in Republican-led states around the country are considering or have signed into law bills that would limit how teachers can frame American history.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Residents receiving unemployment benefits will once again be required to look for work, and those whose hours have been reduced will be able to earn less before payments drop, beginning June 27. Labor Commissioner Mark Butler announced the changes Thursday, also saying employers with many laid-off workers collecting benefits will face higher unemployment insurance taxes after that date. It’s a further tightening of Georgia’s unemployment assistance as Butler and other elected Republican leaders say the state needs to do more to push people into the workforce. Georgia announced last month that, beginning June 27, it would cut off federal programs that provide a $300-a-week boost to people on the jobless rolls, as well as programs that pay federal money to people who are not usually eligible for state unemployment or have been receiving jobless aid for longer than the state provides. Those federal programs will last through September. Butler had earlier signaled he would reinstate work-search requirements, a move underway in more than three-quarters of states. Employers will also be asked to report when workers refuse to return to work or refuse a job offer, which could cause workers to lose benefits going forward. To keep drawing benefits after June 26, residents must register with the EmployGeorgia.com website.\n\nHawaii\n\nLahaina: Restaurants are having a hard time serving an influx of tourists returning to the islands as pandemic restrictions across the nation ease. Gov. David Ige has said the 50% capacity limit on restaurants will not increase until 60% of residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. But capacity increases won’t help some restaurants with limited space, Hawaii News Now reports. On Maui, Cool Cat Cafe General Manager Paul Kemp said his restaurant won’t be able to serve many more people until social distancing rules change. “If we can get 6 feet to 3 feet, that’s when everything will really come together for the restaurants and put everything really back to the old norm,” he said. People are currently waiting about an hour to eat at the cafe, he said. And restaurants that do take reservations are often booked, sometimes for weeks in advance. The owners of Sale Pepe restaurant appreciate the safety measures. “We need to be safe,” owner and chef Michele Di Bari said. “People think it’s over, especially people who are coming on vacation.” The restaurant is booked until the end of the month and has increased its takeout and delivery business. “We always remember that this is a temporary situation,” owner and general manager Qiana Di Bari said. “It’s uncomfortable right now. ... We just have to hang in there.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state could finish the fiscal year at the end of June with a record budget surplus of $800 million, Gov. Brad Little announced Wednesday. The Republican governor said he will advocate for additional tax cuts along with investments in key areas, with education topping the priority list. Lawmakers will take up the budget when they meet in January. Little said fiscal conservatism, swift action during the coronavirus pandemic, responsible allocation of billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 rescue money and “our relentless focus on cutting red tape are the reasons Idaho’s economy is catapulting ahead of other states right now.” Little noted that May revenue numbers came in $580 million ahead of forecasts and, at nearly $850 million, the best in state history. The Division of Financial Management said revenue numbers for May, also released Wednesday, were far above predictions because the deadline for paying income tax was delayed from April to May due to the pandemic. Overall this year, individual income taxes have brought in $2.3 billion, about 25% more than predicted. Sales tax collections are up nearly 8% to $1.8 billion.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: State lawmakers could take up a bill later this month that would restore voting rights to convicted offenders serving time in county jails or state or federal prisons, according to the measure’s House sponsor. Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, said the bill almost came up for a vote during the final days of the regular session but was delayed due to some last-minute confusion. Lawmakers wrapped up the bulk of their spring session June 1, but they did not formally adjourn the session because negotiations were continuing on a massive energy bill that would put Illinois on a path to producing 100% of its electricity from renewable and carbon-free sources. The Senate plans to return next Tuesday to vote on the energy bill, with the House in session the following day. Ford’s proposal to restore voting rights to convicted inmates was the subject of a committee hearing in March, but the panel never voted on it. During that hearing, Rep. Patrick Windhorst, R-Metropolis, questioned whether it would require a constitutional amendment before it could take effect because the Illinois Constitution states: “A person convicted of a felony, or otherwise under sentence in a correctional institution or jail, shall lose the right to vote, which right shall be restored not later than upon completion of his sentence.”\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: When muscle is damaged, resident stem cells mediate the repair of the injured tissue. At the same time, circulating immune cells race to the site to aid the repair. The presence of these infiltrating immune cells at injury sites raises questions about their role in coordinating with muscle stem cells to build or regenerate muscle tissue. Shihuan Kuang, a Purdue professor of animal sciences, has identified a previously unknown subset of muscle stem cells, which he has dubbed “immunomyoblasts,” that have both muscle stem cell and immune cell properties and may shed light on how those cells interact. The National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases recently awarded Kuang $2.3 million over five years to develop a basic understanding of these cells’ origins and functions. “These stem cells have unique properties that raise questions about where they come from and how they relate to muscle and immune cells,” Kuang said. “This grant will provide the support for us to answer those fundamental questions and lay a foundation for applied research into ways immunomyoblasts could be targeted to treat diseases and improve animal agriculture.” The knowledge gained from Kuang’s work may open new avenues of research in muscular diseases.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Residents will no longer be able to use a state website to check their own vaccination histories or those of their children. The Iowa Department of Public Health is limiting public access to the website, partly because of concerns that employers could surreptitiously use it to see if their workers have been inoculated, department spokeswoman Sarah Ekstrand said. The change comes amid national controversy over whether employers should be able to require workers to receive COVID-19 shots and a state law banning use or government issuance of so-called vaccine passports. Hospitals, clinics and pharmacies have long been required to record vaccinations on the Iowa Immunization Registry Information System, which helps tracking of vaccination efforts, including in communities and for schools’ students. The website also lets health care providers check before administering a vaccine to see if patients have already received the shots elsewhere. Since 2012, individual Iowans could sign on to IRIS using their names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers or Medicaid numbers to view their own vaccination histories, Ekstrand said. They also could check their children’s records that way. But Ekstrand said legislators heard concerns that employers or others with access to that information could access the records.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Eastern Kansas and western Missouri are facing a “blood emergency,” the Community Blood Center of Greater Kansas City announced Wednesday. The nonprofit organization asked the public to donate blood to help replenish its supply, which it said was only sufficient to last three days. Things were looking “a little bit grim” in terms of the lack of blood donations being made to the donor center the CBC operates in southwest Topeka, said Chelsey Smith, the CBC’s outreach and communications coordinator. The situation is similar at the six other centers operated by the CBC, Smith said. The blood shortage was triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the center. Smith said while figures weren’t available for specific locations, about 25,000 people who had been blood donors prior to the pandemic had not yet returned to donate in the greater Kansas City area alone. Meanwhile, Smith said, the CBC was seeing virtually no first-time donors among youths, while the number of blood drives being held had been reduced by hundreds. “Complicating matters, there has been a recent surge in blood usage as hospitals perform surgeries and patients seek medical care that was postponed during the pandemic,” the CBC said. “The increased need and lag in donors has created a chronic gap in blood donations.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A former nurse at a nursing home claims in a lawsuit that she was fired last year after raising repeated concerns about infection control and lack of personal protective equipment, such as masks, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Donna Frank, a registered nurse, alleges in the lawsuit filed June 3 that she was wrongly fired by Signature Healthcare at Jefferson Place Rehab and Wellness Center after about six months on the job. Frank was fired Sept. 9, 2020, the day after an investigator from the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services Office of Inspector General showed up to investigate conditions at Signature-Jefferson Place, following a complaint from Frank. The lawsuit alleges she was fired in retaliation for that and other complaints related to COVID-19 and infection control procedures. “The more she complained, the more of a headache she became, and they just got rid of her,” said Frank’s lawyer, Charles W. Miller. A spokeswoman for Signature Healthcare, Ann Bowdan Wilder, said in an email that the company doesn’t comment on pending legal matters but that “there are two sides to every story and judgement or opinion should be withheld until allegations are proven and/or disproven in the legal process.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: All 5-year-old children in the state should receive a kindergarten education, lawmakers decided Wednesday. With one day remaining in the legislative session, lawmakers sent the measure by Sen. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, to the governor’s desk. The Senate voted 38-0 for the final version of the legislation, while the House backed it in a 70-32 vote. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has said he supports the bill and will sign it into law. The requirement, to take effect with the 2022-23 school year, is estimated to add up to 2,800 students to kindergarten rolls when the mandate starts. Louisiana children currently must attend school from the ages of 7 to 18, unless they graduate early from high school. Fields’ bill will require kindergarten attendance for children who turn 5 years old by Sept. 30 of each year. A parent can defer the kindergarten enrollment if the child is 4 years old on the first day of school or if the child is enrolled in a pre-K program. Supporters said mandatory kindergarten will help to keep children from falling behind, noting that studies show 90% of brain development happens between birth and age 5. They said 19 other states require mandatory kindergarten, and Southern states with the requirement have higher literacy rates than Louisiana.\n\nMaine\n\nWells: Scientists have determined that a black substance that had settled near the shoreline over several days is made up of millions of dead bugs. One of the regulars who walk Wells Beach, Ed Smith, took photos of the substance in the sand and sent them to the state Department of Environmental Protection, the Portland Press Herald reports. Smith wanted to know more because he said his feet were dyed black after walking through it, and he wanted to know if it was possibly toxic. Steve Dickson, a marine geologist with Maine Geological Survey, figured out what was going on with the help of two retired oceanographers who live nearby. One of them, Linda Stathoplos, took a sample from the beach and looked at it under her microscope. “It was clearly little bugs,” Stathoplos said. “This is the first time I’ve seen or heard of this in my 35 years,” Dickson said, adding that he is still trying to determine what the bugs are, where they came from and why. But he does not expect it to be a regular occurrence.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: A controversy surrounding the placement of a 149-foot-tall Ferris wheel seems to have reached a conclusion after an amusement park informed town officials that it will move its ride off town property, but with the cost of a fix estimated to top $100,000, the Big Wheel won’t operate this summer. Ocean City leaders ordered Trimper’s Rides to move its Ferris wheel off the Boardwalk on Monday night. Questions about the structure’s proximity to the town-owned Boardwalk arose over the weekend, and the encroachment was confirmed Monday when a survey paid for by Trimper’s found it overhung town property by at least 10 feet. Park officials told the town it will dismantle the ride Monday, said Jessica Waters, communications and marketing director for Ocean City. The Big Wheel has been shut down, according to Waters, but the town will continue to issue fines for the zoning violation until it’s off the Boardwalk. Trimper’s had received at least three fines from Ocean City from Saturday through Monday, she said Tuesday. Each fine was $500, and Waters said it can be increased up to $1,000 each day until the ride is moved. Trimper’s President Antoinette Bruno has said the incorrect placement was the result of human error: “I think we made an error of a few inches, and we’re sorry.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Roman Catholics across the state are being called back to Sunday Mass. Cardinal Sean O’Malley of the Archdiocese of Boston and the bishops of Springfield and Fall River announced in similar statements Wednesday that the faithful are once again required to attend Mass starting the weekend of June 19-20. Houses of worship have either been closed or open under capacity limits for the past year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and services have either been broadcast or held remotely. O’Malley said Father’s Day was an appropriate time to lift the dispensation. “In this year of Saint Joseph, who was always a faithful observer of the sabbath, we chose Father’s Day as an appropriate day to encourage all of our people, and especially our families, to return to the Sunday celebration of the Eucharist,” he said in his letter to parishioners. Mass is a central part of being Catholic, Springfield Bishop William Byrne said. “The benefit of that is every time we go to Mass, we encounter Jesus Christ, we get to be together, we get to celebrate the obligation and the goodness of keeping the sabbath holy,” he said. The obligation to attend Mass does not apply to those who are ill or homebound, the bishops said. Worcester Bishop Robert McManus restored the Mass obligation for his parishioners last month.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Wednesday that makes it easier for veterans and their families who are licensed professionals to continue their careers when they move to the state. Veterans, active-duty service members and their dependents with valid out-of-state professional licenses can get their licenses in Michigan under the new laws, and the fees for application will be waived. Current law allows veterans to have the initial application fees for professional licenses waived, but the new law expands that waiver to active-duty service members and their dependents. The families of the 550,000 veterans in Michigan face enough struggles seeking employment after service without having to figure out how to get re-licensed when they have a valid out-of-state license, Zeneta Adams, director of the Michigan Veterans Affairs Agency, said Wednesday at a bill signing in Lansing. Whitmer said the bill will help welcome service members and their families to Michigan and promote a skilled workforce, helping the state achieve its goal of raising the number of people with a professional certificate or college degree to 60% by 2030, up from the current 49%. The measure received bipartisan support in the Legislature.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A federal judge has sentenced a man to 15 months in prison for killing and then beheading a 700-pound black bear on the Red Lake Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota. U.S. District Judge Susan Richard Nelson sentenced 39-year-old James Stimac on Wednesday. The bear is one of seven clan animals of the Red Lake Band of Chippewa. The tribe doesn’t allow non-Indians to hunt bear on its reservation. According to prosecutors, Stimac, of Brainerd, isn’t a Red Lake tribal member and entered the northern Minnesota reservation without permission in September 2019. He used a compound bow to shoot and kill the bear near the reservation’s garbage dump. He returned to the dump the next day and posed for photographs with the carcass. He later posted the photos on social media. The bear was too big to move, so he sawed its head off and took it to a taxidermist in Ironton to make it into a trophy. He left the remainder of the carcass to rot.\n\nMississippi\n\nPascagoula: A shipyard that’s the largest private employer in the state says it plans to hire about 3,000 new full-time employees. Ingalls Shipbuilding held a hiring event Wednesday in Pascagoula. Its parent company, Huntington Ingalls Industries, said in a news release that it has been recruiting potential workers in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana. “We are steadily adding new team members to our growing workforce,” Ingalls Shipbuilding President Kari Wilkinson said in the release. “Shipbuilding is a challenging, extremely rewarding and potentially life-changing career.” Ingalls is hiring ship fitters, electricians, pipefitters, pipe welders and structural welders. It is seeking people with mechanical, hot work or carpentry experience. The news release said free training is available to those without the required skills or work experience. The shipyard recently finished improvements that include more than a million square feet of covered work area, better access to work sites and tool rooms, cool-down and hydration stations, and a second dining area, the news release said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A union representing state workers is urging Gov. Mike Parson to make accommodations for employees ordered last month to return to their offices, calling the directive “dangerous.” The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports Natashia Pickens, president of the Missouri State Workers Union Communications Workers of America Local 6355, wrote to Parson on Wednesday, saying that COVID-19 is still “raging” across the state and that Parson’s office failed to take into account health or child care concerns. The union asked that Parson, a Republican, consider demands that include paid time off to get vaccinated, personal protective equipment for employees, and that the state set up a process so workers with family and child care responsibilities may request a delayed return. Thirty-one House Democrats signed onto the letter. Last month Parson directed all state employees to return to in-person work after many spent most of the previous 14 months working remotely. He cited declining cases of COVID-19.\n\nMontana\n\nNye: Two workers for the only palladium and platinum mining operation in the U.S. have died in an underground accident at a mine, company officials said. The employees were in a utility vehicle called a side-by-side that crashed into an underground locomotive Wednesday afternoon, said Heather McDowell, a vice president with the South Africa-based Sibanye-Stillwater, which owns the Stillwater Mining Co. The cause of the accident at the mine near the community of Nye, north of Yellowstone National Park, is under investigation. Mine officials said they are working with safety regulators. The identities of the workers were not made public. In a statement, company officials said that “we value safety above all else. Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone impacted by this tragic event.” Stillwater Mining Co. has 2,335 employees and contractors, according to its website, including just over 1,200 workers at the mine in Nye, McDowell said. Its other palladium and platinum mine is near the small Montana city of Big Timber, and the company has a refining complex in the nearby town of Columbus.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state continues to report only a small number of new COVID-19 cases, but that number crept up slightly over the past week. Health officials said Nebraska recorded 280 new coronavirus cases over the past week, up from 237 the week before. But as recently as April, the state was reporting more cases than that in a single day. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska fell over the past two weeks, going from 74.43 new cases per day May 25 to 40.00 new cases per day Tuesday. The state said 54 people were hospitalized with the virus across Nebraska on Wednesday. That number has been below 100 since the middle of May, and it is a fraction of the November peak of 987. Gov. Pete Ricketts ended the last of the state’s virus-related restrictions last month because hospitalizations remain at such a low level. The state has now confirmed a total of 223,749 virus cases and 2,256 deaths since the pandemic began. Roughly 44.5% of the state’s population has been vaccinated against COVID-19, but health officials said the pace of vaccinations has slowed significantly over the past month.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Gov. Steve Sisolak on Wednesday signed into law a bill that paves the way for Nevada to become the second state in the nation, after Washington, to offer state-managed health insurance plans. Sisolak signed the measure that seeks to create state-managed health insurance plans by 2026 at a Las Vegas medical center. It passed through the Legislature on May 30. The new law requires insurers that bid to cover Medicaid recipients and state employees to also bid to offer a so-called public option plan. State officials would select certain providers to be in-network for the public option plan and mandate that they charge 5% less in monthly premiums than the average plan on the state insurance marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act and 15% less by four years after it is first offered. Proponents argue a state-based public option will expand coverage to Nevada’s 350,000 uninsured residents and lower the cost of health insurance throughout the market. The bill’s detractors decry the price controls and worry that forcing doctors and hospitals to accept patients at lower costs could lead them to leave the state and exacerbate a practitioner shortage. The public option plan will have to undergo an actuarial study, and then the state would need to apply for a waiver from the federal government.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill seeking justice for run-over cats is heading to the governor’s desk, minus the name of the animal that inspired it. State law already requires drivers who injure or kill dogs to notify police or the animals’ owners, or else face a $1,000 fine, but Rep. Daryl Abbas, R-Salem, sponsored a bill to give cats equal footing after the death of his 5-year-old cat, Arrow. The House passed the bill in April, as did the Senate, but the latter objected to dubbing it “Arrow’s Law.” The House agreed Thursday to drop the name and advance the bill to Gov. Chris Sununu, who has said he will sign it. Rep. Thomas Walsh, chair of the House Transportation Committee, urged his colleagues to support the bill despite the change. “While we will always remember Arrow, there was no objection from the committee,” said Walsh, R-Hooksett. In any state, hitting an animal with a car could be a potential violation as destruction of property, but animal advocates say the New Hampshire bill is part of a trend of states going further. In Massachusetts, the law includes cats and dogs. New York requires drivers to report injuries to dogs, cats, horses or cattle. And Rhode Island’s statute covers all domesticated animals.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Surf shops have been swamped with both new and veteran surfers searching for a safe, socially distanced activity during a pandemic, along with the exhilaration that comes with the sport. Now, surfboard manufacturers racing to meet the demand can’t keep up. Surfers are waiting longer and paying more. Melissa D’Anna opened Lucky Dog Surf Co. in Sea Bright in 2017, helping the township recover from superstorm Sandy, and she quickly built a following. She worried the pandemic would put a stop to her momentum. But the surfing industry, estimated by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Assocation to generate upward of $8 billion a year, found itself with a nearly perfect set of circumstances. Some people with vacation homes at the Shore moved there full time and could surf after work. Others had federal relief checks that they could spend on new hobbies. Surfers said they began to see their tight-knit community expand. “You saw people you hadn’t seen out the water in a while,” said Mickey Schluter, a 23-year-old surfer from Fair Haven. Local manufacturers said orders for boards spiked, forcing them to scramble to fill them. Brian Wynn, owner of Wynn Surfboards in Egg Harbor Township, said he’s about two months behind schedule.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state’s top information technology official says a new $100 million state account for expanding access to high-speed internet is just a start, and investments of $1 billion are likely needed to modernize infrastructure. Information Technology Secretary John Salazar told a panel of legislators Thursday that international consultant Deloitte is helping the state anticipate opportunities for federal grant money to improve internet access and data transfer rates. “They’re scoping out those grants,” he said. “We need to be up there, front and center, asking for the money.” Salazar said the consultant is also looking at internet infrastructure programs in seven comparable states for effective solutions. He said states like Colorado, Minnesota and Montana have some things in common with New Mexico in terms of geography and obligations to Native American communities. The COVID-19 pandemic and a yearlong pivot to online learning have exposed gaps in internet access across swaths of the state. Over 20% of students were left without internet at home at the start of the pandemic, and a state district court judge has directed the state to move quickly on improvements for pupils.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The traditional Macy’s Fourth of July fireworks show will return to the city this year after the pandemic forced changes to the celebration in 2020, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. “This is really great, a tremendous sign of the rebirth of New York City,” de Blasio said at a virtual briefing. The fireworks will be launched from five barges in the East River starting at 9:25 p.m. July 4, said Will Coss, executive producer of the show. The show will be broadcast live on NBC as part of a two-hour special featuring the Black Pumas, Coldplay, OneRepublic and Reba McEntire, officials from Macy’s and NBC said. The big show was replaced by several small, unannounced fireworks displays last year in order to prevent crowds from gathering during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. De Blasio said there will be dedicated areas for fully vaccinated people to enjoy this year’s show, along with other areas for people who are not vaccinated or who want to join together with people who are not vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislation that includes $2 billion in income tax reductions over the next two years and the phaseout of the state’s corporate income tax by 2028 received bipartisan approval again in the Senate on Thursday. The Republican-authored measure, which also would send up to $1 billion in federal COVID-19 recovery aid to hundreds of thousands of businesses and nonprofits, already received the Senate’s initial OK on Wednesday. Seven Democrats joined all Republicans present in voting 34-13 for the bill Thursday. The bill now heads to the House, where action isn’t expected. Rather, the Senate will insert the package in its state government budget plan later this month and negotiate it with the House after that chamber approves a competing tax and spending proposal. The Senate plan would reduce the individual income tax rate of 5.25% to 4.99% next year and increase the amount of income not subject to taxes for all filers by increasing the standard and per-child deductions. The corporate rate – at 2.5%, currently the lowest among those states that have such a tax – would start falling in 2024. Democrats opposing the bill say it would give tax breaks to out-of-state corporations and high wage-earners who don’t need them.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: Firefighters found themselves battling a string of dumpster fires on the city’s southern edge late Tuesday. The fire department said in a news release that the first call came in at 10:50 p.m. A half-hour later, firefighters responded to another dumpster fire at a different location. Three minutes later, they responded to three dumpster fires at the same location. The department said the fires are considered suspicious given the timing and proximity to one another.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has come out against a controversial bill that would weaken the state’s vaccination laws and grant more individual freedom. DeWine asked Ohioans to think of the impact vaccines have had on society. “Before modern medicine, diseases such as mumps, polio, whooping cough were common and caused great, great, great suffering and death to thousands of people every single year,” DeWine said during a news conference Thursday. A 1955 newspaper photo surfaced recently showing DeWine becoming one of the first second graders in Yellow Springs, Ohio, to get a polio vaccine. Hearings on House Bill 248 have drawn national attention as advocates have spread misinformation and conspiracies. Testimony from Dr. Sherri Tenpenny and nurse Joanna Overholt drew widespread derision and mockery. “I’m sure you’ve seen the pictures all over the internet of people who have had these shots, and now they’re magnetized,” Tenpenny said. “You can put a key on their forehead; it sticks. You can put spoons and forks all over, and they can stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that.” Later, there was some show-and-tell. “Explain to me why the key sticks to me. It sticks to my neck too,” Overholt said as a key failed to stick to her neck. Tenpenny also mentioned the false claim that the COVID-19 vaccine contains particles that can connect with 5G wireless technology.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Workers began excavating remains of possible Tulsa Race Massacre victims this week, removing them from a cemetery where searchers have found at least 27 bodies, according to Oklahoma State Archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck. The 1921 massacre occurred when a white mob descended on the Black section of Tulsa – Greenwood – and burned more than 1,000 homes, looted hundreds of others and destroyed its thriving business district. Most historians who have studied the event estimate the death toll to be between 75 and 300. The remains that have been found will be transferred for examinations led by forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield. Both Stackelbeck and Tulsa Mass Graves Investigation Public Oversight Committee Chairman Kavin Ross said it’s possible the remains are from people who died from other things, such as the Spanish flu pandemic that killed an estimated 7,350 in Oklahoma in 1918 and 1919. The search began last year, and researchers in October found at least 12 sets of remains, although the remains were covered back up at that time for further study. Stackelbeck has estimated more than 30 bodies could be in the site. Searches of two other sites are planned.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly six months after a Republican legislator let violent, far-right protesters into the state Capitol, a special committee will examine his role and could recommend he be the first member of the House to be expelled in its 160-year history. Ahead of the panel’s inaugural meeting Monday afternoon, more than 200 people sent written testimony. Some excoriated Rep. Mike Nearman as a seditionist. Others praised him for letting people into the Capitol on Dec. 21, 2020, when it was closed to the public because of coronavirus safety protocols, saying people should be allowed to attend even though hearings are livestreamed on video. “Mike Nearman’s behavior … was abhorrent and anti-democratic,” David Alba wrote to the committee. “Furthermore, by aiding and supporting extremists, he has placed people’s lives in danger. He should be removed from office and he is not fit to represent my district.” After video emerged in local news reports Friday showing Nearman choreographing how he would let protesters into the Capitol, pinpointing the door he would open for them and disclosing his cellphone number so protesters could text him, every other Republican member of the House on Monday strongly recommended he step down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An ambitious Republican proposal to revamp state election law was unveiled Thursday – a 149-page bill that would change deadlines, adopt new rules for early voting, alter mail-in ballot procedures and mandate IDs for all in-person voters. The measure produced by State Government Committee Chairman Seth Grove is likely to encounter severe pushback from Democrats in a state where both parties are competitive in statewide races. Although Pennsylvania’s closely watched 2020 election was carried out smoothly, many Republicans have called for election-law changes in the wake of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims of widespread voting fraud. “This is not a view of the Republicans or the Democrats,” said Grove, R-York, whose committee conducted hearings on the topic this spring. “This is a view of what we heard through 10 extensive hearings from all sides.” The bill was introduced by Grove and House Republican leaders with just three weeks left before lawmakers are due to wrap up business and head home for the summer. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Lyndsay Kensinger, said the bill aimed to install new barriers against voting, in effect silencing people’s voices and turning ballot access into a political weapon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A trip to the beach this weekend could come with immunity benefits. The state Department of Environmental Management and the state Department of Health are partnering to host a free COVID-19 vaccination clinic at Misquamicut State Beach in Westerly starting at 11 a.m. Saturday, officials said in a statement. The clinic – which will offer the one shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine – is open to beach employees and visitors, and state residents and nonresidents alike are eligible. People getting a shot must be 18 or older. The vaccine is free, but normal parking fees will still apply, officials said. There are just 37 people in Rhode Island’s hospitals with confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to the latest data released Thursday by the Department of Health – the lowest single-day total since the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. Of those patients, five are in intensive care and on ventilators. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state peaked at more than 500 in December. Rhode Island also reported about 40 newly confirmed cases, for a daily positivity rate of 0.7%, and no new virus-related deaths. Nearly 585,000 people in the state have now been fully vaccinated against the disease, according to agency data.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a law requiring sex offenders to register for life, without prior judicial review, is unconstitutional. In a unanimous ruling, justices wrote that the “requirement that sex offenders must register for life without any opportunity for judicial review violates due process because it is arbitrary and cannot be deemed rationally related to the General Assembly’s stated purpose of protecting the public from those with a high risk of re-offending.” Justices set a 12-month timeline to implement the ruling, to give state lawmakers time to “correct the deficiency in the statute regarding judicial review.” The case stems from a lawsuit originally brought by Dennis Powell, who was arrested in 2008 for criminal solicitation of a minor after authorities said he had graphic online conversations with someone who he thought was a 12-year-old girl but who was actually an undercover officer. After pleading guilty, Powell was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to register as a sex offender, which South Carolina’s statute mandates as a lifelong situation. South Carolina’s sex offender statute requires biannual registration in person at a sheriff’s office but provides for no periodic review by a judge, a situation the court called “the most stringent in the country.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union that had threatened a strike at a Smithfield pork processing plant says it has reached a tentative agreement with the company on a four-year contract. The Sioux Falls chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers had negotiated with Virginia-based Smithfield Foods for two days after union members rejected a previous contract proposal and authorized a strike. Union leaders said its members will vote on the proposed contract next week. The agreement appeared to assuage the possibility of a strike at the plant, which produces nearly 5% of the nation’s pork every day. UFCW said in a statement late Wednesday that the company dropped plans to take away a 15-minute break, and “the parties have reached an agreement on wages.” The union had pressed for Smithfield to boost pay from a proposed base wage of $18 an hour, as well as to keep a break during the second half of worker shifts. Smithfield has said that its initial proposal would have still ensured two 15-minute breaks for employees who work eight-hour shifts and that the company’s offer was “in full alignment” with agreements that the UFCW accepted at other locations.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: A former governor’s administration helped fund a contract murder of a key federal witness decades ago while embroiled in the state’s largest political scandal, law enforcement officials announced Wednesday. The new details revealed for the first time Wednesday have elements that ring of a movie: a trusted ally of union boss Jimmy Hoffa gunned down after testifying about a corrupt governor selling prison pardons and a gunman who donned a wig and blackface to throw authorities off the scent. Investigators in Hamilton County have been chipping away at the 42-year-old cold case of Samuel Pettyjohn since they renewed their investigation in 2015. No new charges will be filed because all of the major players involved are now dead, but authorities say closing the case provides closure to one aspect of a complicated piece of Tennessee history. Pettyjohn, a Chattanooga businessman and close friend of Hoffa, was fatally shot in 1979 in downtown Chattanooga after testifying before a federal grand jury during the early phases of Tennessee’s notorious “cash-for-clemency” scandal. The scandal ultimately led to the ousting of Democratic Gov. Ray Blanton, who was never indicted, but three of his aides were. However, questions have lingered about the extent to which the governor’s administration actively worked to thwart the investigation. Officials say at least five witnesses in the case were murdered or killed themselves.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: The El Paso Museum of Archaeology will reopen June 24, city officials announced Wednesday. The COVID-19 pandemic forced the museum to close in March 2020, but under the advisement of the Department of Public Health and the Office of Emergency Management, visitors will once again be able to learn about the Indigenous history along the Rio Grande Valley. “The reopening of the Museum of Archaeology along with the opening of the Camp Cohen Water Park are great illustrators of our commitment to enhancing the quality of life in Northeast El Paso and for all El Pasoans,” said Cultural Affairs and Recreation Managing Director Ben Fyffe. The museum will be open with free admission from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday through Saturday. Upon opening, visitors can experience the exhibit “From the Edge of Center: The Chacoan Outliers.” The museum will showcase many artifacts from its permanent collection, as well as artifacts on loan from the Salmon Ruins near Farmington, New Mexico, and the San Juan County Museum Association. The El Paso Museum of Archaeology highlights 14,000 years of prehistory in the area, the greater Southwest and northern Mexico. The museum also features nature trails on 15 acres of land and an American Indian Garden.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s congressional delegation on Wednesday requested a meeting with President Joe Biden before he makes his final decision on whether the boundaries of two sprawling national monuments in Utah should be restored. The delegation of Republicans sent a letter to Biden in which they also requested that Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s full report be made available to Congress. “It is past time to end the political back-and-forth that the communities in our state have been subjected to for more than 25 years, and you have a historic opportunity to do so by working with Congress,” the letter said. Haaland made her recommendation about whether to reverse former President Donald Trump’s decision to downsize Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante last week, but details of her decision were not released. The Interior Department gave her report to Biden on June 2, according to a court filing Thursday in a legal battle that began more than three years ago after Trump’s decision. U.S. Department of Justice attorneys mentioned the report as part of a request to have until July 13 to address the judge’s question about whether the legal battle has become a moot point.\n\nVermont\n\nMarlboro: The ongoing ownership dispute over the former Marlboro College campus has prompted the organizers of a music festival to offer to front the costs of campus maintenance this summer. The Marlboro School of Music asked a court Wednesday to allow it to temporarily pay for campus upkeep so that its annual music festival, which is held there over 10 weeks, can move forward, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. Marlboro College merged with Emerson College in Massachusetts and finalized the sale of its campus in July 2020 to a nonprofit group, Democracy Builders. But there is now a dispute about whether Democracy Builders owns the campus or whether another group, Type I Civilization Academy, holds the deed. A judge for Windham Superior Court ruled that the music school may place its $250,000 rent payment in escrow. The estimated maintenance costs could be $1 million, the newspaper reports. In court, the parties agreed to review the maintenance expenses paid by the School of Music at the end of the summer and then determine what should happen to the escrowed rent and what expenses might need to be reimbursed to the music school by the rightful owner, whoever that might be.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A city engineer who fatally shot 12 people in a Virginia Beach municipal building in 2019 “was motivated by perceived workplace grievances” that “he fixated on for years,” according to findings released by the FBI on Wednesday. The investigation, conducted by the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, found that DeWayne Craddock “struggled with how he perceived his own work performance and how others at work viewed him.” “The shooter’s inflated sense of self-importance contributed to this conflict and led him to believe he was unjustly and repeatedly criticized and slighted,” the FBI said in a news release. “Violence was viewed by the shooter as a way to reconcile this conflict and restore his perverted view of justice.” But the FBI cautioned that no person or group was in a position to “see the confluence of behaviors that may have forewarned the attack” because Craddock had purposely isolated himself and disengaged from his relationships. The agency also said that Craddock suffered from significant mental health stressors, although they “alone cannot explain the Virginia Beach attack.” The FBI’s findings appear to go a step further than two previous investigations into the mass shooting in the coastal city of nearly half a million people. Virginia Beach police said in March that they could not determine a motive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A pet dog who vanished for two days after being ejected from a vehicle during a car accident has been found apparently doing the job it was bred to do – herding sheep. Linda Oswald’s family and their dog, Tilly, were driving along Idaho State Highway 41 on Sunday when they crashed into another car, launching the dog through the rear window, The Spokesman-Review reports. The unharmed but stunned dog then ran away, prompting an immediate search with at least six complete strangers who witnessed the crash and pulled over along the highway to help, Oswald said. “People just kept going out,” she said, noting that the search lasted about 10 hours Sunday before the family went home. “We were sore and exhausted.” Oswald said the family then wrote a Facebook post that included a picture of the 2-year-old border collie and red heeler mix, and more than 3,000 people shared the post. That’s when Tyler, Travis and Zane Potter recognized the dog in the photo as the same dog they saw on their family farm south of Rathdrum on Tuesday. Both the Potters and Oswald think Tilly was drawn to the farm and their sheep. “I think that dog was trying to herd,” Travis Potter said. Oswald said if it weren’t for the post, he would still be out there.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two newly dedicated state offices will deal with child welfare and family assistance. The state is creating a Bureau for Social Services and a Bureau for Family Assistance and Supports to streamline its handling of child welfare, The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington reports. Their staff will continue operating under the Department of Health and Human Resources. Both bureaus will be tailored to their mission, and the changes will take place in July. They were previously within the Bureau for Children and Families. Cammie Chapman, counsel for the Department of Health and Human Resources, detailed the changes to a legislative commission Tuesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Jim Doyle and Scott Walker don’t agree on much, but the former governors are joining together to call for people to get COVID-19 vaccines in a new public service television advertisement. The spot released Thursday, produced by UW Health, features Walker, a Republican, placing a Zoom call to Doyle, a Democrat. Both are in their personal offices and never appear in the same room together. “I’m just ready to be done with this pandemic,” Walker says. Doyle responds: “I couldn’t agree with you more.” “That’s what I thought,” Walker says. “Here’s another thought: Let’s do a commercial together – reminding people in Wisconsin how important it is to be vaccinated.” Doyle quips: “That may be the best idea you’ve ever had.” Both Walker and Doyle have been vaccinated. Both governors said in statements that they hoped the ad would encourage everyone to get vaccinated to enjoy the summer and return to a more normal life. “It just makes sense,” Walker said Thursday on Twitter in response to a post about the ad. A third former governor, current interim University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson, wielded a sledgehammer in a series of videos last year urging people to “smash COVID.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon has announced that up to $12 million of the remaining $67 million of coronavirus relief money sent to the state will be allocated toward oil and gas projects through the Energy Rebound Program. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission will accept applications for funding from June 15 through June 25, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Energy Rebound Program, which was launched in November, was created to boost the state’s oil and gas industry as it recovers from an economic decline by using federal aid as an incentive to push efforts to create jobs and stimulate the economy in Wyoming instead of in other states. “This is about trying to keep jobs in Wyoming,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming spokesman Ryan McConnaughey said, noting that projects will still need large investments because of a $500,000 cap on each project of the $12 million. The program was initially allocated $15 million from the federal government, but Gordon doubled the amount – all of which was awarded, governor’s office spokesman Michael Pearlman said. The Wyoming Business Council estimated that the last round of program projects will receive more than $150 million in oil and natural gas in 2021.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/02/space-dummy-bigfoot-denial-pumped-pumpkin-news-around-states/40064849/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: A new golden eagle will be joining Auburn University’s avian air force. Aurea joins the bald eagle Spirit. The pair will soar over Jordan-Hare Stadium before home games, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. Aurea was brought to the Southeastern Raptor Center in Auburn’s College of Veterinary Medicine in 2016, after being found near Selma, Alabama, with an injury to her right wing. Auburn veterinarians brought her back to good health, but the aftermath of the injury causes her to have more drag during flights. “Her flight stamina isn’t quite good enough for her to be released into the wild, but it doesn’t affect her flying in the stadium because she’s not chasing a live animal,” says Andrew Hopkins, assistant director of raptor training and education at the Southeastern Raptor Center.\n\nAlaska\n\nPalmer: Dale Marshall of Anchorage broke his previous state record by nearly 600 pounds when the pumpkin he entered this year tipped the scale at 2,051 pounds during last week’s Alaska State Fair weigh-off. “It was mind-blowing,” Marshall says. “I wasn’t even thinking 2,000 pounds. I thought it would weigh between 1,700 and 1,900 pounds using the tape measure method. In pumpkin-growing land around the world, that is an elite club to grow 2,000. Nobody has grown a pumpkin this size this far north in the world.” Marshall says he thinks weather was a big factor this year. “With all the sunny days, I got plenty of heat in the greenhouse. The pumpkin is 89 days old. Nothing happens the first days. In 79 days, it grew to 2,051 pounds. That’s an average of 25 pounds per day. It grew 50 pounds a day in parts of July.”\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Historians, archivists and librarians in northern Arizona are teaming up to protect artifacts in the event of a disaster. The Northern Arizona Cultural Heritage Preservation Initiative includes organizations like Cline Library at Northern Arizona University, the Museum of Northern Arizona, the Arizona Historical Society Pioneer Museum, Lowell Observatory and Flagstaff Public Library. The Arizona Daily Sun reports the group has met quarterly for the past year to begin conversations in order to formalize the disaster support partnerships that have existed among them for years. Cline Library’s special collections area holds more than 2 million items, including handwritten ledgers from the Babbitt Brother Trading Co., invoices from the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company, and other material dating back to the 1850s.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two newspapers in the state are scheduled to shut down this week. The Stuttgart Daily Leader and the Helena-West Helena World each report they will publish their final editions Sept. 6, then be closed by Gatehouse Media. Gatehouse regional vice president Matt Guthrie says the company “is enthusiastically working with an interested party” for possible sale of the Stuttgart newspaper and will work with anyone interested in the Helena-West Helena publication. Gatehouse Media last month announced plans to purchase USA TODAY owner Gannett in an estimated $1.4 billion deal. In recent weeks it was reported Gatehouse has laid off more than two dozen journalists and other workers at 10 newspapers it owns across the nation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Those body-length receipts from retail stores are here to stay. A bill before the Legislature would have banned paper receipts unless requested by a customer. But a legislative committee voted Friday not to send the legislation to the Senate floor for a vote. The move means the bill is unlikely to pass this year. California has been a trailblazer for environmental regulations, becoming the first state to adopt a cap-and-trade system to reduce carbon emissions from the state’s biggest polluters. The state bans plastic straws at full-service restaurants unless requested by customers. This year, lawmakers have advanced a bill that would ban hotels from providing small plastic bottles for shampoo and other toiletries. But banning those thin, crinkly, coupon-filled receipts appears to be a step too far, even for California.\n\nColorado\n\nCortez: The state’s drivers and passengers are using seat belts more often. A Department of Transportation survey shows 88% of Coloradoans report using seat belts, up from 86% in 2018 and 60% in 1997. The Cortez Journal reports the national rate for seat belt use is 90%. People in sport-utility vehicles have Colorado’s highest rate of seat-belt use, 92%. About 83% of people in pickup trucks and 76% of those in commercial vehicles use seat belts. Unbuckled motorists accounted for 220 of the 416 deaths on Colorado roads in 2018.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Author Wally Lamb says he’s eager to get his writing program for female prisoners back up and running after state officials cleared him of wrongdoing alleged by two former inmates. Lamb said in an email to the Associated Press that he understood prison officials had to perform due diligence. He said inmates still in the program deny the allegations made by two former offenders. They had claimed they haven’t been paid for their contributions to Lamb’s planned third anthology of female prisoner writings. A lawsuit by one of them, Chandra Bozelko, remains pending. Department of Correction officials reinstated the program Thursday. Bozelko claims prison investigators did not contact key witnesses or gather all the facts. Lamb is the author of “I Know This Much Is True,” which HBO is turning into a series.\n\nDelaware\n\nRockland: Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children welcomed a few hundred painted ladies last week. The bright orange-black-and-white butterflies are the focus of a new garden at the pediatric hospital in Rockland. The fuzzy little creatures were released Wednesday morning as part of a project from Greenville teen Kendra Kaericher to give back to her community. The senior got a grant from St. Paul’s School, her New Hampshire boarding school, to create a project that gives back to the world. The 17-year-old was nominated by her peers and teachers for the Kiril and Kate Sokoloff Grant for Compassion and Kindness. It included $2,500 to create any project she wanted, and she picked the garden at Nemours, inspired by her summer of interning there. The garden features a number of perennial plants and a butterfly bush.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s attorney general is investigating how e-cigarette giant Juul Labs’ blockbuster vaping device became so popular with underage teens. The company’s rapid rise to the top of the multibillion-dollar U.S. e-cigarette market has been accompanied by accusations from parents, politicians and public health advocates that Juul fueled a vaping craze among high schoolers. Five other state attorneys general are probing or suing Juul. Marrisa Geller, a spokeswoman for District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine, confirmed in a statement that an investigation of Juul is underway. She said Racine is concerned about “the dramatic increase in the use of vaping products by district youth” as well as the policies and practices employed by e-cigarette manufacturers to prevent minors from using their products.\n\nFlorida\n\nTitusville: Boeing has welcomed its newest astronaut to the Starliner team. Unlike other crew members, he doesn’t have advanced degrees in aerospace or much experience at all. In fact, he’s pretty dumb. Meet the Boeing Starliner’s anthropometric test device, also known as a crash-test dummy. A group of engineers and technicians have suited up the dummy, which will fly on the inaugural flight of the Starliner spacecraft now slated to launch late September or early October from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It took a team of five people to wrestle the rigid plastic dummy into the space suit. Melanie Weber, a Starliner design engineer, joked: “It’s like trying to get a bride in a wedding dress when’s she’s gained 10 pounds.” The procedure brings Boeing one step closer to launching humans to orbit, something that hasn’t happened from U.S. soil since the end of the shuttle program in 2011.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDuluth: A probation officer has resigned and her friend has been arrested for borrowing that officer’s badge and gun to get free snacks at a QuikTrip. WSB-TV reports 33-year-old Pektra LaQuiche Edgerton was arrested and charged with impersonating an officer. Gwinnett County Police Officer J.T. Smith says he saw Edgerton inside the QuikTrip with a badge and gun requesting free snacks, and her actions seemed suspicious. Smith’s body cam footage shows he pulled Edgerton over, and she was still wearing the badge. The footage shows Edgerton admitting that her passenger, Brandi Green, was an officer with the Department of Community Supervision, who let her borrow the gun and badge. The department says Green was suspended but later resigned.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Court officials have announced plans to converge operations in a newly built courthouse expected to open this week. West Hawaii Today reports the new Keahuolu Courthouse is expected to open Tuesday for its first day of official court operations on the Big Island. Officials say the $95.8 million courthouse will bring together all Family, Circuit and District courts cases that were operating out of three sites in north and south Kona. Officials say the three-story, 140,000-square-foot judiciary complex is expected to have five courtrooms, a law library, a traffic violations bureau, a grand jury room, a jury deliberations room and more. Judges say attorneys and their clients have been informed of the move and told their cases would be heard at the new location.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Universities in the state have been asking students to make up the difference as state funding has decreased over the past few decades, according to a report. A report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy has found that universities are getting about 47% of their funding from student tuition and fees, the Coeur d’Alene Press reports. Tuition and fees made up about 7% of universities’ funding in 1980, with state money making up the rest, according to the report released last month. The average cost for a year of college adjusted for inflation is about $7,800. The average cost was $1,300 in 1980.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Nature lovers will no longer have to fish between couch cushions for money to get into the Shedd Aquarium. The Chicago Sun-Times reports that admission to the aquarium will be free for Illinois residents on every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this month. Residents need to show a photo ID or other proof of residency to gain admission. Although admission will be free, the aquarium says visitors should get tickets in advance because space is limited.\n\nIndiana\n\nShelbyville: Sports betting is underway in the state, with Gov. Eric Holcomb placing a bet at the Indiana Grand Racing & Casino in Shelbyville on Sunday. The governor placed a $10 bet for the Colts to win the Super Bowl, a $10 bet for the Pacers to win the NBA Championship and a $10 bet for the Indiana Fever to win Sunday’s game against the Minnesota Lynx. Sports betting also opened at Ameristar Casino in East Chicago and the Hollywood casino in Lawrenceburg. Most of Indiana’s 13 state-regulated casinos and all three off-track betting parlors plan on offering sports betting by the month’s end. They expect to attract gamblers from neighboring states where sports wagers aren’t allowed. The Indiana Gaming Commission has approved the Horseshoe Hammond casino to start taking wagers Wednesday. The French Lick Resort has approval for opening its sportsbook Friday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials are moving ahead with a proposed $24million recycling center in Polk County that they say will ensure paper sorted for recycling is no longer dumped in a landfill. Environmentally aware Des Moines residents were frustrated after learning that nearly 20 tons of recycled paper ended up in the landfill every day last summer after the metro’s recycling company couldn’t find a buyer. Metro Waste Authority official Michael McCoy says the agency, which runs the landfill, wants to construct the facility to handle, sort and ultimately sell up to 45,000 tons of recyclables annually. The recycling center could open in 2021. McCoy noted the facility won’t increase Metro Waste ratepayers’ trash and recycling fees. But the president of a recycling processor believes otherwise.\n\nKansas\n\nOttawa: The oldest continuously operating movie theater in the world might figure to be in New York or Hollywood, but Kansas takes the title. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Ottawa is home to the Plaza 1907 Cinema, showing films since May 22, 1907, when black-and-white silent movies ruled the day. Ottawa is about 50 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, and is home to 12,300 people. What sets the theater apart is that over the past 112 years, it has never shut down and has remained at the same location. The Plaza applied for inclusion in the Guinness Book of World Records in 2017. It achieved the distinction of being the “World’s Oldest Operating Purpose-Built Cinema” after it was determined it was two days older than a theater in Denmark.\n\nKentucky\n\nInez: A school superintendent has apologized after some high school students were told to change out of gay pride T-shirts they wore to class. Martin County Superintendent Larry James told the Lexington Herald-Leader that students should have been allowed to wear the shirts. He blamed a miscommunication and said the situation has been resolved and won’t happen again. James said students can wear anything they want as long as it’s not “vulgar or obscene.” WYMT-TV reported that students were wearing shirts with the messages “lady lesbian” and “queer queen” when they were asked to change due to a dress code violation. James said it wasn’t the intent of school administrators to discriminate against anyone.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s oldest children’s museum has a shiny new home with spaces for kids of all ages, from those just learning to crawl to those who want to see a cicada’s delicate wings up close. The Louisiana Children’s Museum’s new $47.5 million building and grounds opened Saturday in City Park. Its 81/ 2 -acre campus includes lots of outside space to run around in, a toddler play area with a small picnic table, and a small lagoon with a floating classroom that children can crank along its track. The areas inside include one designed for play with babies and toddlers and four hands-on galleries for older kids. Those include a field-to-table exhibit about food and a 100-foot-long model of the Mississippi River, complete with running water.\n\nMaine\n\nWindham: Archaeologists are racing the clock to dig up the remains of a fort from the 1700s. The Maine Historical Preservation Commission says Province Fort was built during the Colonial era to protect settlers from Native Americans who opposed their encroachment in what’s now Windham. The remains were covered by a road, and archaeologists have a narrow window to check out the site during a road widening and repaving project. Archaeologists have found bases of chimneys, walls, bottles and pottery. Archaeologist John Mosher said he and others were worried that there was nothing left at the site. But he said what they’ve found has been “absolutely amazing.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The home where renowned journalist H.L. Mencken lived for decades before his death is getting a $1.5 million facelift. The Sun reports that contractors expect to complete renovation work on the office portion of the residence this fall. After that, restoration work is due to begin on the Hollins Street home’s public rooms. A retired Navy commander who lived in Hawaii and died in 2005 donated the money for the renovation work. Mencken’s father bought the home in 1883, three years after his son’s birth. After Mencken died there in 1956, his brother gave the property to the University of Maryland before the city took it over. A year ago, the nonprofit Baltimore National Heritage Area signed a lease with the city to assume stewardship of the home.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCape Cod: Local businesses are dealing with a challenging summer that’s included heightened shark fears, freak tornadoes and new taxes. Chamber of Commerce data suggests lodging and beach visit numbers are down, one year after the famous tourist destination dealt with two shark attacks, including Massachusetts’ first fatal one in more than 80 years. Colette Cummings, owner of Ducks in the Window toy shop, says tourist activity has been noticeably lighter but hasn’t yet hurt her bottom line. And Gail Knell, co-owner of The Ebb Tide, says she’s looking forward to the fall season to recoup thousands of dollars her restaurant she lost during the tornadoes. Wendy Northcross, the chamber’s CEO, says she expects August tourism numbers to rebound. Local officials are also urging beachgoers to remain vigilant, as last year’s fatal attack happened weeks after Labor Day.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: About 39% of communities in the state that approved a recreational marijuana ballot measure last year have since introduced local bans that prohibit businesses selling pot. Michigan’s Marijuana Regulatory Agency issued emergency rules in July giving local authorities six months to introduce bans before it starts to accept applications for business licenses Nov. 1. MLive.com reports that 308 of the 792 cities and townships that passed Proposal 1 in November have prohibited recreational marijuana businesses. Bruce Barcott, deputy editor of the marijuana news website Leafly, describes the local bans as the “second phase of legalization” and warns that banning legal sales will only encourage the black market to thrive.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Preliminary numbers show the freshman class at the University of Minnesota could be the largest in decades. Vice Provost and Dean Robert McMaster says the 6,200-student freshman class this year eclipses 2017’s as the largest in 50 years. Although the official enrollment number won’t be published until this fall, McMaster tells KARE-TV the university extended more offers to prospective students in 2019 after experiencing a slight decrease in applications. The number of applications fell from 44,000 last year to roughly 40,000 this year. He says the offers resulted in the large incoming class. Out-of-state and international student numbers appear to have increased in 2019. Last year, those figures dropped to their lowest percentage levels in about a decade.\n\nMississippi\n\nTupelo: Part of the museum marking Elvis Presley’s birthplace could get a little easier to access. City of Tupelo Chief Operating Officer Don Lewis tells the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal that the city is likely to buy some land from the Elvis Presley Birthplace Foundation. The foundation runs the museum, but the city owns the land. The foundation bought the land for about $8,500 so it could expand a road and add parking at a hilltop on the property where two Elvis statues stand. Elvis Presley Birthplace Director Dick Guyton says Elvis spent time atop the hill as a boy, dreaming about his future. Now, people must walk up the hill, but Guyton says that’s physically difficult for some visitors. Work on the road and parking spaces could start in October.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state attorney general’s office says Gov. Mike Parson should stop using the First Amendment to justify withholding some public information. Parson’s office has cited the First Amendment when refusing to release information such as phone numbers, addresses and emails of private citizens who contacted the governor’s office. The Kansas City Star reports Deputy Attorney General Justin Smith wrote in a letter to Parson on Thursday that courts have allowed redactions in specific cases but “not as a blanket approach.” State Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democratic candidate for governor, asked Attorney General Eric Schmitt in May for an opinion on whether Parson’s approach violated the open records law. Parson’s spokeswoman, Kelli Jones, said in a statement the governor’s actions were intended to protect people from harassment.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A wildlife organization says it has expanded its conservation area after purchasing a ranch. The Billings Gazette reports the American Prairie Reserve has added 22 square miles of land from Blue Ridge ranch in northeastern Montana. Wildlife officials say the organization owns 655 square miles of land with hopes to acquire enough private land to connect to about 4,700 square miles of existing public lands. Officials say the goal is to create a short-grass prairie ecosystem with its original inhabitants, including bison. Officials say ranchland adds elk, bighorn sheep, mule deer, pronghorn and prairie dogs to the conservation area. Some land owners say the organization is hurting family-owned and operated ranches and farms.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State health officials are reporting an outbreak of the mumps. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services says at least 30 cases of the highly contagious illness have been identified – 21/ 2 times the number of cases reported in the state for all of 2018. Most of this year’s cases occurred among people attending a wedding in northeastern Nebraska and in a workplace in southeastern Nebraska. Mumps is a virus that causes swollen glands, puffy cheeks, fever, headaches and, in severe cases, hearing loss and meningitis. It can spread quickly through coughing and sneezing. The health agency recommends people get vaccinated to avoid contracting the virus. People also are urged to avoid sharing drinking glasses and eating utensils, among other things.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A 33-year-old man died Thursday at Burning Man in the Black Rock Desert north of Reno. Shane Billingham, from New Zealand, was pronounced dead at an on-site medical facility at Burning Man, according to a release Friday from the Washoe County Regional Medical Examiner. Billingham showed a concentration of carbon monoxide in his blood “that would be poisonous to human life,” with the presence of controlled substances an exacerbating factor, according to toxicology results shared by the Pershing Sheriff’s Office. A spokesperson for the Burning Man organization said Billingham was discovered unresponsive in his vehicle at his camp, Beats Boutique, about 6:30 p.m. Thursday. Bystanders immediately began CPR, and emergency responders arrived shortly after.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlymouth: Homeless veterans are getting more help in northern New Hampshire. Harbor Homes, a nonprofit agency, led the development of the Boulder Point Veterans Housing project, which includes a 29,000-square-foot building in Plymouth with 25 one-bedroom apartments and five two-bedroom units. In addition to stable housing, residents will receive support services, health care and case management. The project got its start nearly seven years ago when a small group of residents raised concerns about the lack of resources for homeless veterans in the area. Public and private funding helped bring the project to fruition. A ribbon-cutting ceremony is planned for Friday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMontclair: A son of reggae legend Bob Marley and a Colorado firm have applied to open a medical marijuana dispensary in the city. Rohan Marley and Colorado-based dispensary Lightshade are seeking to open a store in Montclair. State officials recently announced that five cultivation, four vertically integrated and 15 retail dispensary licenses would be granted. Rohan Marley, who raised his five children in South Orange, said in a statement that his family in Jamaica has long advocated the medicinal benefits of marijuana. He would help with the dispensary’s marketing and hiring. Bob Marley, who died in 1981, was an adherent of the Rastafarian faith that regards cannabis as spiritually important. The New Jersey Department of Health says there is no immediate timetable for when licenses will be granted.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Supreme Court is abolishing a legal privilege that bars use of testimony by a defendant’s spouse. The court’s ruling says the spousal communication privilege “has outlived its useful life” and is based in misogyny. The ruling Friday bars future use of the privilege in the state court system. The court took the action in a ruling that upholds David Gutierrez’s murder conviction in a 2002 killing in Clovis. He had made incriminating statements both to a wife he later divorced and to his second wife. Gutierrez’s defense unsuccessfully objected to a trial judge’s decisions to allow both women to testify about the incriminating statements.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Canada goose hunting season is open throughout most of the state. Environmental Conservation Commissioner Basil Seggos says the September goose hunting season is designed to help reduce the resident Canada goose population, which has expanded to nuisance levels in some areas. New York’s population of non-migrating Canada geese has grown from 80,000 in 1995 to more than 340,000 today. Hunting seasons have been liberalized in efforts to curb population growth. The September Canada goose season runs from Sept. 1 through Sept. 25 in upstate goose hunting zones. Hunters are allowed to take eight to 15 birds a day depending on the zone.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNags Head: Old Bonner Bridge is coming down. About a half-mile of the center of the well-worn structure is gone, hauled offshore in massive pieces for its new purpose – an artificial reef, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Over nearly six decades, it endured thousands of vehicles traveling daily over its surface, barges and boats colliding into its pilings, harsh Outer Banks elements rusting the joints, and swirling currents nearly taking out its footing. The new $252 million, 2.8-mile Basnight Bridge over Oregon Inlet opened in February and is supposed to last 100 years. It is made with stronger concrete and steel, able to better resist the elements and boat collisions. Seven of its center spans measure 300 feet wide, much more accommodating for vessels to pass under and stay in the channel. The new bridge won several construction and engineering awards.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new federal grant of $6.5 million will help replace 18 aging rural bridges in the state. The grant comes from the federal transportation department’s Bridge Rural Repair Program. North Dakota transportation spokeswoman Jamie Olson tells the Bismarck Tribune it’s the first time this grant has been offered. Most of the bridges that will be replaced are in western North Dakota, including three each in Williams and Stark counties, two each in Burleigh and Ward counties, and one in McKenzie County.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A zoo says two more western lowland gorillas will soon join its blended gorilla family. The Columbus Dispatch reports 41/ 2 -year-old Sulaiman and his mother, 17-year-old Shalia, will be arriving at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium this fall from the Milwaukee County Zoo. Columbus Zoo officials say Sulaiman, nicknamed Sully, is a half-sibling of nearly 2-year-old Zahra, who was transferred to the Columbus facility last year after her parents died from gastrointestinal infections likely caused by a water supply infected with E. coli bacteria. Sully and Zahra have the same father. Audra Meinelt, curator of the Columbus Zoo’s Congo Expedition, says Sully and his mother will integrate into 35-year-old silverback gorilla Mac’s troop, if all goes well. She says Mac has accepted the zoo’s other foster gorillas.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTahlequah: The Tribal Council of the Cherokee Nation has unanimously approved the newly elected chief’s selection to be the tribe’s first-ever delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. The Tahlequah-based tribe says its 17-member council approved Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr.’s pick of Kimberly Teehee during a special meeting Thursday. Hoskin announced last month that he intends to exercise for the first time the tribe’s right to a congressional delegate, as outlined in treaties with the federal government. A Cherokee Nation citizen and former adviser to President Barack Obama, Teehee currently oversees government relations for the tribe and its business arm. Legal experts say the path to secure a tribal delegate would likely require congressional approval and be similar to those of island territories like Puerto Rico.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two years after a fire consumed trails and forests in the scenic Columbia River Gorge, the popular Eagle Creek Trail is in the final phases of reopening to the public. Stan Hinatsu with the U.S. Forest Service tells The Oregonian that the 13-mile trail could open as early as this fall or as late as next summer, depending on weather and assessments from forest officials. Crews still need to install replacements for two bridges that were destroyed in the fire, and the materials could be airlifted to the trail in late September. Hinatsu says once that’s complete, officials will need to determine whether to open the trail right away or wait until weather improves next summer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nProsperity: Authorities say a coal mine worker was killed when a long wall of coal collapsed on top of him at a mine in western Pennsylvania. The wall fell about 6 p.m. Thursday in the Enlow Fork Mine in Prosperity, about 40 miles southwest of Pittsburgh. State police says 25-year-old Tanner Lee McFarland of Washington, Pennsylvania, was killed in the accident. But the cause and manner of death had not been determined. No other injuries were reported in the collapse, which remained under investigation. The facility in the Washington County community is owned by Consol Energy. The mine is used for “longwall” mining, a form of underground coal mining in which a long wall is mined in a single slice.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: Attendance at Pawtucket Red Sox games has dropped as the team prepares to depart Rhode Island for Massachusetts. The Boston Globe reports the PawSox are averaging just 5,126 fans a game. The team averaged more than 9,500 fans a game in 2005. It’s the third-lowest attendance in the International League. The PawSox will play one more season at McCoy Stadium. The team is moving to Worcester in 2021 after Rhode Island leaders failed to agree on a deal to build a new stadium. PawSox vice president Dan Rea says the team expected “some small dip” in attendance. He says chilly weather in the early part of the season might have been partially responsible. Rea says the team is committed to not cutting operations during its last year at McCoy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Legislators are considering changing state laws that would allow short-sentenced criminals to serve in county jails due to prison staffing shortages. The Post and Courier reports an audit council released a report last week on the Department of Corrections that says the state has to either hire more staff or house fewer inmates to improve prison operations. It says increasing sentence requirements for state imprisonment could decrease inmate numbers. Inmates sentenced to more than three months must be sent to a state prison, which is the lowest minimum state sentence in the nation. About a third of the 2,350 state prison officer positions were vacant as of Aug. 1. The council says counties need to be compensated for the influx of inmates, but a figure hasn’t been proposed yet.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMadison: Dakota State University is another step closer to building a new athletics complex. The university has a $10 million gift from First Premier Bank/Premier Bankcard and Miles and Lisa Beacom – the largest single donation ever given to the school’s athletic program. Athletics director Jeff Dittman says the university’s facilities are outdated and inadequate for a competitive collegiate program. Plans for a new athletic complex feature a two-story concourse and outdoor facilities. Dittman says the new complex will allow DSU to host more events and camps and improve its ability to compete at the conference level. Premier Bankcard CEO Miles Beacom graduated from DSU in 1981 and is in the university’s athletics hall of fame.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is recognizing the contributions of its first African American naturalist. Park Superintendent Cassius Cash on Thursday presented Joe Lee with a mounted ranger hat in honor of his contribution to the history of the National Park Service. Cash said in a park news release that Lee’s service fifty years ago “broke employment barriers that once discouraged people of color from seeking employment in National Parks.” Cash, who is African American, said Lee’s service paved a path for him and others. Lee said he was “overwhelmed” by the recognition he received after reaching out to park staff to share his recollections. The park recently began a project to research the African American experience in southern Appalachia and share those stories.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Holocaust museum in the city is getting ready to open its doors on a new building that will also include information about other genocides, as well as human rights struggles in the U.S. The newly renamed Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museum is the latest in the U.S. to broaden its permanent exhibit and embolden its efforts to inspire visitors to make the world a better place. It opens Sept. 18. Expanding the focus to include more recent atrocities and human rights struggles helps draw in more visitors to be reminded that the lessons from the Holocaust are still relevant. Museum president and CEO Mary Pat Higgins says the hope is that after visitors leave, they’ll contemplate what they can do to make a difference in their community.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Immigration activists have protested the pending deportation of a Mexican woman who has provided health and nutrition education for an immigrant aid group. The Salt Lake Tribune reported Friday that 55-year-old Cecelia Figueroa was detained when she went for what she thought was a routine check-in interview with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Figueroa says she was told by ICE officials that she would be deported Monday. Figueroa says she is from a violent part of Mexico that thinks returning immigrants coming from the U.S. are wealthy, making her and her family targets. Protesters say they want officials to consider giving her asylum. ICE says that people violating immigration laws are subject to arrest, detention and deportation and that they do not target based on advocacy positions.\n\nVermont\n\nBradford: An anonymous flyer denying that Bigfoot is behind the prolonged closure of a bridge has locals talking about the mythical forest creatures. The flyer first spotted at the Bradford post office said the prolonged closure of the Creamery Bridge over the Waits River was not due to the “displacement of or intrusion on a ‘Sasquatch’ or Bigfoot, either a single creature or several.” Last week Dartmouth College Professor Alexander Chee posted a photo of the flyer to Twitter. Since then, copies have been popping up across town. Local resident Claudia Johnson tells MyNBC5 she thinks there’s a local Bigfoot because she’s heard unexplained rustling behind her home. State transportation officials say the bridge is scheduled to be fixed in October.\n\nVirginia\n\nLovingston: A distillery is toasting the end of a lawsuit alleging that it improperly tried to pass off American whiskey as Scotch. The Scotch Whisky Association alleged in federal court in Delaware that Virginia Distillery Co. engaged in false and deceptive labeling of whiskey sold under the brand name “Virginia-Highland Whisky.” The lawsuit claimed that the use of the term “Highland” and its spelling of “Whisky” without an “e” falsely implied that the product was produced in Scotland. The case was terminated last month. As part of the settlement, Virginia Distillery will stop using the word “Highland” after it sells remaining stock. The distillery will continue to label all products using “whisky” without the “e,” which it says is allowed under U.S. law.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A federal judge has ruled that a disputed area in the state’s south is part of the Yakama Nation Indian Reservation. The Yakima-Herald Republic reports the ruling Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Rice allows the tribe to have jurisdiction over Native American residents in the nearly 190-square-mile rural area southwest of Goldendale. The land became disputed more than a century ago after the original map of the reservation was lost. Rice says in the ruling that the land disputes “prompted a number of erroneous federal surveys that further complicated the historical record.” Klickitat County officials argued that the tribe’s treaty with the U.S. government never intended to include the area and that the matter was settled when the government adopted a reservation boundary without it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The chief of the Huntington Fire Department has been named as the American Legion’s national firefighter of the year. Chief Jan K. Rader received the award at the American Legion’s 101st National Convention in Indianapolis last week. Rader is the state’s first female fire chief after having been a firefighter for nearly 25 years. The American Legion says it gives the annual award to a firefighter who exceeds the requirements of their position and shows a pattern of community service. The group noted Rader’s work on opioid addiction in Huntington as reason why she won. Rader says she’s humbled by the award.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The growing number of people living in tents in a homeless encampment under an overpass downtown has local officials concerned. Advocates for the homeless say there are about 50 to 60 people living in the camp under Interstate 794, which has been growing since April. Milwaukee County Housing Division outreach services manager Eric Collins-Dyke tells WTMJ-TV the goal is to get everyone off the street before the cold weather arrives. Collins-Dyke says in the past few weeks the county has been able to move 15 people into permanent housing. He says the camp continues to grow despite the best efforts of outreach workers trying to move people into housing.\n\nWyoming\n\nMammoth Hot Springs: A famous hotel in Yellowstone National Park is open again after renovations. The National Park Service reopened the Mammoth Hot Springs hotel Friday after a four-year project that cost $30 million. About 100 people attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Park maintenance worker Dean Heppner helped with the effort to fix up the 106-year-old hotel in northern Yellowstone. Heppner tells the Billings Gazette it was a chance to see features of the building nobody else could see. The hotel gets about 95,000 visitors a year.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/09/smokey-bear-tarantula-trek-censoring-adam-eve-news-around-states/39932141/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Some residents of a rural community are complaining about a Spanish-language event planned for this weekend featuring live music and bull riding, but a local official says he worries such comments appear “anti-Latino.” News outlets report people from the Snowdoun area near Montgomery have asked county and city leaders to block the Festival Latino, scheduled Sunday in a field. They say a similar event in July was so loud and raucous it traumatized livestock. But Montgomery Mayor Todd Strange says organizers haven’t violated any zoning rules. County Commissioner Dan Harris says he voted against a move to block the festival because opposition appears to be “anti-Latino” even if it isn’t. Harris says he doesn’t want to be part of that, particularly after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A wildlife monitoring group is seeking citizen scientists to help track beluga whales off the state’s coast. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Alaska Beluga Monitoring Partnership is offering volunteers an opportunity to help scientists understand more about Cook Inlet beluga whales. The partnership is a collaboration of several organizations including Beluga Whale Alliance, Defenders of Wildlife and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Monitoring events are expected to take place between Aug. 14 and Nov. 15. Planned monitoring locations include Twentymile River and Bird Point near Girdwood, Ship Creek in Anchorage, and the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers. Officials say volunteers will learn about the conservation needs of Cook Inlet beluga whales and receive training on identifying and recording data on beluga distribution and behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials have approved placing a “sanctuary city” measure on the ballot, but not without some pushback. KVOA-TV reports the Tucson City Council voted Tuesday night to allow the initiative on the November ballot, which could potentially lead to Arizona’s first-ever “sanctuary city.” Councilmembers were required to vote after the measure got more than the minimum required number of petition signatures. The initiative would add protections for people living in the U.S. illegally. Video shows a woman wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat repeatedly shouting that the initiative defies U.S. immigration law. The footage has since gone viral on social media because of an man in a green polo shirt laughing nearby. #GreenShirtGuy was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is asking lawmakers to approve $25 million for a new state grant program aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the creation of the Arkansas Rural Connect program, which will provide grants to qualifying communities with at least 500 people to deploy high-speed broadband to residents. Hutchinson, who announced the program at a meeting of the Arkansas Sheriffs’ Association in Rogers, says he’ll ask the Legislative Council to approve $5.7 million for the program this year, and the remainder will need to be appropriated by lawmakers in next year’s legislative session. In May, Hutchinson released a plan to expand rural access to high-speed broadband by 2022.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Actor Danny Trejo played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after two cars collided at an intersection in the Sylmar neighborhood Wednesday. Video aired by KABC-TV shows Trejo at the crash scene. Trejo says he crawled into the wrecked vehicle from one side but couldn’t unbuckle the child’s car seat from that angle. He says another bystander, a young woman, was able to undo the buckle. Together they pulled the baby safely from the wreckage. The Los Angeles Fire Department says three people were taken to a hospital, and there were no life-threatening injuries. The 75-year-old Trejo, an L.A. native, is perhaps best known for playing the character Machete, originally from the “Spy Kids” series.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: State wildlife officials say thousands of tarantulas are expected to start their annual migration through the state soon. The Gazette reports the migration is expected to begin this month through early October. Officials say the Oklahoma brown tarantulas migrate through La Junta, about 176 miles southeast of Denver. Scientists say the majority of the spiders are 10-year-old males looking to mate with females hidden in Colorado’s grasslands. Officials say the peak time to view the migration is mid-September near Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta off U.S. Highway 109. Officials say tarantulas are mostly harmless to humans but have bites that can cause injury or allergic reaction and hairs that can be irritating to the eyes, mouth and nose.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The federal Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into the state’s policy allowing transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. The investigation follows a complaint by the families of three girls who say they were discriminated against by having to compete in track against two athletes who were identified as male at birth. They say that violates Title IX, the federal law designed to ensure equal athletic opportunities for females. The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by their gender identification. Transathlete.com says Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Everyone’s a critic, including Delaware Air National Guard officials who wanted nude images of Adam and Eve depicted in a 50-year-old mural by famed artist Jamie Wyeth to put on some pants. Someone apparently isn’t mooning over the huge, 10-by-30-foot mural that shows the bare buttocks of the Garden of Eden couple. It hangs on a wall of a building at the guard’s 80-acre base at the New Castle County Airport. The mural was created by Wyeth when he served with the Delaware Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Air National Guard officials have had recent talks about possibly altering or covering up part of the artwork by the well-known painter. Wyeth is the scion of three generations of widely celebrated American artists, including his illustrator grandfather N.C. Wyeth and his late father Andrew Wyeth, one of the best-known painters of the 20th century.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An internal review of D.C. public schools shows more than 30% of employees have expired background checks. News outlets report Chancellor Lewis Ferebee shared the review’s findings with parents Tuesday and in a letter Wednesday. The district launched the review in June after an employee of a private before- and after-school program allegedly kissed and fondled a 13-year-old student on multiple occasions. The district says it discovered the company didn’t conduct proper background checks. Ferebee says by the end of October, all after-school staff, school staff and central office staff will have active background checks. He also says staff will receive more training on how to spot and respond to sexual misconduct cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state is expanding its efforts to eradicate invasive pythons in the Everglades and is working with the federal government to get snake hunters to remote areas of Big Cypress National Preserve. DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida will double its resources for python removal and that the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Agriculture have a new agreement to begin hunting pythons in 130,000 acres of state parks. He’s directing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the South Florida Water Management District to work together to research ways to eliminate pythons and to make a python challenge an annual event instead of once every three years. The challenge awards python hunters who capture the most snakes, which have decimated native species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMilton: A farmer says his beloved miniature donkey named Sammy was literally scared to death by this year’s Fourth of July fireworks. Now he and an animal rights group want Georgia to ban rockets that go boom. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker David Ralston and others Wednesday asking for a “Sammy’s law” limiting fireworks to the non-explosive, non-aerial varieties. John Bogino tells WGCL-TV that Sammy and his other farm animals are like pets to him. His pet donkey of 22 years died last month, and he says Sammy wasn’t his first animal to die because of fireworks. He says one of his horses fled explosions in late July several years ago and had to be euthanized due to severe injuries.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists have discovered that a growing pond of water inside a crater is being heated by the Kilauea volcano. The U.S. Geological Survey says temperature readings taken last weekend show that the pool of water in Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, the former home of a popular lava lake, is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit. For the first time in recorded history, the presence of water in the crater was confirmed last week. Since then, scientists have found two other small pools of water nearby. The crater floor collapsed about 2,000 feet, and the lava lake disappeared last summer as Kilauea stopped erupting for the first time in over 30 years. USGS geologist Matt Patrick told the Associated Press it’s hard to determine how deep the magma chamber is beneath the bottom of the crater floor where the water was found.\n\nIdaho\n\nSpokane: A study by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has found that cougars kill more elk than wolves in the state. The Spokesman-Review reports the study found that wolves accounted for 32% of adult female elk deaths and 28% of elk calf deaths. The study found that cougars accounted for 35% of adult female elk deaths and 45% of elk calf deaths. The study published earlier this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management examined 15 years of data. The study also found that food availability and the severity of winter is the most important factor for elk calf survival. Idaho Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife research biologist Jon Horne says the findings are also likely applicable for Washington, Montana and Canada.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Officials are showcasing one of the most popular attractions of the Illinois State Fair. The butter cow was unveiled Wednesday afternoon at the fairgrounds. The sculpture has been a part of the state fair for almost 100 years. This year’s cow has been sculpted from 800 pounds of recycled butter. The cow stands near the word “Future” to incorporate the theme of the fair, which is “Building Our Future.” The cow is on display at the Dairy Building. Last year, hundreds of pounds of butter were sculpted into a cow by the same Iowa artist, Sarah Pratt. The base had “Land of Lincoln” written on it and included a stovepipe hat, as a nod to Abraham Lincoln. The fair started Thursday and ends Aug. 18.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Rainbow-colored streamers welcomed students back for the first day of classes Thursday at Cathedral High School, a show of support for a gay teacher fired from the Catholic school over the summer. The brightly colored streamers were a silent twist on a long-held Cathedral tradition to decorate “the hill” with toilet paper on the first day of school, but they still spoke volumes. The private high school has been embroiled in a debate over LGBTQ rights since it fired longtime teacher Joshua Payne-Elliott because of his same-sex marriage. Cathedral officials have said they only did so at the order of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which began requiring employment contracts with “ministerial language” and morality clauses to be used at its schools four years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: They’ve built it. Now they’re coming. Major League Baseball is headed to town in 2020. The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees announced Thursday that the two teams will play an official big-league game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site Aug. 13, 2020. “It’s definitely exciting,” says Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go the Distance Baseball, which owns the Field of Dreams movie site. “There’s nothing more American than the Field of Dreams and America’s pastime.” The 1989 movie centers on the 1919 White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson. Jackson, who was banned by MLB along with seven of his teammates for his alleged role in the White Sox throwing the 1919 World Series, inspires a farmer, played by Kevin Costner, to build a baseball field. The site has since become a tourist attraction, with fans from across the globe flocking to the Iowa cornfield to see it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to impose what some tax experts say would be the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting taxes on online sales, possibly inviting a legal battle. The Department of Revenue issued a notice last week saying any “remote seller” doing business with Kansas residents must register with the department, collect state and local sales taxes, and forward the revenues to the state, starting Oct. 1. It cites a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year allowing states to collect sales taxes on internet sales. Most states now have policies to collect such taxes, but almost all set minimum annual sales or transaction thresholds to exempt small businesses, according to groups tracking tax laws. Kansas is the first to attempt to collect the taxes without exempting any businesses, they said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Amid major legislative efforts to restrict or end abortion in the state, a new poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood finds a majority of likely voters in the commonwealth believe the procedure should remain available. Asked whether it’s important for women to have “access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion,” 65% said yes, according to the poll. Also, 65% said they’d have doubts about a law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion. Just 18% said they believe all abortions should be illegal – though another 37% said abortion should be allowed only in “extreme cases,” such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. And 43% said abortion should be legal with some regulations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPride: A highway marker honoring blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy has been recovered, months after it disappeared. News outlets report Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office received a tip Wednesday that the sign was at a person’s house in Pride, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. Lt. Craig Dabadie says investigators believe a driver ran off the road and knocked the sign off a pole in May. Someone else picked it up as a souvenir. The sign was posted along Louisiana 1, marking the spot where Guy recorded a music video. The marker honors the Louisiana native’s legacy in music. Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 23 on its list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists.” No arrests were made, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal program designed to help farmers suffering due to trade disruption is unlikely to assist the state’s wild blueberry growers. Maine is the sole commercial producer of wild blueberries in the United States. The industry has struggled in recent years with falling crop sizes and low prices to farmers. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal has called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include the crop in its Market Facilitation Program, which is slated to provide billions to growers negatively impacted by foreign trade retaliation. But the USDA said in a statement that the program is intended for crops that aren’t easily used in school food programs or through food banks. Wild blueberries sometimes fill those needs. The agency says the blueberries remain eligible for other USDA assistance programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The news of Toni Morrison’s death led a west Baltimore artist to create his own version of an ancestral shrine. The Baltimore Sun reports that 50-year-old Ernest Shaw Jr. completed a mural of the celebrated artist and Nobel laureate by Tuesday, just a day after Morrison’s death. Shaw says he considers the death of the 88-year-old Morrison to be the acquiring of an ancestor. He says creating the mural was his way of pouring libations, a reference to a ritual used to honor ancestors and deities. He says there’s no death in dying as Morrison has just transitioned to now work with “the other side.” The spontaneous mural dedicated to “TONI M” covers a Graffiti Alley wall behind Motor House and took several hours to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Ever since “Boston Strong” became a rallying cry after the Boston Marathon bombing, the idea of “strong” has become an inescapable part of how this country heals after tragedy. People mourning this past weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas have rallied around the slogans “Dayton Strong” and “El Paso Strong.” After many tragedies, the mantra has been used in social media posts, memorials, pins, stickers and other mementos. Massachusetts resident Christopher Dobens co-created the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” T-shirts that helped rocket the phrase into the national lexicon. He says the idea was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong cancer foundation and the U.S. Army’s “Army Strong” slogan. Dobens says it’s heartbreaking to see so many places have had to adopt the “strong” mantra because of violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: State and federal agencies are gearing up for a celebration of Smokey Bear’s 75-year legacy of preventing forest fires. Smokey will join staffers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other partners Friday at Straits State Park in St. Ignace. A family-friendly birthday party is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. It will feature a fire truck open house, displays of wildland fire equipment, fire-prevention games, refreshments and an opportunity to meet the iconic bear. Smokey has shared fire-prevention messages with the signature phrase, “Only you can prevent wildfires.” Debbie Begalle of the Michigan DNR’s Forest Resources Division says the slogan is still relevant. Nine out of 10 wildfires are started by people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Natural Resources has denied requests to reconsider the tailings dam permits that it issued for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The DNR said Wednesday that opponents did not raise any new issues that materially affect its 2018 decision granting the permits. The Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa and environmental groups asked the DNR to reconsider in light of tailings dam failures elsewhere. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a statement that her agency studied the failures but remains confident in the safety of the PolyMet dam. The DNR issued its decision one day after the Minnesota Court of Appeals stayed a different permit for the mine, governing water pollution, pending a court investigation into potential irregularities in how state and federal regulators handled that permit.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Hurricane Katrina left lasting scars on the Hurricane Camille Memorial at the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. The church reached out to the Biloxi Fire Department, which, in turn, reached out to Lodging and Leisure Investments for help in returning the memorial to its best condition in light of the storm’s upcoming 50th anniversary. Officials tell WLOX-TV restoring the tile mosaic is the greatest challenge in the project. Other work includes power washing and cleaning each name on the memorial’s walls. Camille’s 50th anniversary will include a memorial service at the memorial site at 5 p.m. Aug. 17. Afterward, a program will be held at the Seafood & Maritime Industry Museum at 6 p.m.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Attorney General Eric Schmitt says counting of untested rape kits in the state is nearly complete. Schmitt said Wednesday that 95.6% of law enforcement agencies and 98.5% of hospitals and Veterans Affairs medical facilities have completed their inventory of sexual assault evidence kits. Former Attorney General Josh Hawley began an audit of the backlog in 2017 after the Columbia Missourian reported Missouri had never done a statewide review of untested rape kits. Schmitt began a SAFE Kits Initiative in February and appointed Judge M. Keithley Williams to lead the effort to eliminate the backlog of sexual assault kits. The counting project received funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Rape kits contain DNA samples and other evidence from medical procedures conducted immediately after an attack.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do, his attorney says. Attorney Lance Jasper told the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who became caught up in the heightened animosity and rhetoric gripping the nation and convinced himself he was following the president’s orders. “His commander in chief is telling people that if they kneel, they should be fired, or if they burn a flag, they should be punished,” Jasper said. He said Brockway “certainly didn’t understand it was a crime.” Brockway suffered a traumatic brain injury in a vehicle crash in 2000 that has affected his decision making, and Jasper said he plans to raise that in his client’s defense.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The remains of twins who joined the Navy together have been returned to the city for burial, decades after their deaths on a battleship at Pearl Harbor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports two ceremonies will be held in succession Saturday at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery for Rudolph Blitz and brother Leo Blitz. There will be two flag-covered caskets, two 21-gun salutes, two invocations, two flags presented to their surviving sister, 93-year-old Lincoln resident Betty Pitsch. Her DNA contribution helped bring her older brothers home. The 17-year-old twins left Lincoln High to join the Navy in 1938 and had been stationed at Pearl Harbor for a year and a day before the USS Oklahoma went down during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. Their remains were buried at a Honolulu cemetery and later identified after being unearthed in 2015.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A jumbo jetliner that sparked controversy at last year’s Burning Man festival when it got stuck in the desert for nearly a month has returned for this year’s event after organizers agreed to post a bond for the popular art installation. The Bureau of Land Management granted a special permit to the foundation that converted the 747 into a nightclub. Burning Man officials reviewed the Big Imagination Foundation’s plans before it transported the multi-ton aircraft last weekend to the Black Rock Desert, 100 miles north of Reno. Group leaders haven’t disclosed the cost of the performance bond. They get the money back if they comply with the permit. Critics say the plane severely damaged the playa floor last year when it dug holes into the soft alkali dust and got stuck.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a bill to help the state’s dairy farmers. The purpose of the bill is to provide a way to support dairy farmers by buying specially labeled milk for an extra 50 cents per gallon. The measure creates a dairy premium fund that replaces the milk producers’ emergency relief fund. Money remaining in the fund after payment of the premiums would be available to promote the program. It’s anticipated that the premium milk will be available this fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: Two actors from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” visited federal immigration detainees at the Hudson County jail Thursday. Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver met with two female detainees from Jamaica. The actors, whose show tackled issues of immigration detention and family separation in its final season, said they wanted to draw attention to the plight of immigrants in such facilities. The visit was organized by Freedom for Immigrants, an organization that aims to abolish immigration detention and was featured in the final season of the show, and First Friends of New Jersey and New York, a nonprofit that sends volunteers to visit immigrant detainees. After leaving the jail, Tarver recounted the story of the woman she met, a victim of domestic violence who sought help from the police and wound up detained, for four months so far, when her immigration status came into play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSan Antonio: A federal agency is taking advantage of high water levels in the Rio Grande to help a tiny minnow listed as an endangered species. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation workers recently aided in creating more habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow on the Middle Rio Grande, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Reclamation crews worked from January to March to lower and widen the riverbank on the southern end of private property near Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They excavated 46,000 cubic yards of dirt to create water channels where minnows could escape the fast-moving river. The tiny fish, listed as endangered in 1994, was once abundant throughout the Rio Grande Basin from Colorado to Texas and into Mexico. It’s now found only in a fraction of its historic habitat as the river system has seen dam building and the straightening of its once meandering channels over the past 150 years.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has approved legislation aimed at bolstering the health and safety standards for all pet dealers operating in the state. The bill signed Thursday calls for separate spaces for pregnant animals and requires all enclosures be cleaned daily and disinfected at least once every two weeks. “Pet dealers must be held to standards that will promote the safety, good health, and overall well-being of the animals in their care,” says a memo attached to the bill. Under the new law, which takes effect in 90 days, pet dealers are required to regularly groom animals to prevent matting and flea and tick infestations and provide animals with diurnal lighting cycles, which mimic natural, 24-hour light patterns. And any for-profit dealer selling, or planning to sell, at least 25 cats or dogs in a year must provide an annual veterinary checkup for each animal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: The city is being recognized for its commitment to preserving monarch butterflies. Wake Forest announced Wednesday that the recognition was awarded by Monarch City USA, a nonprofit organization that promotes the species and recognizes areas that work on recovering butterfly populations. The nonprofit group says that the butterflies rely on milkweed and nectar plants. The butterfly’s population has declined as the plants have dwindled. Wake Forest, northeast of Raleigh, features the plants that attract the butterflies at E. Carroll Joyner Park. The town has installed signs that identify the butterfly habitat and one noting Wake Forest’s designation as a “Monarch City USA.” The nonprofit says it’s the first in the state to receive the designation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two environmental groups who say regulators should have intervened in the location of an oil refinery near the state’s top tourist attraction, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, are taking their case to the state Supreme Court. The Public Service Commission last year declined to review whether the refinery could be built just 3 miles from the park in the western Badlands, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators concluded the proposed $800 million Davis Refinery would be too small to warrant review under state law. The Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council don’t believe developer Meridian Energy Group is being forthright about the refinery’s size and asked a state judge to force the commission to hold a hearing. South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick refused in May, ruling that the PSC followed state law.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringdale: A long-standing community event is facing backlash on social media. A Facebook post promoting Springdale’s annual Goldfish Swim has garnered more than 3,500 comments, most outraged, since it was posted Aug. 1. The end-of-summer event has been going on for almost 40 years. More than 4,700 people have signed a Change.org petition to stop the event, saying it is “obvious” animal abuse. City officials take 1,000 feeder goldfish and put them in the Springdale Community Center Pool. Children under the age of 12 try to catch the fish with their bare hands, take them home and care for them. “No nets, poles or help from mom and dad. Bring a plastic bucket to take your new pet home,” the post about the event says. The event is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Springdale Pool.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Police were justified when they fatally shot a black teenager who was naked and unarmed, an attorney for the city argues in a response to a civil rights lawsuit filed by the teen’s parents. The parents of Isaiah Mark Lewis contend in their federal lawsuit that Sgt. Milo Box and Officer Denton Scherman used excessive force and acted “unnecessarily and unjustly” when they hit their 17-year-old son with a stun gun and then fatally shot him April 29 after he allegedly broke into a home. In a response filed Wednesday on behalf of the city, attorney Taylor Clark denies that the city violated Lewis’ constitutional rights and says: “Lewis was justifiably shot by a service weapon after being ineffectively tasered.” “Edmond also admits that Isaiah Mark Lewis was naked and unarmed when he was shot and that verbal commands were given to Isaiah Mark Lewis prior to the shooting,” Clark wrote. The officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Taylor declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge has ruled that the state Fish and Wildlife Commission illegally reversed an earlier decision granting endangered species status to the marbled murrelet, a small seabird that nests in old-growth forests. Environmental groups say Oregon has sought to avoid protections for the bird, allowing clear-cut logging in its habitat. A spokeswoman for the wildlife department said it won’t comment on legal matters. The ruling was by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Holland in Eugene. Conservation groups said they petitioned the wildlife commission to list the marbled murrelet as endangered, and it voted to do so, concluding the bird was likely to go extinct. But the commission reversed itself without explanation. Holland said the commission was required to explain its reversal and failed to do so.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia’s Music Alliance will induct musicians spanning a wide range of genres to its Walk of Fame, including The Philadelphia Orchestra, R&B group The O’Jays and ’80s rock band The Hooters. The class of 2019’s other honorees include Philadelphia socialite and philanthropist Dorrance “Dodo” Hamilton, who died in 2017; disco queen Evelyn “Champagne” King; and Jody Gerson, the current CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and the first woman to run a major music-publishing company. Longtime rock-radio DJ Pierre Robert is this year’s dual Radio Row Award recipient and Walk of Fame inductee. The announcements were made Wednesday at the Independence Visitor Center. The group will be formally inducted Oct. 22 during a gala at The Bellevue.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state will begin offering a gender-neutral option for residents to put on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates. Rhode Island will join the ranks of about a dozen other states already offering an option of “X” instead of the standard “M” or “F.” The option is in response to the governor’s conversations with the transgender and LGBTQ community. The Democratic governor says this is “just basic fairness” in order to ensure all residents are being recognized for who they are. The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health echoed the governor’s remarks. The governor adds that the biggest hurdle has been the implementation of the change. Residents could potentially see the option available within a year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAiken: Officials say the U.S. government followed a requirement to remove weapons-grade plutonium from the state. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 1 metric ton of nuclear material has been shipped out of the Savannah River Site near Aiken. The U.S. Energy Department was ordered in 2017 to remove that much plutonium by January. Federal court records said half the plutonium was sent to Nevada. Wilson’s statement Wednesday didn’t say where the other half was shipped. South Carolina sued the federal agency after it halted a plan to turn plutonium once used to make nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors. The Energy Department owes the state $200 million in fines in part because 11 metric tons of plutonium remain at the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: As this small town recovers from a tornado that destroyed its civic center and caused other extensive damage, some residents are asking why the community’s warning siren wasn’t sounded. The EF-1 tornado with 100 mph winds ripped through Burke on Tuesday night, ripping roofs off buildings and homes, uprooting trees and leaving the school building unusable for the beginning of classes. Two men suffered minor injuries when a garage collapsed. Gov. Kristi Noem visited the community Wednesday and called the damage “unbelievable.” Noem promised the state’s help in the community’s restoration efforts. Burke Mayor Thomas Glover says the siren is sounded when officials get notification of a tornado sighting or that one is imminent. Glover says that did not happen.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Add Glen Campbell to the list of late country music legends with a museum in their honor in the city’s downtown. Clearbrook Hospitality LLC announced plans Thursday to open The Glen Campbell Museum and Rhinestone Stage, a live music venue, at the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue. It’s slated to open in early 2020. Campbell died in 2017 at age 81 following an extended battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The 4,000-square-foot venue will feature immersive, interactive displays showcasing different stages of Campbell’s career. He was a studio musician in The Wrecking Crew; the singer of many hit records including “Rhinestone Cowboy” and “Southern Nights”; and a television and film actor. In the evenings, the museum will transform into live music venue The Rhinestone Stage, where national and local acts can perform intimate shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is coming this weekend. The Texas Comptroller’s Office says the tax break begins Friday and runs through Sunday. Customers can buy most clothing, footwear, school supplies and backpacks – sold for less than $100 – tax free from a Texas store or from an online or catalog seller doing business in the state. The sales tax exemption applies only to qualifying items. The tax break does not include products such as jewelry, handbags, briefcases, luggage, computer bags, umbrellas, wallets and watches. The Texas sales tax holiday weekend started in 1999.\n\nUtah\n\nRiverton: Administrators from more than 60 schools in northern Utah gathered ahead of the first day of classes to assemble “care kits” for students in need. The Deseret News reports administrators from the Jordan School District met Wednesday to pack more than 2,400 kits, which include food, personal hygiene products and backpacks loaded with school supplies. Walmart donated the supplies. Event organizer Peggy Margetts said the kits help students in a discrete way and show students their school cares about their well-being. Students will receive the kits at the start of school. Administrators said they will keep some on hand to use during the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets says the state’s cheese producers won 44 ribbons at the American Cheese Society’s annual awards competition. Officials say this is Vermont’s best showing yet. The results were announced at the society’s annual conference last week in Richmond, Virginia. Agriculture officials say five Vermont cheeses were finalists for the best in show. A total of 25 Vermont companies submitted cheeses to be judged among the more than 2,000 total entries. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott congratulated the state’s cheesemakers on their “impressive achievement.” He says their “commitment to excellence is helping Vermont grow its economy by creating jobs and further strengthening our great Vermont brand.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Town officials are cracking down on an unsanctioned Virginia Tech fraternity they say is operating in violation of zoning rules. Blacksburg officials recently determined the house is being used as a base for the rogue frat Omega Alpha Kappa. Zoning Administrator Paul Patterson said frat activities at the house must stop. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fraternity is not recognized by the university and was formed by members of Kappa Delta Rho when that chapter was suspended for violating alcohol policies. The fraternity has a history of trash citations and accusations that members made female guests at social events feel uncomfortable. The Roanoke Times reports the university has advised students to avoid the fraternity and seven others for their safety.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A $219 million property-tax levy that would abolish overdue fines in the Seattle Public Library system is heading toward approval. The Seattle Times reports the seven-year levy supporting the library system had 73% of the vote in returns Tuesday. The measure proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan would authorize additional property taxes and replace a $123 million library levy set to expire at the end of this year. The levy would collect about 12 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value in 2020. The additional library funding would support seismic renovations, new programs for children, more social workers, extended operating hours and the elimination of fines for overdue items. About $167 million would be used to maintain current services.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Public Port Authority board has decided to consider lease proposals and bids for the Heartland Intermodal Gateway Facility in Prichard. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board made a motion Wednesday in Charleston to delay a possible public sale. West Virginia Transportation Secretary Byrd White says the board discussed selling it because of a funding shortage. Wayne County Commissioner Jeff Maddox says the county’s economy isn’t the best, but a sale for “pennies on the dollar” would be “a grave error.” The board will further discuss options at its September meeting. The $32 million facility opened in 2015 on 76 acres donated by Norfolk Southern railroad. It’s designed to move containers more efficiently by rail through a double-stack method while offering a cheaper alternative to gas-guzzling trucks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State prison officials say they illegally released information that could reveal whether inmates are in substance abuse treatment. The Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials responding to an open records request released records June 24 that contained 1,041 inmates’ personal identification numbers and locations. No names were released, but DOC officials say someone could use the numbers and locations to learn whether an inmate is at a substance abuse facility or receiving treatment. The agency says that information is confidential under Wisconsin law. Only two people saw the information, and they’ve since confirmed the data has been destroyed. DOC spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn’t answer emailed questions asking who received the questions and what information they actually wanted.\n\nWyoming\n\nMeeteetse: A ranch where black-footed ferrets were discovered in the 1980s is being preserved. The Nature Conservancy recently announced a conservation easement agreement to restrict the Lazy BV ranch’s 2,300 acres near Meeteetse from being subdivided or developed. The ranch is in the area where the ferrets were discovered in 1981 after they were thought to be extinct. The ferrets were used to start a captive-breeding program that has restored black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and elsewhere in the western U.S. Jim Luchsinger of The Nature Conservancy tells Wyoming Public Radio it had been a dream of the ranch owners to protect the ranch and bring ferrets back. The protected land is also home to greater sage grouse, mule deer, antelope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/09"}]}
