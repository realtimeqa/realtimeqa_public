Wes Moore, along with members of the state's National Guard, and Maj. Gen. Janeen Birckhead awarded Tubman the rank of brigadier general during a Veterans Day ceremony, according to the governor's office. During the ceremony, the Maryland National Guard and Moore officially recognized Tubman for her military service to the U.S. and Maryland.\n\nThe commemoration, held at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park and Visitor Center, was attended by dozens of people including Tubman's descendants, military members, community members, and local leaders. Birckhead said the occasion was \"long overdue,\" noting that it was due to a state law passed earlier this year that authorizes the governor to make certain posthumous awards.\n\n\"Harriet Tubman should be revered always for risking her life and her own freedom and the cause of justice for the enslaved,\" Birckhead said at the ceremony. \"Now we make the grassroots honor, in a formal way, to proclaim that Harriet Tubman was courageous, she sacrificed, she's a skillful leader and she advanced the survival of a nation.\"\n\nMoore called Monday's ceremony not just a \"great day\" for Maryland but for the entire U.S.\n\nTubman, who was born into slavery in Dorchester County, Maryland, had escaped in 1849 to Philadelphia — where she lived as a free woman. But Tubman later returned to Maryland several times to rescue her family and other enslaved people through the Underground Railroad, a network of escape routes and safe houses organized by Black and white abolitionists.\n\n\"There is nobody who defined 'leave no one behind' in the way that Gen. Tubman left no one behind,\" Moore said during the ceremony. \"No one would have judged her if she helped to coordinate the entire abolitionist cause and the entire abolitionist movement from Philadelphia ... But she knew that in order to do the work, that meant that she had to go into the lion's den.\"\n\nThe commissioning proclamation was received by Tubman's great-great-great-grandniece, Ernestine \"Tina\" Martin Wyatt, who underscored Tubman's legacy and paralleled her to veterans.\n\n\"Aunt Harriet was one of those veterans informally,\" Wyatt said at the ceremony. \"She gave up any rights that she had obtained for herself to be able to fight for others.\"\n\nWho was Harriet Tubman?\n\nTubman was born Araminta \"Minty\" Ross in March 1822, according to the National Women's History Museum. She was one of nine children, who along with their parents, were enslaved in Dorchester County, Maryland.\n\nTubman began working in the field harvesting flax at around the age of 13 and escaped when she was around 27 years old. After she escaped, Tubman dedicated her life to the abolition of slavery, according to the National Women's History Museum.\n\nTubman returned to Maryland at least 13 times to rescue as many as 70 enslaved people through the Underground Railroad. If she had been caught, she would've faced physical punishment and been sold back into slavery in the Deep South due to the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law.\n\n\"Deeply admired by abolitionists in the North, Tubman became a trusted friend and advisor to many, which earned her a role in the Union Army as a scout, spy, nurse, and confidante of generals,\" according to the Harriet Tubman Byway website.\n\nThe U.S. Army and historians have credited Tubman as the first woman to \"lead a combat regiment when she spearheaded a Union Army raid during the Civil War.\"\n\nAfter the Civil War, Tubman became involved in the campaign for women's suffrage along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, according to the National Parks Service.\n\nShe purchased a home in Auburn, New York, in 1859 and established a home for the elderly. She died there in 1913 and was buried with military honors at Fort Hill Cemetery.\n\nLatest effort to honor abolitionist hero\n\nTubman has long been noted as an icon in American history. Several national parks, monuments, and historical sites have been established across the U.S. in honor of her legacy.\n\nNumerous schools have also been named after Tubman, including in 2022 when an elementary school in Chicago was renamed after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that 30 schools in the area were named after people with racist views and slaveholders.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Mint began selling coins — $5 gold coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar coins — to commemorate Tubman.\n\nThe commemorative coins came about 10 years after former President Barack Obama proposed to place Tubman on the $20 bill. The decision was then stalled under the Trump administration.\n\nContributing: Minnah Arshad and N'dea Yancey-Bragg, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2024/11/12/harriet-tubman-earns-new-honor-brigadier-general-maryland-national-guard/76219479007/", "title": "Harriet Tubman earns new honor: Brigadier General of MD National ...", "text": "Already universally hailed as the great abolitionist and Underground Railroad leader, you can now add at least one more well-deserved honor for Harriet Tubman: Brigadier General in the Maryland National Guard.\n\nHere's how the posthumous honor was bestowed Monday with a visit to the Eastern Shore by Maryland Gov. Wes Moore.\n\nGov. Moore: Harriet Tubman exemplified military values\n\nMoore on Monday visited the Eastern Shore to commemorate Veterans Day and to participate in ceremonies including an historic posthumous commission of Harriet Tubman as Brigadier General of the Maryland National Guard. The ceremony was held at the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park, near Church Creek in Dorchester County.\n\nThe governor was joined at the ceremony southwest of Cambridge by Maryland National Guard Maj. Gen. Janeen L. Birckhead, House Speaker Adrienne A. Jones and Del. Edith Patterson of Charles County. Along with members of the Maryland National Guard, the governor and Birckhead posthumously commissioned Tubman to the rank of brigadier general for her military service to both the United States and Maryland.\n\n“Harriet Tubman lived the values and virtues that I was taught when I served in the United States Army, and many of the people here today learned too: Live mission first, people always. Lead with honor, integrity, duty, and courage. Leave no one behind,” said Gov. Moore. “And with each act of courage, Harriet Tubman helped bring us together as a nation and a people. She fought for a kind of unity that can only be earned through danger, risk, and sacrifice. And it is a unity we still benefit from to this day.”\n\nTubman, who was born into slavery in Dorchester County, escaped in 1849 to Philadelphia — where she lived as a free woman.

Meet this year’s honorees at womenoftheyear.usatoday.com.\n\nMaj. Gen. Janeen Birckhead's career path was inspired by her mother, and four words of encouragement, although simple, determined the course of her life: \"You can do it.\"\n\nAs a United States military officer serving as Maryland's 31st adjutant general — as well as the only Black woman in the country leading a state and second woman to do so in the state’s history — Birckhead currently holds the top military position in the state after being appointed in 2023.\n\nNational heroines:USA Today Network Women of the Year\n\n\"Who knew, at some point, Gov. Wes Moore would appoint me to adjutant general of Maryland? It's a rewarding job. It's a rewarding experience,\" Birckhead said of her career.\n\nIt's an achievement she owes to her mother, the honorable Fannie Mae Ward Birckhead, a community activist and the adjutant general's biggest supporter, who died in 2022.\n\nBirckheard never truly considered a military career.\n\nThat was, however, until Birckhead's mother pushed her to apply for an ROTC scholarship at Hampton University in Virginia, a scholarship which ultimately led her on a winding path to the Army National Guard.\n\n\"She was always looking for opportunities for me, (telling me) 'You can do it, Janeen. You can do it,'\" Birckhead shared.\n\nHaving grown up in the small town of Snow Hill, Maryland, the Eastern Shore holds a special place in Birckhead's heart. Now, her heart encompasses not just Snow Hill, but the entire state of Maryland.\n\n\"Formal education, community service, public outreach and understanding the importance of work was really big in our household,\" Birckhead said. \"Helping people at home, making sure people have what they need, responding to crises — all of those things are available to us in the National Guard.\"\n\nAccording to Birckhead, the Army National Guard — founded in 1636 — is ready and able to respond at a moment's notice to do what needs to be done in an organized, well-disciplined fashion.\n\n\"Every day I wake up and (ask), 'What could we do in the National Guard to make it better?' I think that there is something we can do (to make it better) every day,\" she said of the military force.\n\nFor her work, Birckhead has been named USA TODAY's Women of the Year honoree for Maryland.\n\n“As Maryland’s adjutant general, I pledge to serve the people of Maryland with unwavering dedication,” Birckhead said in a release after her confirmation. “I believe in the importance of the National Guard's mission and above all in the selfless service of our soldiers, airmen, federal and state civilian employees, and our volunteers, who represent the best of our great state.”\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWho paved the way for you? Who did you pave the way for?\n\nMy mom — “Mommy\" — the honorable Fannie Mae Ward Birckhead, paved the way for me. She was a community leader, community activist and cared for others. Community service is what she really instilled in our family.\n\nLt. Gen. James F. Fretterd from the Eastern Shore also paved the way for me. He saw a talent in me, and said, “We've got to make sure that she's getting the mentorship she needs.” I will always be grateful to him for that support and for seeing that possibility in me.\n\nGen. Linda L. Singh, the 29th adjutant general, was also inspirational. She was certainly someone who pushed me and saw an ability in me. I also worked for Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, and by seeing how he operated, understanding the world around him and giving me my first job out of college, he set me on a trajectory.\n\nAs far as who I’ve helped pave the way for, I have planted a lot of seeds and continue to nurture those seeds. I plant the seeds, watch them grow, tend to them and pull the weeds out to ensure there are good roots established. We’ll see what comes out on the other end.\n\nOC museum to hail Black history:Ocean City will get museum about its Black history, including Duke Ellington, Count Basie\n\nWhat is your proudest moment? Do you have a lowest?\n\nMy proudest moment was the work I established with the Maryland Vaccine Equity Task Force. It was a game changer: coming up with a model and way of responding to the crisis at the time and doing that in an organized fashion. It was the first Vaccine Equity Task Force of its kind in the nation to be operational. I would also say Gov. Wes Moore selecting me for adjutant general was certainly a proud moment as well. I'm very proud of serving in this role.\n\nI would say my lowest moment was when my mom was killed in February 2022. She loomed large. There weren’t many days that went by that I didn't talk to Mommy. She was my sounding board. She was a big supporter. So, I would say that was my lowest moment, to have to pull myself out of that and continue to work through it. Fortunately, I have a wonderful family — 2 great kids and a husband — who were there during that tough time. But we all miss her.\n\nWhat is your definition of courage?\n\nMy definition of courage changes over time. To me, courage is being able to face adversity. Courage is being resilient. Resilient 6 is my military call sign because I tend to use mindfulness and other techniques in order to bounce back from adversity.\n\nIs there a guiding principle or mantra you tell yourself?\n\nDiversity, discipline and dedication. Our organization — the Maryland National Guard — is diverse, disciplined and dedicated. I look for diversity in who I am in order to be a successful individual in life. I can't do things one way. I can't just be with one people. We have to diversify.\n\nWe must consider diversity in everything we do, be disciplined enough to make a plan and stick to the plan, and always be dedicated to our organization. You'll find diversity, discipline and dedication in my command philosophy. I call it \"D to the Power of Three.\"\n\nWho did or do you look up to?\n\nI look up to Harriet Tubman, who was born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. I like to reflect on Harriet Tubman's ability to overcome adversity. Not too long ago, I went by her birthplace. I stood out in the field while the sun was setting and thought about this woman, who’s my height, coming from a house in this cornfield, walking to a creek where she's going to take people to freedom and do that time and time again. She didn't have a GPS. She didn't have a cellphone. Yet, she did it time and time again.\n\nAlso, going back to World War II, you have the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, nicknamed the \"Six Triple Eight.” The \"Six Triple Eight” was recently awarded a gold medal by the president of the United States. They are the only all-female predominantly Black organization military unit deployed during World War II, and they moved hundreds and hundreds of pieces of mail through the European Theater of Operations (ETO). That was a great accomplishment.\n\nI also look up to individuals such as Hon. Christine Wormuth, — who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and appointed as the 25th Secretary of the U.S. Army — Worcester County Commissioner Diana Purnell from Berlin, our local leaders such as Mary Beth Carozza as well as retired State Sen. Jim Mathias, who are all great leaders and people that I've known for many years. I look up to them as well, and what they do on the Shore and for the Shore.\n\n2023 Woman of the Year honoree:She helps others achieve homeownership: Meet the Maryland honoree for Women of the Year\n\nHow do you overcome adversity?\n\nI use mindfulness to overcome adversity. I do a 360 every night and ask myself, “Janine, what happened today? Why and how did that happen? Can I make a change? Is there something that I could do better?” I try to do that 360 every night, whether it's in my mind before I lay down or something intentional where I pull out a piece of paper and take notes.\n\nI think it’s important to try to digest and dissect what happened during the day. I try not to get caught up in the moment. So, for me, writing it down and having those techniques allows me to react, or act, or let it go; to find another way to deal with a situation. Sometimes you have to step back and think about it.\n\nWhat advice would you give your younger self?\n\nI would tell my younger self to continue to be resilient, and failure or adversity is not a negative thing. It can make you stronger. If there are things that other people can do, you can do it too. Also, stop procrastinating. Don't procrastinate. Those are all things that Mommy told me. Now, those are messages that I would go back and tell my younger self.\n\nOlivia Minzola covers communities on the Lower Shore.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery.\n\nFacts: Brown was a social reformer and educator who traveled the Oregon Trail and assisted in the founding of Tualatin Academy, which became Pacific University in Forest Grove. She turned to teaching to support four children after her husband, a minister, died. She was 66 when she crossed the plains in 1846 with her son and suffered much hardship. At one point on the journey, she was left alone on the trail in the bitter cold with her ailing 77-year-old brother-in-law. She pulled them through, despite being near starvation. Once in Oregon, she traveled between Oregon City and her daughter's home in Salem, and eventually settled in Forest Grove. Her first job was sewing gloves to sell. She later helped start a home and school for orphan children and became affectionately known as \"Grandma Brown.\" The log church she used for the school was officially established as Tualatin Academy in 1848, and the following year became what is now Pacific University.\n\nNotable: Honored in 1987 by the Oregon Legislature as the \"Mother of Oregon.\"\n\nQuotable: \"I rode through (the Umpqua Mountains) in three days at the risk of my life, on horseback, having lost my wagon and all that I had but the horse I was on.\"\n\nSOURCES: Pacific University, Salem Online History, RootsWeb.com, The Brown Family History II\n\nAbigail Scott Duniway\n\nBorn: Oct. 22, 1834, near Groveland, Ill.\n\nDied: Oct. 11, 1915. She is buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: Duniway was a novelist, newspaper publisher, teacher, pioneer, milliner and suffragist. She came to Oregon in 1852 and wrote a novel based on the overland experience. Her mother and brother died during the grueling trek. Her family settled near Lafayette, where she began a career as a schoolteacher. She married Benjamin Duniway, and they had four children spaced less than two years apart. She endured the loss of their Yamhill County farm because of her husband's faulty business decisions. Later, he became an invalid. In order to support the family, she returned to teaching as well as running a hat shop in Albany. Her experiences convinced her that women needed the right to vote. She campaigned for suffrage throughout the Northwest, and in 1871, started a newspaper in Portland called The New Northwest. She masterminded the suffrage campaigns in Idaho and Washington, but her efforts to win the right to vote in her home state proved more demanding. From 1884 to 1910, Oregon's male voters defeated suffrage five times at the polls. Finally, in 1912, the initiative passed. She was the first woman to register to vote in Multnomah County.\n\nNotable: Duniway was the first woman to speak before the Oregon Legislature and the state's first woman publisher.\n\nQuotable: \"The young women of today, free to study, to speak, to write, to choose their occupation, should remember that every inch of this freedom was bought for them at a great price. It is for them to show their gratitude by helping onward the reforms of their own times, by spreading the light of freedom and of truth still wider.

She is buried at Ocean View Cemetery in Warrenton.\n\nFacts: A physician, teacher, feminist and social reformer, she was the first woman west of the Mississippi to hold a medical degree. Her family crossed the Oregon Trail in 1843, and she did not begin her formal education until she was 12. She was married at 14 to one of her father's farm hands but divorced her abusive husband by 16. She turned to millinery to earn her living and raise her son, George, who also became a doctor. Her business was successful, but after six years she decided to pursue a career in medicine. She attended an eclectic school in Philadelphia and then University of Michigan Medical School, finishing her degree in 1880, at age 40. She returned to Portland the following year and became the first woman to practice in Oregon. She married Col. John Adair in 1884, and the couple moved to Astoria, where she continued to practice medicine and help with the family farm.\n\nNotable: She thought insanity and criminal action were hereditary and argued for mandatory sterilization of the criminally insane. Her famous work on the subject, \"Human Sterilization: Its Social and Legislative Aspects,\" was published in 1922. Three years later, the sterilization statute was adopted as state law in Oregon.\n\nQuotable: She was not afraid to drive great distances alone in her carriage to reach a patient. \"At no time did I ever refuse a call, day or night, rain or shine.\"\n\nSources: Oregon Historical Society, Findagrave.com, Dameron-Damron family newsletter\n\nLola Greene Baldwin\n\nBorn: 1860\n\nDied: June 22, 1957. Buried at River View Cemetery in Portland.\n\nFacts: On April 1, 1908, she was sworn in as the first female police officer in the United States. Her primary mission was to protect young women from prostitution. She began this type of work in 1905 as an employee of Portland's branch of the Traveler's Aid organization during the Lewis and Clark Exposition. The goal of the organization was to encourage women who flocked to the city to avoid the pitfalls of prostitution. Her unit with the Portland Police Bureau, the Women's Protection Division, made a priority of protecting women from the effects of vice, rather than punishing them for it. She reportedly maintained an office away from the police department and declined to work in uniform. She also was involved in organizing a juvenile court in Portland. On May 1, 1922, she resigned her commission after influencing local, regional and national women's policing activities for 17 years, 14 of them as a paid municipal officer.\n\nNotable: To learn about Baldwin, read \"A Municipal Mother,\" by Gloria E. Myers. A Portland-based foundation that helps women who are recovering from prostitution is named in her honor.\n\nQuotable: Baldwin's goal was \"to make the path safe for the feet of the girl who desired to lead a clean, honest, useful life.\"\n\nSources: Lola Greene Baldwin Foundation, \"A Municipal Mother\"\n\nMercedes Deiz\n\nBorn: 1917\n\nDied: Oct. 5, 2005, in Portland\n\nFacts: She became the first black female lawyer in Oregon when she was admitted to the bar in 1960. She attended Northwestern School of Law at night while married and raising three children and working as a legal assistant. She finished fourth in her class and years later credited her husband with taking a large part in raising their children. \"I am not a dependent woman,\" she said. \"But I could not have done the things I did without Carl.\" In November 1969, then-Gov. Tom McCall appointed her as a district court judge, making her the first woman of color to become a judge in Oregon. The following May, in the primary, Multnomah County voters elected her to the post outright and she became the first black woman to be elected to the bench in Oregon. Oregon Women Lawyers give an annual award in her name to someone who makes an outstanding contribution to promoting women and minorities in the legal profession and in the community.\n\nNotable: In 2000, on the 40th anniversary of her admission to the bar, she was recognized with the Award of Merit, the Oregon State Bar's highest honor.\n\nQuotable: \"Black has nothing to do with the color of the skin; it's a question of ethnicity. You are your race. A person has roots to whatever he or she comes from in one's ancestry.

Buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Duerksen was one of the founders of Deaconess Hospital, a predecessor of Salem Hospital. A group of Mennonites came to Salem in 1916 and opened a 12-bed hospital in an old hotel on Winter Street. Sister Anna, a graduate of Evangelical Deaconess Hospital School of Nursing in St. Louis, Mo., was one of four Mennonite sisters on the Board of Trustees. The sisters worked 20-hour days and received no salary until Social Security was launched in 1935. To them, it was a calling, not a job. Duerksen served as the hospital's only anesthetist. She lived in the basement and not only cared for patients, but cooked and did housekeeping. She married the hospital's gardener and worked at the hospital into the 1950s. In 1947, the Mennonites turned the hospital over to a board of Salem citizens, and the name was changed to Salem Memorial Hospital. It merged in 1969 with Salem General Hospital to create the hospital that exists today.\n\nNotable: In 1957, Duerksen was recognized by the Oregon Nurses Association with a life membership for her long leadership in providing health care.\n\nQuotable: Her legacy is well-documented in the annals of Salem Hospital. Ted Stang, a longtime local hospital administrator, met Duerksen after he came to Salem in 1968. She was in her 80s. He also heard many stories from the grandson of Deaconess Hospital's first administrator. \"She was diminutive, quiet, unassuming,\" Stang said. \"But boy, was she a powerhouse. People listened to what Sister Anna had to say, even though she was not the administrator. Sister Anna carried a lot of weight at that institution.\"\n\nSources: Salem History Online, Oregon Statesman, Salem Hospital\n\nSarah Winnemucca\n\nBorn: About 1844\n\nDied: Oct. 17, 1891\n\nFacts: Historians have referred to Winnemucca as the most famous Native American woman on the Pacific Coast. She used her language skills to try to be a peacemaker and was the first Native American woman to publish in English. Her book, \"Life Among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims,\" is an autobiographical account of her people and their contact with explorers and settlers. She was born and raised in Nevada but spent much of her life in southeastern Oregon as an interpreter for an agent at Malheur Reservation and as a scout and mediator for the Army during the Bannock War. She learned to read and write when her grandfather placed her in the home of a white family in Nevada. By the time she was 14, she could speak three Indian dialects, English and Spanish. She married at least twice, to an Army lieutenant and then an Indian Department employee. After the Bannock War, she received national attention by campaigning for Native American education programs and reservation reform — making more than 400 speeches. She even pleaded her cause to President Rutherford B. Hayes in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly received promises that were later broken. Winnemucca also opened and ran the first school in the West where Native American children could remain with their families and were not forced to stop speaking their native language.\n\nNotable: On March 9, 2005, a bronze statue of her representing Nevada was unveiled in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Willson was the first teacher at the Oregon Institute, which was founded by Methodist missionaries and later became Willamette University. She devoted her life to bringing religion and education to Oregon, and particularly to educating the young women of Salem. She traveled with about 50 new missionary recruits to the Oregon Territory in 1839. The following year, at a new mission outpost in the Puget Sound, she met her husband, William H. Willson. In 1844, the couple was asked to move to the settlement called Chemeketa Plains, which would become Salem. Chloe had been chosen to open the Oregon Institute.\n\nShe was both teacher and housemother for five primary-grade students and remained the only teacher the first two years. The board of the institute chartered \"Wallamet University\" in 1853 and began offering higher education. Chloe left Salem for a time after her husband died, but she returned in 1863 to serve as Governess of the Ladies Department at Willamette University, the equivalent of Dean of Women.\n\nNotable: Her husband is remembered as the founder of Salem because he filed the first plat of the city and held the original title to the land that now comprises Willamette University, the state Capitol and downtown Salem. Their name lives on today in Willson Park, directly west of the Capitol.\n\nQuotable: \"I feel the weight of responsibility which rests upon me in giving character to this infant institution,\" she wrote on Aug. 13, 1844, the first day of classes at the Oregon Institute. \"O my Father ... thou seest the desire of my heart for the prosperity of this institution, but without thy blessing it can never prosper.\"\n\nSources: Salem Online History, \"Journals of Brewer and Clarke\"\n\nHallie Parrish Hinges\n\nBorn: Jan. 30, 1868.\n\nDied: Jan. 25, 1950. She is buried at Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem.\n\nFacts: Hinges was a vocal performer in Oregon for nearly 60 years, most famous for her performance during President Theodore Roosevelt's visit to Salem on May 21, 1903. Roosevelt called her the \"Oregon Nightingale\" when he heard her sing, and the nickname stuck. She studied music at Willamette University, graduating from the Willamette Conservatory when she was 18. She also studied in New York for a year. Music always was a big part of her life. She performed at her first public concert when she was 6, in the basement of First Methodist Church. Her audiences later expanded to political dignitaries. In 1891, she sang for President Benjamin Harrison, and in 1900, she performed for Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan. But her biggest moment came when Roosevelt visited Salem. Thousands gathered at Willson Park to see the president. Before he spoke, the 35-year-old soprano sang the national anthem. Roosevelt told Gov. George Chamberlain that Hinges had one of the most beautiful voices he had ever heard and asked if she would sing again. Hinges responded with a favorite of the time, \"The Flag Without a Stain,\" and witnesses claimed that the president wiped tears from his eyes.\n\nQuotable: \"Truly, she is the Oregon Nightingale,\" Roosevelt said.\n\nNotable: Hinges' grandfather was Methodist missionary Josiah L. Parrish, whom Parrish Middle School is named after.\n\nSource: The Statesman Journal, Salem Online History, \"Marion County History,\" Volume XV\n\nThelma Payne Sanborn\n\nBorn: July 18, 1896, in Silverton\n\nDied: Sept. 7, 1988, in Los Angeles\n\nFacts: She was the first Oregon woman to compete in the Olympics and the first to win a medal. She won the bronze in the 3-meter springboard diving competition at the 1920 Olympic Games in Antwerp, Belgium. The U.S. swept the medals in that event, with Payne missing silver by seven-tenths of a point. She was the U.S. women's springboard champion in 1918, 1919 and 1920, and trained at Multnomah Athletic Club in Portland. She reportedly incorporated ballet into her training regimen. After competing in the Olympics, she was a longtime swimming and diving coach at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. She taught the children of several famous people to swim, including John Wayne and Bing Crosby. Payne was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of fame in 1983, among one of the early classes that included Bobby Doerr, Mel Renfro and Steve Prefontaine.\n\nNotable: Sanborn said in a 1987 interview that she was one of the models for the red-suited diving girl introduced by Jantzen in 1920 and later plastered on billboards.\n\nQuotable: \"In those days, we had nothing to go by. We had to actually see someone perform a dive and then try to do it ourselves.

She came to Oregon in 1905 for the position of secretary of the Oregon Library Commission, which later became the State Library. She instituted many innovative programs, including the first books-by-mail service in the country. In a day when many Oregonians lived isolated lives without telephones, newspapers and other regular sources of information, her innovation was a lifeline for thousands of rural Oregonians, particularly women. She resigned as State Librarian in 1928 to marry Gov. Walter M. Pierce. He was elected in 1932 to Congress, and she became his secretary, researcher and speech writer. Their political partnership was one he readily recognized, often reminding his constituents that they had two representatives for the price of one.\n\nQuotable: \"The only thing I have ever done to make the world a better place to live is to promote libraries.\"\n\nNotable: At the end of her life, she bequeathed most of her estate to Reed College, a private Portland liberal-arts school.

She and her husband, Richard, were known as a political team. They gained notice in 1951 as the first married couple in the nation to serve together in a legislature — he in the Oregon Senate and she in the House. He won a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1954, and she served as his aide. When he died from a cerebral hemorrhage in 1960, she won a special election to fill the vacancy and then the general election to serve the next term. She focused on environmental and health issues, including sponsorship of one of the first bills to require warning labels on cigarette packaging. Back home, she took on Oregon's then-powerful dairy industry about a law forbidding the sale of yellow margarine. She donned a striped apron, pulled out a mixing bowl and showed her colleagues in the House — all men — just how much work it took to mix food coloring into the lard-white butter substitute. The ban was lifted, and her demonstration became part of the state's political lore.\n\nQuotable: \"Before she puts her name on the ballot, she encounters prejudice and people saying, 'A women's place is in the home.' She has to walk a very tight wire in conducting her campaign. She can't be too pussyfooting or mousy. Also, she can't go to the other extreme — belligerent, coarse, nasty.\"\n\nNotable: After serving in the U.S. Senate, she taught at Boston University and Radcliffe and was part of the social and academic circle surrounding the Kennedy family.\n\nSources: Oregon History Project, Harvard Square Library\n\nMercedes Bates\n\nBorn: 1916\n\nDied: Aug. 16, 1997, in Minneapolis\n\nFacts: Bates is one of the most important women to graduate from Oregon State University. She is credited with helping make Betty Crocker a household name. She was a vice president of the General Mills food company, in charge of the Betty Crocker division. The fictional character was created in 1921 and evolved into an American cultural icon under Bates' direction. After graduating from Oregon State in 1936 with a degree in food and nutrition, Bates began working at the Southern California Gas Co. and became supervisor of home service. She then moved to the Globe Mills food company before opening her own business in Hollywood as an advertising food consultant. She later joined the staff of McCall's magazine as food editor before moving to General Mills in 1964 as director of the Betty Crocker kitchens. Two years later, she rose through the ranks to become vice president and the first female corporate officer of General Mills. She held that title until retiring in 1983.\n\nNotable: She donated $3 million to Oregon State in the early 1990s, helping establish a nationally renowned Bates Family Study Center on campus. At that time, it was the largest one-time donation ever made to OSU. The facility opened in 1992 and was the first of its kind in the United States. It houses programs of research, instruction and outreach designed to benefit individuals and families.\n\nSources: Oregon State University, OSU Alumni Association\n\nNan Wood Honeyman\n\nBorn: July 15, 1881.\n\nDied: Dec. 10, 1970.

She married David Honeyman in 1908, raised three children and was active in civic and humanitarian organizations before becoming involved in politics. She served as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933, which ratified the 21st Amendment to the United States Constitution, repealing prohibition. She was a state representative from 1935 to 1937 before being elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Congress. Her bids for re-election in 1938 and election in 1940 failed. While working in the Pacific Coast office of the U.S. Price Administration, the Multnomah County commissioners appointed Honeyman to the Oregon Senate in 1941 to fill a vacancy, and she served until her resignation in 1942. She was U.S. collector of customs in Portland from 1942 to 1953.\n\nNotable: After graduating in 1898 from St. Helens Hall (later incorporated in the Oregon Episcopal School), she continued her education at the Finch School in New York City, where she began a lifelong friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nSources: Oregon Blue Book, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\n\nCarolyn Shelton\n\nBorn: Around 1877.\n\nDied: Unknown.\n\nFacts: Shelton was governor for a day in 1909, according to the Capital Journal. The newspaper ran a banner headline proclaiming her head of state Feb. 27, 1909, following the resignation of Gov. George E. Chamberlain and the delay in swearing in Secretary of State Frank W. Benson, the next in line. Chamberlain resigned his seat after being elected to the U.S. Senate. In a hurry to get to Washington, D.C., he left his resignation with his private secretary, Shelton, about 9 a.m. that Saturday. The papers weren't to be filed until 4 p.m. Monday, and Benson couldn't be sworn in right away, so there effectively was no governor except Shelton. The Capital Journal pronounced her \"the first woman to govern any state.\" The newspaper reported Sunday that Benson assumed control at 10:10 a.m. Nowhere in state records is Shelton mentioned as governor. Barbara Roberts officially would become the first female governor of Oregon when she was elected and served from 1991 to 1995.\n\nQuotable: \"I want to fill the governor's shoes, and he really has a small foot,\" Shelton was quoted as saying in the Capital Journal. \"I fear the principal trouble will be in trying to fill his hat.\"\n\nNotable: \"Time\" magazine reported July 26, 1926, that Chamberlain, 72, married Carolyn B. Shelton, 49, in Norfolk, Va. Shelton was clerk to the Senate Military Affairs Committee when Chamberlain was chairman during World War I. Chamberlain's first wife had died the previous year.\n\nSource: The Capital Journal\n\nMary Purvine\n\nBorn: Feb. 26, 1881.\n\nDied: June 10, 1965.

She left Salem after graduating at age 22, and launched her practice in the small Eastern Oregon town of Condon, where her brother and future governor of Oregon, Jay Bowerman, practiced law. Purvine returned to Salem after four years and began a medical practice specializing in obstetrics. She and her husband, Ellis, had three children. Her son, Ralph, followed in her footsteps and became a doctor. Mary Purvine was a member of the staffs at Salem General and Salem Memorial hospitals. She maintained a practice in Salem for more than half a century, working for many years out of her home on University Street SE. She practiced medicine until she was well into her 70s.\n\nNotable: Her book, \"Pioneer Doctor,\" was published in 1958.\n\nQuotable: \"Woman doctors were few in the early days of my practice.

The Native American woman, who married a white settler named Frank Riddle, was rewarded a government pension of $25 per month for helping save lives during the Modoc War of 1872-73. She and her husband acted as interpreters, messengers and mediators between her people and the U.S. Army. She is perhaps best known for having warned Gen. Edward Canby about the Modoc plot to kill him during peace negotiations. The general ignored the advice and was killed April 11, 1873. On the same day, Winema was credited for saving the life of Alfred Meacham, a Methodist minister and the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Oregon. Meacham was wounded and about to be scalped when Winema yelled that the soldiers were coming, sending the Modoc warriors running. Meacham was the one who pressed Congress to give her a pension, which she received until she died.\n\nNotable: The Winema National Forest in Southern Oregon was established in 1961 and named after her.\n\nSources: Trover Studio collection, courtesy of the Oregon State Library\n\nElizabeth Lord and Edith Schryver\n\nElizabeth Lord\n\nBorn: Nov. 12, 1887, in Salem.\n\nDied: Oct. 9, 1976.

She is buried in her family plot in Kingston, N.Y.\n\nFacts: Lord and Schryver became the first female professionals to open a landscape-architecture firm in the Northwest in 1929. They designed more than 250 gardens from Eugene to Seattle. Schryver was considered the design genius and Lord the plant expert and businesswoman with connections. Lord grew up in Salem and was the daughter of a former Oregon governor, William Lord. Schryver grew up in New York and attended the Lowthrope School of Landscape Architecture in Massachusetts, where Lord also studied. A few years after Schryver graduated, she set sail for a garden tour of Europe, where she met Lord. The friends traveled and studied together for several months and then Lord brought Schryver to Salem. Two of their most notable imprints on Salem are the gardens at Historic Deepwood Estate and Bush's Pasture Park.\n\nQuotable: \"We were free-swinging career girls, and nobody ever questioned us,\" Schryver told the Statesman Journal in 1980.\n\nNotable: The Lord & Schryver Conservancy works to preserve and interpret the legacy of the two women.\n\nSources: Statesman Journal, Lord & Schryver Conservancy\n\nMinnie Hill\n\nBorn: 1863 in Albany.\n\nDied: January 1946 in San Francisco.\n\nFacts: Hill was the first female steamboat captain west of the Mississippi. On Dec. 1, 1886, at age 23, she was granted a master's and pilot's license. She had been working with her husband, Charles O. Hill, on various boats for several years and became \"thoroughly conversant with the steamboat business,\" according to \"Lewis & Dryden's Marine History of the Pacific Northwest.\" When Charles and Minnie bought the 112-foot Governor Newell in 1889, Charles went down into the engine room while Minnie took the pilothouse wheel. They specialized in moving scows laden with jetty stone from a quarry east of Vancouver, Wash., downstream to meet a U.S. Army Engineer tow boat, which took the loads to Astoria. The stone was used to build the south jetty at the mouth of the Columbia River. Minnie was a captain for 14 years. At least two movie producers supposedly tried to get her to consent to filming her life story, but she refused.\n\nNotable: She reportedly was the only woman on the Pacific Coast licensed to command a steamer until 1907, when a second-class master's and pilot's license was granted to a woman in the Puget Sound area.\n\nQuotable: Her son, Herbert W.

She was editor of The Advocate, an African-American newspaper published in Portland between 1903 and 1936, regularly challenging racial discrimination and becoming the unofficial spokeswoman for the city's small black community. She helped found the Portland chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, known as the NAACP, and craft the state's first civil-rights legislation, which would have mandated full access to public accommodations without regard to race. Although that piece of legislation failed, in 1925 she worked on the successful campaign to repeal Oregon's notorious exclusion laws, which prohibited African Americans from settling in the state.\n\nQuotable: \"Not even the pulpit has been as effective for the advancement of our group, and for justice, as the press.\"\n\nNotable: She ran for state representative in May 1932 but was not elected.

She is buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Corbett.\n\nFacts: Green was a Democrat in the United States Congress who helped push through legislation that led to Title IX. A former school teacher, radio commentator and lobbyist, she became an important figure in Oregon politics when she was elected to Congress in 1955. She served 10 terms and focused on women's issues, education and social reforms. In her first term, she proposed the Equal Pay Act to ensure that men and women were paid equally for equal work. The bill was signed into law eight years later. She is most noted for her work developing the legislation that was to become Title IX, which prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. She introduced a higher-education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on that bill, together with significant input from Rep. Patsy Mink and Sen. Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of Title IX in 1972.\n\nQuotable: Sen.

Among the 6,000 or so students who sat in her classes were current teachers and politicians, including retired U.S. Sen. Mark Hatfield. She was a strong role model for a generation of up-and-coming women including Norma Paulus, who praised Eyre's work for equal rights for women, open government meetings and the preservation of historic buildings. Eyre came to Salem in 1904, when she was 6. She graduated from Willamette University in 1918 and began her teaching career in Salem in 1922. She taught history and government, economics and sociology, retiring in 1962. In addition to her contributions as an educator, she was involved in local government. She was a precinct committee member and president of the local chapter of the League of Women Voters, and ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic candidate for the state Senate in 1962.\n\nQuotable: She said she ran for the legislative office because she \"wanted to try out some of the things I had been teaching over the years.\"\n\nNotable: The Salem-Keizer School District named an elementary school in her honor in 1977.

Oswald West in January 1914 to declare martial law in Copperfield, perhaps Oregon's most notorious \"bad\" town. Copperfield was established in 1908 to house the mining and railroad crews working at Snake River. It had three saloons, including one owned by the mayor and another by a city councilman, and a population of 84 when Hobbs was dispatched. West had vowed personally to clean up the vice-ridden town but was warned that he would be shot if he tried, so he sent his private secretary. Described as a diminutive woman — 5-foot-3 and less than 100 pounds — Hobbs arrived with a small National Guard contingent and read the governor's orders to close the saloons and resign from city council. The orders were refused, Hobbs left town that afternoon and the National Guard placed the town under martial law. More troops eventually arrived and confiscated liquor and gambling devices. The town, about 75 miles northeast of Baker City, later was destroyed by fire and today is known as Oxbow.\n\nSources: Oregon State Archives, The Oregon Journal, The Oregon Statesman\n\nMarie Dorion\n\nBorn: Unknown\n\nDied: Sept. 5, 1850.

The courageous Native American accompanied her husband and two small children on the journey. Like her predecessor on the Lewis and Clark expedition, Sacagawea, Dorion earned respect from the men. She never complained about the hardships along the journey and kept pace despite caring for two children and giving birth to a third. The epitome of Dorion's courage was noted after the expedition had reached what would later be named Astoria. She and her family returned with a trapping party to the Snake River, where Indians attacked and killed all but her and her two sons. They escaped by hiding in the brush. In the wake of the tragedy, including the death of her husband, she and the boys survived more than 50 days in the bitter cold of the Blue Mountains.\n\nQuotable: Roger Howard, who lives near the church in Gervais, on the legend of Marie Dorion: \"She should be as famous as Sacagawea.\"\n\nSource: Statesman Journal\n\nBetty Roberts\n\nBorn: Feb. 5, 1923.\n\nNow: June 25, 2011.\n\nFacts: Roberts was the first woman appointed to the Oregon Court of Appeals (1977) and the first woman appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court (1982). She was married and raising four children in the 1950s, when she signed up for college courses and graduated from Portland State University in 1958. She taught high school and by 1962 had a master's degree in political science from the University of Oregon. She then enrolled in the night program at Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and Clark College, continued to teach and was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives. She graduated from law school in 1966, the same year one daughter graduated from Stanford University and a son from high school. She married a lawyer and legislative colleague two years later, and they established a successful legal practice. She then became the lone woman in the Oregon Senate and in 1974, ran a strong statewide campaign for governor but was narrowly defeated in the primary. The Democratic Party named her to fill a vacancy on the ballot for the general election against U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, and again she was narrowly defeated. The Oregon Women's Political Caucus named her the 1975 \"Woman of the Year\" for setting a precedent for other women to run for statewide office.\n\nNotable: She helped found Women's Investment Network-PAC to recruit and support women to run for the Legislature and Oregon Women Lawyers to promote women and minorities in the profession.

She was active in her neighborhood association and the local transit district board before running for office. She defeated two sitting city councilors (one man and one woman) in the primary and then went on to serve three terms. Being the first female mayor didn't seem like a big deal at the time, perhaps because Norma Paulus had laid the groundwork for women to become political leaders in Salem. Paulus served in the Oregon Legislature before becoming the first woman in Oregon history to win a state office in 1976, when she was elected Secretary of State. \"If Norma hadn't been so successful,\" Miller said, \"it would have been a lot harder. She had kind of tilled that ground for others to follow, and I've always thanked her for that.\" As mayor, Miller was most noted for her work in helping the city purchase 22 acres of waterfront property on the Willamette River, which today is Riverfront Park.\n\nQuotable: \"It was an amazing privilege to be mayor of Salem.

A native Oregonian, she was among the first women to enlist in the military in 1942, in what was called the Women's Army Corps (WAC). She started as an Army truck driver but soon became an officer. She spent most of World War II training thousands of WACs. She left active duty after the war and went to Lewis & Clark College in her hometown of Portland. She then returned to active duty and joined the Air Force. She was the war plans officer at one of the major bases in Europe during the Berlin Airlift and began her rise through the ranks. She was Director of Women in the Air Force from 1965 to 1973. She was promoted to brigadier general in 1971, the first woman to be appointed to that grade in the Air Force. Two years later, she became the first woman in any branch of service to reach the rank of major general, or two-star general. She retired in 1975 after a 33-year career in the Air Force and went on to serve as Special Assistant on women's issues for President Gerald Ford. She also held positions during the Carter and Reagan administrations and is recognized as a driving force behind women achieving opportunities and equal rights in the military.\n\nNotable: Holm authored three books.\n\nQuotable: \"There was an enormous desire to be part of the war effort.

She sponsored environmental legislation, civil rights and ethical changes. She was the Republican candidate for governor in 1986, but lost in a closely-contested race to Neil Goldschmidt. Four years later, Paulus was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction and led a comprehensive restructuring of the state's public school system. She spearheaded work to set rigorous academic standards for all students and to increase accountability with state testing standards. In 1996, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley named her to the National Assessment Governing Board. A New York Times profile described Paulus' work in Oregon as the most cutting-edge school reform in the country.\n\nQuotable: \"I know I have made government more accountable. It's been a really rewarding experience to be involved in Oregon's state government because in our state, one person can still make a difference.\"\n\nNotable: Paulus never went to college. She was admitted to Willamette Law School in 1956, based on her test scores and the personal recommendation of State Supreme Court Justice Earl C. Latourette.

Her efforts resulted in one of the nation's first special-education laws and propelled her rise in politics to the governorship. She served on the Parkrose School Board, the Mt. Hood Community College Board and the Multnomah County Commission before her election to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1981. During her second term, she became Oregon's first woman House majority leader. In 1984, she was elected secretary of state, the first Democrat elected to that post in more than 100 years. She was re-elected in 1988. She ran unopposed in the Democratic primary for governor in 1990, and was elected to succeed Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. During her four-year term, Roberts was recognized as an advocate for public education, human rights and services, environmental management and streamlining state government.\n\nQuotable: \"You are looking at a woman who raised two children - one of them autistic - by herself. You are looking at a person who struggled for years to make ends meet. You are looking at a part-time student still working and committed to earning my college degree. And you are looking at a woman who got actively involved because she saw a wrong that needed to be righted. And today you are looking at the governor of the greatest state in the union. Am I proud? You bet I am. Will I make a difference for Oregon? I've never wished more for anything.\" - Excerpt from her inaugural address in 1991.\n\nNotable: During her term, Oregon was recognized in 1993 by financial World Magazine as the seventh-best managed state in the nation.

She lives in Portland.\n\nFacts: Allison was the first American woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 1988. She grew up in Woodburn and graduated from Oregon State University in 1984. Her first climbing lesson was on a 50-foot Douglas fir on the Corvallis campus, and she was hooked. She tackled rocks first, then mountains. She was part of the first successful women's ascent of Ama Dablam in 1983. From the summit, she could see the rising crest of Everest and set her sights on the world's tallest mountain. Her first attempt was unsuccessful because of a snowstorm that left the climbing party trapped in a snow cave for five days. But the following year, in 1988, she was triumphant. On Sept. 29, at the age of 29, after 29 days on the mountain, she made history by becoming the first American woman to stand on top of the 29,035-foot mountain. She went on to lead a successful expedition in 1993 at K2, the world's second tallest mountain.\n\nQuotable: \"Climbing has inspired me, shaped my life, and changed it. Climbing has given me confidence and strength. It has taught me how to be resourceful, how to challenge myself and trust myself enough to take risks.

Prior to entering politics, she enjoyed a career as a broadcast journalist. She graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in communications and worked for Oregon Public Radio and later for KVAL-TV in Eugene. Her political career began in 1996, when she was appointed by the Lane County commissioners to fill a vacancy in the Oregon Senate, then won re-election in 1998. She became vice-chairwoman of the Education Committee, dealing with such issues as charter schools, teacher tenure and school reform. She served in the Senate through 2002, and then was elected State Superintendent of Public Instruction. She held that office from 2003 to 2012, overseeing a department serving more than a half-million students in more than 1,200 schools. She was an advocate for students of color and those from low-income households, supporting increased Head Start coverage, full-day kindergarten, and English for second-language learners. After resigning, she joined the nonprofit education organization Project Lead the Way as its western regional vice president.\n\nQuotable: \"I grew up in a household where my mother dropped out in the eighth grade and was very challenged throughout her life on the kind of work that was available to her.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/11/25/national-guard-scandals-by-state/6093566001/", "title": "National Guard scandals include sexual misconduct, coverups ...", "text": "Corrections and clarifications: This story originally misreported when The Washington Post reported on cronyism in the New Jersey National Guard. That story was published in 2015.\n\nThe National Guard system – crucial to America's military defense and vital to state emergency operations – is reeling from corruption and misconduct that reflect overarching command failures, a USA TODAY investigation has found.\n\nFor more than two decades, state Guards from Alaska to California to Delaware have been shaken by scandals, often exposed by whistleblowers who are subjected to retaliation amid coverups.\n\nIn Maryland, a Black soldier was taunted and forced to wear chains as punishment.\n\nIn Vermont, an Air Guard commander allegedly flew a fighter jet to the nation's capital, where he had a tryst with a Pentagon official.\n\nIn state after state, soldiers have been sexually assaulted or harassed, only to suffer reprisal from executive officers.\n\nThroughout the National Guard system, which consists of 54 independent state and territorial militias, soldiers and airmen have complained for decades about abuses that suggest a failure of culture and oversight.\n\nRead the story:Despite decades of corrupt conduct, state National Guards have resisted reforms\n\nCritics contend that pervasive corruption and a lack of transparency betray America's nearly 445,000 National Guard troops while shielding culprits, even as Guard units are relied upon more than ever.\n\n“It’s a structural deficit of accountability,” said Dwight Stirling, a California National Guard attorney and director of the Center for Law and Military Policy. “What you get there is one thing – corruption.\"\n\nThe lion’s share of soldiers and airmen maintain military values. They hunt drug smugglers, provide disaster relief, fight wildfires and support pandemic efforts while serving as a war-time reserve force for the regular U.S. military.\n\nIn state after state, however, records show Guard scandals have led to cover-ups and retaliation against whistleblowers.\n\nAlaska\n\nA 2015 report by the Pentagon and a special state investigation a year later characterized the Alaska National Guard climate as seething with sexual abuse, fraud and other misconduct.\n\nSoldiers so distrusted the leadership that they turned to chaplains, who as whistleblowers complained that “a culture of fear and corruption” was smothering Guard members.\n\nFlorida\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis replaced the Florida National Guard’s adjutant general two years ago amid revelations of sexual abuse, coverups and reprisal.\n\nA member of the Judge Advocate General Corps, Maj. Elliot Potter, exposed the misconduct, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He alleged that the second-highest officer in the Florida Guard had “actively concealed evidence of sexual misconduct and other violence committed against soldiers” for years, the Times reported.\n\nA civilian contractor in the case submitted a sworn statement that the officer, Brig. Gen. Mike Canzoneri, approached her at a conference and \"slowly ran his hand from one side of my bare shoulder to the other.\" She alleged Canzoneri had an affair with a subordinate and transferred her when she declined to sexually accommodate his friends.\n\nCanzoneri was accused of covering up for misconduct by a colleague, Lt. Col. Scott L. Taylor. An inspector general letter concluded that Taylor brought “discredit to the Florida National Guard,” yet he was promoted six months later.\n\nKansas\n\nIn 2017, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported on racism and a toxic culture within the Kansas National Guard. Investigators uncovered enlistment fraud, sexual abuse, retaliation, cronyism, and cover-ups.\n\nA lieutenant colonel who said a Black sergeant dressed like a pimp and was a “tongue-chewing retard” was admonished for having “little regard for soldiers under his care.\" Then he was promoted to full colonel.\n\nAn investigative report stressed that the Kansas Guard’s longtime adjutant general, Maj. Gen. Lee Tafanelli, should stop shielding personnel from accountability. It warned that without reforms there would be continued “fear of reprisals, threats and more toxic leadership.” Tafanelli, who deflected questions at the time, survived the furor and retired from the Kansas Guard’s top leadership post last year.\n\nMaryland\n\nA Black sergeant in the Maryland National Guard was forced to carry a heavy chain during training exercises while being hectored by white supervisors, according to a scathing report from the National Guard Bureau's Office of Equity and Inclusion.\n\nSgt. Bruce Weaver, who was ordered to haul the chain during three days of training, told USA TODAY the treatment resembled punishment by enslavers.\n\nInvestigators substantiated 11 counts of discrimination and one of harassment. Their report accused Maryland of violating Weaver's right to due process.\n\nState militia leaders, who had exonerated the officers following internal probes, denounced the bureau's conclusions as biased. The Guard announced later that it wouldn't challenge the findings.\n\nMinnesota\n\nThis year, the Star Tribune reported that Minnesota's Guard has \"no consistent or timely system for handling sexual assault cases\" after the newspaper obtained records that showed just nine criminal prosecutions resulted from 112 assaults over six years.\n\nState lawmakers removed sexual assault investigations from National Guard authority.\n\nThe change, which garnered bipartisan support, places military sexual crimes under jurisdiction of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\n\nMissouri\n\nIn 2014, Lt. Col. Michael Fayette told the Columbia Daily Tribune he was falsely accused of misconduct after he tried to expose state Guard discrimination based on race, gender and sexual orientation.\n\nFayette, a soldier of 25 years, had served as deputy inspector general for the Army National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon before he took a position as policy director in Missouri’s Guard.\n\nAfter becoming a whistleblower, Fayette alleged, he became a target for reprisal from Adjutant General Steve Danner, who at the time served as chairman of the National Guard Association of the United States.\n\nLike many such controversies, this one alleged that the initial wrongdoing was compounded when leaders protected perpetrators and betrayed those who supported victims of abuse.\n\n“If you stand up for the gay officer, if you stand up for the Black officer, if you stand up for the lady who is suing over a hostile work environment against a general … they will destroy you,” Fayette told the Tribune. “They don’t care if you are dying, they don’t care if you have no money. … They will do whatever they can do to get you and put you into a submissive hold you can’t get out of.”\n\nThe controversy reportedly led to investigations by the Department of Defense and the Army’s Office of the Inspector General. Findings have not been divulged.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nIn the regular Army, physical fitness and weight requirements are strictly enforced. In the National Guard, not so much.\n\nSoldiers and airmen describe a system in which cronies help one another cheat or simply skip testing by claiming medical exemptions.\n\nThis came to a head in New Jersey in 2015 after a Washington Post story headlined, “Inside Chris Christie’s militia, flab and cronyism trigger mutiny in the ranks.”\n\nThe article noted that the New Jersey governor's first appointment to lead the Guard, a childhood pal, had to resign after staffers caught him having an affair at work.\n\nThe governor’s next pick, Brig. Gen. Michael Cunniff, was reprimanded by the Defense Department for failing to fulfill fitness requirements. Christie ordered Cunniff to meet military standards.\n\nIn New Jersey, as elsewhere, the weight issue was a symptom of larger problems in the Guard. According to the Post, junior officers had written to the governor complaining about a “demeaning and toxic” command culture, and the state’s top Black and Hispanic officers complained to him about racial discrimination. Their letter warned about a climate of “mistrust, secrecy, intimidation, deception, favoritism, cronyism and unethical behavior.”\n\nBrian Scully, a retired Army colonel, told the Post he was fired after helping expose the extramarital affair involving Christie’s friend. He compared New Jersey’s Guard to a mafia: “One minute you’re the made man. The next, you get a bullet in the back of your head. Only here it’s career assassination.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nIn August, after a Philadelphia Inquirer series on misconduct in the Pennsylvania National Guard, members of Congress began pressing leadership for answers and reforms.\n\nAgain, sexual abuse and harassment were at the forefront. According to the Inquirer, one officer and others described the 111th Attack Wing as “a frat-boy atmosphere where rape jokes are tolerated, beer steins in the base bar feature images of naked women, and a high-ranking pilot’s 'call sign' was a reference to the act of a man ejaculating inside a woman.”\n\nThere was another familiar element: The newspaper reported that harassment and discrimination were coupled with reprisal against anyone who dared speak out.\n\nTennessee\n\nMinutes after WSMV-TV in Nashville aired a 2016 story about a Tennessee National Guard recruiter who was stopped for drunk driving, someone launched a Molotov cocktail at the home of a suspected whistleblower.\n\nThe television station had revealed that the recruiter had been busted with a young recruit and numerous open containers of alcohol in the vehicle. After pleading guilty to a lesser charge, the noncommissioned officer received a promotion rather than discipline.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Tennessee’s adjutant general, Maj. Gen. Terry Hastin, whether he was concerned about possible retaliation against one of his soldiers, he responded, “Not at all,\" according to WSMV.\n\nTexas\n\nA lieutenant colonel, who was kicked out of the Texas National Guard this year for being overweight, claimed other officers in the same physical shape were not removed.\n\nCendy Brister-Antley, a nurse and administration officer who held a desk job, told KXAN-TV in Austin she was being singled out and \"fat-shamed.\"\n\nInternal Guard emails obtained by KXAN indicated the weight rule is arbitrarily enforced, leading to “the perception of targeting.”\n\n\"I do feel it's discrimination,\" Brister-Antley said. \"I don’t understand why they’re kicking out people that gained weight? Are we suddenly less intelligent, because we gained weight?”\n\nVermont\n\nIn 2018, the news site VTDigger published a six-part series on mistreatment of women, alcohol abuse, favoritism, fraud and other corrupt behavior in the Vermont National Guard.\n\nThe articles noted that the Guard in Vermont dates to the Green Mountain Boys, a unit that won a historic victory in the Revolutionary War. The stories depicted a “good ol’ boys’ club” of airmen who ran a private drinking club on base, sexually harassed female personnel and were seldom held accountable.\n\nThe Vermont Guard’s F-16 wing commander was removed after he allegedly flew a fighter jet to Washington, D.C., for meetings and a tryst with a female colonel. (F-16s, which cost about $8,000 per hour to operate, are not authorized for administrative travel.) According to VTDigger, Col. Thomas Jackman Jr. was allowed to retire without penalties or loss of his top-secret clearance.\n\nMeanwhile, the whistleblower who reported Jackman’s behavior – Lt. Col. Jeff Rector – was accused of multiple offenses, including making a threat. VTDigger reported the supposed threat was an email to superiors indicating Rector would turn to Congress if the Guard did not act.\n\nRector was escorted off the base by an armed guard, stripped of security clearance and issued an other-than-honorable discharge. (After media coverage, the news site reported, Rector’s top-secret clearance was reinstated and his discharge status was revised.)\n\nThis year, Seven Days, an alternative weekly paper in Vermont, reported that a noncommissioned officer facing multiple rape charges managed to remain in the Guard for years despite numerous convictions, including those for violent incidents that restricted him from possessing firearms.\n\nGuard leaders said they were not aware of Staff Sgt. Daniel Blodgett’s rap sheet. They cited privacy statutes in declining to reveal whether he’d been disciplined.\n\nAfter a public outcry, Gov. Phil Scott called for better oversight. “I believe that we will see change and that we will have a better system as a result of this situation,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nTeresa James earned a Bronze Star in while serving in Iraq. She was praised as an \"exceptionally exemplary\" soldier – until 2012 when she reported a sexual assault by a superior officer the West Virginia National Guard.\n\nJames was among seven women who accused the colonel of sexual misconduct. Her complaint was substantiated by a National Guard Bureau investigation.\n\nIt didn't matter. Suddenly, James said, performance reviews went from stellar to subpar. Her promotion to colonel was denied. Reluctantly, she ended her career with a medical retirement.\n\nCap Times investigation:The National Guard welcomes and promotes women. That is, until they report a sexual assault\n\n\"You go from hero to zero in a matter of hours,\" James said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nLeft to its own devices, the Wisconsin National Guard botched at least 33 sexual assault investigations, ignoring the state’s Code of Military Justice as well as Army and Air Force regulations.\n\nIn 2019, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and the Cap Times exposed systemic failures in the state Guard. An independent probe confirmed that Guard leaders conducted improper criminal investigations, failed to report sex crimes to police, did not track case data and used untrained investigators, among other violations.\n\nThe newspapers described how females throughout the National Guard system have seen their military careers wrecked after reporting sexual assaults.\n\nWisconsin's longtime commander, Adjutant General Donald Dunbar, was forced to step down. His replacement, Brig. Gen. Paul Knapp, said the Guard has implemented improvements in reporting and investigating sexual assault. But reform has been limited because state legislators failed to update Wisconsin's Code of Military Justice, which does not contain best practices found in the code for federal service members.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/28/election-2024-the-key-races-to-watch-in-all-50-states/75674463007/", "title": "Election 2024: The key races to watch in all 50 states", "text": "USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nElection Day will be about more than just Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nThough the presidential election is commanding the most attention, a host of down-ballot races across the country will determine control of Congress, the direction of state legislatures and major policy battles on issues such as abortion rights and marijuana.\n\nHouse races in states like Arizona, Alaska and California will determine control of the control of the 435-seat House, where Democrats seek to upend the current 220-212 GOP majority. Likewise, Democrats currently control the Senate but only by a razor-thin margin.

Milligan. While the state initially refused to redraw the map, defying a federal court order, a new map was eventually drawn. This allowed for another nearly majority Black district in Alabama and set the stage for the competitive primaries as a minority opportunity district. The winner of this race will be the first person to represent the new district. If Figures wins, Alabama will have two Democrats in the House for the first time since 2008 when it had three Democratic representatives.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Terri Sewell, Incumbent, Republican Robin Litaker\n\nWhat's at stake: Sewell is currently the only Democratic member of Congress from Alabama. If unseated, all nine of Alabama’s Congress members could be Republicans, depending on the outcome of the closely watched race in the 2nd Congressional District. It would also be the first time District 7 has ever been represented by a Republican.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Democrat Eric Hafner, Republican Nicholas Begich and independent John Howe.\n\nWhat's at stake: Holding onto Alaska’s sole House seat is key to Democrats regaining control of the House. Peltola narrowly won in 2022, defeating former Gov. Sarah Palin, becoming the first Democrat from the state elected to the House since 1972. The state’s rank choice voting system advances the top four primary candidates and places them in the general election, regardless of party. Hafner, who’s a New Jersey resident, is currently serving a 20-year sentence for making false bomb threats over the phone and threatening judges, police officers and lawyers, pleading guilty to the crimes in 2022. He’s previously ran for office outside of his home state, running in Hawaii in 2016 as a Republican and in Oregon in 2018 as a Democrat.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Increase the state's minimum wage to $15 per hour and require employers to provide earned paid sick leave for employees.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, Alaska will become the 8th state (not including Washington D.C.) to install a $15 or higher minimum wage.\n\nThe race: Ballot Measure 2\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting system that was adopted in 2020\n\nWhat's at stake: If repealed, the state will resume traditional voting. There are currently four other states, Idaho, Missouri, Nevada, and Oregon, with rank choice related measures their ballots this election.\n\n— Victor Hagan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Republican Kari Lake, U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Arizona\n\nWhat's at stake: It’s one of the marquee races across the country that could help determine which party will control the chamber. Lake appears to have gained ground on Gallego, but he has held an advantage in the polls since the outset of the race. The seat is now held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., who announced in March she would not seek a second term.\n\nThe race: Proposition 139 – Arizona Abortion Access Act\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A measure to protect abortion rights\n\nWhat's at stake: This measure would create a fundamental right to abortion under the Arizona Constitution. If passed by voters, the state will not be able to interfere before fetal viability unless it has a compelling reason and does so in the least restrictive way possible. Polling shows strong support for the measure.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican David Schweikert, Democrat Amish Shah\n\nWhat's at stake: David Schweikert, a seven-term member of Congress, is locked in a tight race with emergency room physician Amish Shah, a former state lawmaker, in Arizona’s most affluent congressional district. Schweikert is a free-market Republican; Shah is a “practical” Democrat who won a crowded six-way primary. The race is rated a toss-up.\n\nThe race: 6thCongressional District\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Republican Juan Ciscomani, Democrat Kirsten Engel\n\nWhat's at stake: In a rematch from 2022, Ciscomani faces Engel, an environmental lawyer and former state lawmaker whom he defeated by less than 2% of the vote. He is a free-market Republican and served as an aide to former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. The race is rated a toss-up. Arizona’s congressional delegation is now 6-3 Republican, so flipping both seats could flip the delegation to the Democrats.\n\n— Arizona Republic, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Arkansas Supreme Court Chief Justice\n\nWho is running: Arkansas Supreme Court Justices Karen R. Baker and Rhonda Wood are competing for the position of chief justice in a runoff election.\n\nWhat's at stake: While the outcome of this race won’t likely affect the ideological breakdown on the seven-member court, it could serve as a symbolic referendum on the two justices who have diametrically opposed views on a number of issues, notably around direct democracy. Both justices recently took strong stances on Secretary of State John Thurston’s disqualification of a ballot measure that if approved would have guaranteed a limited right to abortion in the state Constitution. Wood wrote the majority opinion in the controversial decision to uphold Thurston’s rejection of the measure, while Baker wrote a scathing dissent.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 62\n\nWho is running: In House District 62, Dexter Miller, a tech worker at the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, is challenging Republican Mark McElroy, a moderate Republican who’s served on and off in the legislature since 2012, also having run as a Democrat and an independent.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Miller ran against McElroy in 2022, losing by less than 200 votes. If 2024’s rematch is nearly as close this time around, the race could be an opportunity for the Democrats to pick up a district in eastern Arkansas, contiguous with the blue counties around West Memphis. Arkansas Democrats are mounting a big push to challenge Republican incumbents in the state legislature and in Congress, many of whom have run unopposed for years.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 56\n\nWho is running: Conway eye doctor Steve Magie, an incumbent Democrat, is defending his state House seat against conservative Republican Kim Slaughter, the owner and operator of a miniature golf course.\n\nWhat’s at stake: If the results of the 2022 elections are any indication, Magie might be one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents in the Arkansas General Assembly. He won by only 10 votes while running for his seventh term representing District 56, outside of Little Rock, in the last election. Republicans in the Arkansas House command an 82-seat supermajority in the 100-person chamber. Picking up a handful of seats could allow the state’s Democrats to gain some leverage, since spending bills require a three-quarters vote. But this will be challenging without holding onto seats like Magie’s.\n\nThe race: Arkansas House District 24\n\nWho is running: Moderate Democrat Ryan Intchauspe, an employee for a training contractor that works with the Dept. of Transportation, is running against conservative Republican Brad Hall, a rancher.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This matchup is part of a trend of Arkansas Democrats running for seats which have been solidly Republican for years and where a blue win might be a long shot. Outgoing incumbent Republican Charlene Fite ran unopposed in 2022. In 2020, before redistricting, she won in the equivalent district by close to 40 percentage points in a three-way race, and in 2018 by almost 45%. Intchauspe, a relatively conservative Democrat with some talking points that could appeal to Libertarian-leaning voters, as well as a military service record, might be a good indicator of whether districts like this are necessarily as safe for Republicans as they appear.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent and freshman Rep. John Duarte is hoping to keep hold of his seat in this rural swing district, facing his 2022 challenger, Democrat Adam Gray, a second time.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The rematch is one of five highly competitive House races in California, all of which forecasters say will help decide which party is in the majority next year. They’re also all held by Republicans, despite the state’s overwhelming Democratic majority, making them rare purple races in a state not known for dramatic election face-offs. The 13th district is among the tightest of those five, and with Gray and Duarte facing off again, it’s expected results will be razor-thin. Just two years ago, Duarte won by fewer than 600 votes, the second-slimmest margin in the nation.\n\nThe race: 27th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Garcia is defending his seat from Democrat George Whitesides, a deep-pocketed political newcomer and who once headed space-tourism company Virgin Galactic.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In this Northern Los Angeles County district, Garcia picked up the seat in 2020 in a special election and has held on to through the general election and 2022 midterm. But all those prior victories were against Democrat Christy Smith, a former state assemblywoman. With a new Democrat in the mix in Whitesides, the race could see an upset. It’s one of the five most competitive races in California this year, all of which have Republican incumbents representing areas that went to Biden in 2020. Garcia’s record could present challenges in deep-blue California. A staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, he is one of a few California Republicans who voted against certifying election results Jan. 6, 2021, and signed a 2021 amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nThe race: 41st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Rep. Ken Calvert, who has been in Congress for nearly three decades, is up against Democratic upstart Will Rollins. It’s a rematch, as former federal prosecutor Rollins attempts to grab the seat again after his 2022 defeat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whereas most of California's toss-up House races feature relative newcomers who assumed office within the last few years, Calvert is one of the state’s longest-serving representatives. Calvert won against Rollins in 2022 by less than 5 percentage points, and the Democratic challenger boasts a much larger war chest this time around. The race has attracted much attention and cash, making it the most expensive House race in the state as of early October. Polling roughly a month out from Nov. 5 has the pair at a dead heat. While Calvert has defended his seat many times over, this second match-up against Rollins is increasingly competitive, especially as 2021 redistricting looped in more liberal areas like Palm Springs.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, Democrat Trisha Calvarese and three third-party candidates: Paul Noel Fiorino, Unity; Frank Atwood, Approval Voting; and Hannah Goodman, Libertarian\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert has been a U.S. House member since 2021, but in a different district: the 3rd Congressional District that covers western Colorado. She decided to run in the 4th Congressional District last year after longtime Republican Rep. Ken Buck announced he wouldn’t be seeking a sixth term, saying many within his Republican Party have strayed from its ideals and are no longer addressing solutions. If Boebert is not elected, it will shift the representation of a portion of Colorado that has long been represented by a Republican and will represent a significant shift in the political makeup of Colorado's representation.\n\nThe race: Proposition 127\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure regarding the hunting of mountain lions, bobcats and lynx\n\nWhat's at stake: Citizen-initiated Proposition 127 seeks to make it illegal to hunt bobcats, lynx and mountain lions in Colorado, though it’s important to note that it’s already illegal to hunt lynx under state and federal law. With appropriate licenses, the hunting of mountain lions has been allowed in Colorado since 1965. Hunting of bobcats in the state has been allowed even longer. Trophy hunting mountain lions is illegal in the state. By law, mountain lion meat must be prepared for human consumption. Bobcats are considered furbearers, so you do not have to eat their meat under state hunting laws. This initiative would allow bobcats, lynx and mountain lions to be killed if they are deemed a threat to human life, livestock or property.\n\nThe race: Poudre School District R-1 Ballot Issue 4A\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A local measure on levy for schools\n\nWhy it matters: This local ballot issue represents a critical crossroads school districts face as they grapple with school funding woes and aging facilities: Do they cut services, ask for help or do both? And if they do ask for help, will they get it? Poudre School District is asking voters to approve a debt-free mill levy to support a wide range of wants and needs, including repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to school facilities.\n\n— Kelly Lyell, Miles Blumhardt, Rebecca Powell and Sarah Kyle, The Coloradoan\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent Rep. Jahana Hayes is seeking a fourth term against Republican challenger George Logan in a highly anticipated rematch. Logan, a former state senator, narrowly lost to Hayes in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 5th District is a key swing seat and the outcome could help decide which party controls the U.S. House. Both candidates are focused on economic issues, but their approaches differ. Hayes backs more federal funding for affordable housing and wage increases, while Logan advocates for reducing government spending. Other major topics include immigration reform and abortion rights, with Hayes supporting federal protections for abortion access and Logan opposing them.\n\nThe race: No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Connecticut voters will decide on the No-Excuse Absentee Voting Amendment. A \"yes\" vote would allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason. A \"no\" vote keeps the current rules, which require voters to give an excuse, like being out of town or having a disability.\n\nWhat's at stake: If passed, this amendment would make voting more accessible by expanding the use of mail-in ballots. Supporters say it’s the next step in ensuring all voters have the flexibility to cast their ballot. Opponents worry about the potential for misuse and prefer keeping in-person voting as the primary method. With many states already allowing no-excuse absentee voting, this decision could reshape how elections are conducted in Connecticut.\n\nThe race: Key state legislative races\n\nWho is running: Connecticut's state legislature expects to see several highly competitive races. In the 8th Senate District, incumbent Republican Sen. Lisa Seminara faces Democrat Paul Honig, who seeks to flip the seat held by Republicans since 1967. The 28th Senate District features Republican Sen. Tony Hwang challenged by newcomer Rob Blanchard, a Democrat, testing the suburbs' political leanings. In the 36th Senate District, Republican Sen. Ryan Fazio contends with Democrat Nick Simmons, a former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ned Lamont. The 22nd House District showcases Republican Rep. Francis Cooley battling Democrat Rebecca Martinez, who aims to reclaim her seat after a narrow loss. The 65th House District sees Democrat Rep. Michelle Cook go against Republican Joe Canino. In the 81st House District, Democrat Rep. Chris Poulos is up against Republican James Morelli. Lastly, in the 138th House District, Republican Rep. Rachel Chaleski battles Democrat Ken Gucker, who seeks to reclaim his former seat.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These races could reshape Connecticut's political landscape as demographics shift and voter turnout spikes during the presidential election. With several traditionally GOP districts in play, the outcomes will determine whether Connecticut leans further left or sees a Republican resurgence.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Current U.S. Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester faces Republican Eric Hansen and independent Dr. Mike Katz. Hansen is a Wilmington resident and businessman, while Katz is an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Both of Delaware’s seats in the U.S. Senate have been held by Democrats since 2001, so a win by Hansen or Katz, while unlikely, would be a major upset. Katz specifically would be the state’s first independent U.S. Senator. If Blunt Rochester is elected, she would be the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the third Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nThe race: U.S. House\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Sarah McBride faces Republican political newcomer John Whalen III, a retired state police officer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Delaware’s sole House seat is up for grabs without an incumbent in the race for the first time since Lisa Blunt Rochester, now running for Senate, was elected in 2016. A Republican hasn’t held the seat since 2011, and the odds appear to be against Whalen. If McBride wins the race, she will be the first transgender person elected to federal office, as well as the youngest elected official Delaware has sent to Washington since President Joe Biden’s U.S. Senate win in 1972.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer won the Democratic nomination after a tight primary race with the current lieutenant governor. He faces Delaware House Minority Leader Mike Ramone.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats have held the governor’s office in Delaware since 1993, with current Gov. John Carney – now running uncontested for mayor of Wilmington – winning his last election with nearly 60% of votes. Ramone, who has held a seat in the statehouse since 2008, is running on a platform of bipartisan leadership to challenge the state’s “single-party rule.”\n\n— The News Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second six-year term against former U.S. Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat who served just one term in Congress before being defeated by U.S. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Miami.\n\nWhat's at stake: At stake is a seat that could decide which party controls the upper chamber, with the power to approve or block appointments to the judicial branch in the next administration. Each has harshly criticized the other on perceived vulnerabilities heading to the Nov. 5 election. Scott slammed Mucarsel-Powell as an “open-border socialist” while Mucarsel-Powell called Scott an “extremist” who would put social safety net programs at risk and push for a federal abortion ban.\n\nThe race: Amendment 3\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Recreational marijuana\n\nWhat's at stake: In Florida, voters statewide will decide on Amendment 3, which seeks to legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older. As with all proposed constitutional amendments in the state, the measure requires no less than a 60% majority to pass. It would allow people to purchase, possess and use marijuana, but would not allow home growing. Its passage could align Florida with the 24 other states that have already legalized recreational marijuana, potentially affecting the state's economy and criminal justice system. Gov. Ron DeSantis and other top conservatives in the state oppose the measure, with the governor saying it could lead to prolific pot smells, among other criticisms.\n\nThe race: Amendment 4\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Abortion access\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot initiative aims to guarantee abortion access in Florida. It’s generated the most attention, especially since the Florida Supreme Court gave its OK to a six-week abortion ban in the state. Florida Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, have come out in force against the amendment. If approved, abortion access would be assured up to fetal viability, or how soon a fetus can survive outside of its mother's womb, generally considered 24 weeks. It would also allow abortions when necessary to protect a patient’s health, as determined by a health care provider. Opponents say that’s too vague and will lead to an unregulated abortion industry, but proponents dismiss those claims as “scare tactics.”\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 42\n\nWho is running: Gabriel Sanchez, a 27-year-old Democratic Socialist, and Republican Diane Jackson are both vying for their first term in the Georgia legislature.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Sanchez is the first Democratic Socialist to win a state primary in Georgia, according to the Atlanta chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the May primary, he defeated incumbent Rep. Teri Anulewicz, who has served in the House since 2017. District 42 has not been represented by a Republican since 2012 and overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, meaning Sanchez will likely be the first Democratic Socialist state lawmaker in Georgia’s history.\n\nThe race: Georgia House District 53\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Deborah Silcox, a Republican, is vying for her second term representing District 53 against Democrat Susie Greenberg.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is one of the most competitive in the state, and one of the most expensive legislative battles. Silcox flipped the district Republican in the last election, winning by fewer than 1,500 votes. Greenberg has raised nearly $432,000, according to her most recent campaign filing, more than four times Silcox’s $103,000 from this year’s campaign. Silcox previously represented House District 52 but lost to Rep. Shea Roberts, a Democrat, in 2020. Silcox notably refused to concede for over six months following the election, after a lawsuit was filed by a Sandy Springs resident alleging that voter fraud had occurred in the district. The case was eventually dismissed by the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nThe race: Georgia Senate District 48\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Shawn Still, a Republican, is defending his seat from Democratic challenger Ashwin Ramaswami\n\nWhat’s at stake: Still was one of 19 people indicted in Georgia as part of former President Trump’s fake elector scheme, having served as a secretary who signed and filed false documents in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. His opponent, Ramaswami, has been campaigning on his experience in election cybersecurity and other progressive issues, and has raised more than five times as much as Still, according to recent campaign filings. If elected, Ramaswami would be the first Indian American and first Gen Z lawmaker in the Georgia Senate.\n\n— Maya Homan, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Hawaii Island mayor\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Mayor Mitch Roth is seeking a second term against challenger Kimo Alameda. Roth, a former Hawaii County prosecutor, has over 40 years of public service experience, while Alameda, a psychologist and former VP at Hawai‘i Island Community Health Center, has deep ties to the island and has been compared to the late Mayor Billy Kenoi.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Key issues include affordable housing, homelessness, permit backlogs, and infrastructure upgrades. The race is closely watched due to the split endorsements from labor unions, with Roth supported by private-sector unions and Alameda backed by public-sector unions. In the August primary, Roth led with 38% of the vote, but Alameda’s 28% and the 34% secured by four other candidates make this a competitive race, as those voters could swing the outcome in November.\n\nThe race: Office of Hawaiian Affairs Board of Trustees\n\nWho is running: Six candidates are running for three seats on the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) Board. For the at-large trustee seat, incumbent Keli‘i Akina is being challenged by Lei Ahu Isa. In the Kauai-Niihau seat race, incumbent Dan Ahuna faces Laura Lindsey. For the Molokai-Lanai seat, incumbent Luana Alapa is running against Kunani Nihipali. Additionally, Kaiali‘i Kai” Kahele has already secured the at-large trustee seat for Hawaii County in the primary election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The OHA Board directs significant resources to Native Hawaiian communities through scholarships, loans, and grants. These trustees play a vital role in shaping programs that promote education, business development, and community support for Native Hawaiians across the state.\n\nMore: Hawaii House speaker loses reelection bid, deceased lawmaker wins seat: 5 takeaways from Saturday's primaries\n\nThe race: Hawaii legislative races\n\nWhat’s at stake: Hawaii's Legislature is set for a major shakeup, with at least 11 new members joining the upcoming session. With all 51 House seats and 13 of 25 Senate seats up for election, a wave of retirements, primary defeats, and shifting political dynamics are driving significant turnover.\n\nKey races: One of the most notable upsets occurred in House District 25, where progressive Kim Coco Iwamoto ousted House Speaker Scott Saiki, leaving a leadership vacancy that will be addressed after the election. In other key House races, Ikaika Hussey unseated longtime Rep. May Mizuno in District 29, while Shirley Ann Templo defeated Rep. Sonny Ganaden in District 30, signaling growing ideological diversity within Hawaii’s Democratic Party. The race in District 50, where Mike Lee will face Republican Timothy Connelly, could also see a competitive challenge from the GOP. In the Senate, Democrat Cedric Gates is battling Republican Samantha Decorte in Senate District 22, a district that has been trending more conservative, offering the GOP a rare opportunity in a predominantly Democratic state.\n\nWhat's at stake: These contests reflect broader trends of political shifts in Hawaii, with an incoming class that could tilt the legislature in new directions on housing, education, and economic policy. Whether the state moves further left or sees a surge in conservative momentum will depend on the outcomes of these races, marking a pivotal moment for the future of Hawaii’s politics.\n\nThe race: Constitutional amendments\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Voters in Hawaii will consider two significant state constitutional amendments. The first proposal aims to remove the legislature's authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples, contingent upon a reversal of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2014 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The second proposal seeks to streamline the judicial appointment process by aligning the selection of district court judges with that of Supreme Court justices and higher court judges, enhancing consistency and efficiency in the judiciary.\n\nWhat’s at stake: These amendments mark a notable shift from Hawaii's recent trend of maintaining legislative control over such matters. They represent the first constitutional amendments on the ballot since 2018, following a long period of inaction where the legislature rejected hundreds of proposals, including 68 in the current biennium. Given Hawaii's stringent requirements for passing amendments — requiring a two-thirds vote in both chambers or consecutive majority votes — the outcome could have lasting implications for the state’s legal framework and judicial system.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMore: Hawaii voters to decide on marriage law authority and judicial appointment process\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Idaho voters will weigh in on an initiative to institute a top-four primary system and ranked-choice voting. Under a top-four primary system, all the primary candidates appear together on the same primary ballot, regardless of their party, and the top four vote-getters from that pool move on to the general election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Idaho’s Republican, Libertarian and Constitution Party primaries are currently closed, meaning that only registered members can vote in them. The Democratic Primary is open, meaning anyone can vote regardless of their affiliation. According to Boise State Public Radio, almost a third of all registered voters in Idaho today are unregistered, which means they can’t vote in most primaries.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 15\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Rick Just, a Democrat, is defending his seat against Republican former state Rep. Codi Galloway in a rematch of a race from 2022. District 15 is a swing district in the western part of Boise.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Spending on this race has been the highest among any state legislature race this year, Idaho Education News reported. Close to a quarter million in spending between the two candidates works out to almost $6 per resident in the district. Just won the seat in 2022 by less than 2 percentage points, a little more than 300 votes which, if that’s any indication of how this race will go, makes him perhaps one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the legislature this cycle.\n\nThe race: Idaho Senate District 6\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Dan Foreman is fending off a challenge from Democrat Julia Parker. In 2022, Foreman ousted incumbent Democrat David Nelson in a tight race decided by little over 400 votes.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This might be one of the best opportunities in Idaho for Democrats to flip a seat in the state Senate, which is dominated by Republican lawmakers by a four-to-one margin. Foreman had run against Nelson twice, in 2018 and 2020, before finally winning in 2022, showing how competitive the district is.\n\n— George Russell, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Eric Sorenson faces off with challenger Joe McGraw, a retired Rockford judge running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race, which covers majority of northern/northwestern and parts of central Illinois has been hotly contested the last few races, with the Democrats winning in tight races. The race is seen as a potential seat where Republicans can make a gain. Of the 17 seats in the congressional delegation, 14 are held by Democrats.\n\nThe race: 13th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Nikki Budzinski faces off with Joshua Loyd, a political outsider running on the Republican ticket.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This race is another one which was seen as a potential seat that could flip from blue to red in the Springfield area. In August, Democrats across the state poured “seven figure investments” into two races, this being one of them. Loyd is a West Point graduate and fervent backer of the Second Amendment.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: This is an open seat, since outgoing Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb is term-limited. Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun is giving up his Senate seat to run against Democrat Jennifer McCormick, a former state Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Libertarian Donald Rainwater, who previously garnered 11% of the vote in the 2020 gubernatorial race, a record for Indiana Libertarians.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Braun's to lose, in a solidly red state where Democrats haven't won a statewide office since 2012 or the governor's office since 2000. But since recent polling has shown Braun underperforming compared to other Republicans in Indiana, the race has suddenly seemed more competitive in the eyes of national observers and each party's governor associations, which have chipped in hundreds of thousands of dollars to each candidate in the last few weeks. A Democratic win is still unlikely, but there are signs that a solid performance by McCormick could mark the beginning of a pendulum shift for the balance of power in Indiana in elections to come.\n\nThe race: Indiana Attorney General\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita is seeking a second four-year term against Democratic challenger Destiny Wells, an Indiana Army National Guard lieutenant colonel who has quickly risen to prominence in the state Democratic Party. Rokita has been a mainstay in Indiana Republican politics for the last two decades, serving in both the U.S. House and as Indiana Secretary of State. Wells has not held elected office but ran for Indiana Secretary of State back in 2022.\n\nWhat’s at stake: There’s been a lot of attention on the race in the context of Indiana’s near-total abortion ban. Rokita is an ardent anti-abortion candidate who faced a national firestorm over his comments on Fox News about an Indiana doctor, Caitlin Bernard, who gave an abortion to a 10-year-old rape victim back in 2022. Wells has campaigned with Bernard and has pitched the race as a way for Hoosiers to weigh in on abortion rights since the state lacks a ballot referendum process.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan is seeking a third term in the U.S. House. He is being challenged by Republican Lake County Council member Randy Niemeyer, who has been endorsed by high-profile national Republicans and tapped as a “Young Gun” race to watch by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Libertarian Dakotah Miskus, a 25-year-old from LaPorte County, is also running in this election.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The district is one of only two Democratic congressional districts in all of Indiana and the 2024 race is the second election cycle that Republicans have eyed the seat as a potential flip to grow their party’s majority in the House. In the 2022 midterms, Mrvan won reelection by 6 points over his Republican challenger in a race closely watched by national political analysts. Democrats have held the 1st District for nearly 100 years, but the area is made up of working-class Rust Belt communities where former President Donald Trump typically performs well.\n\n— The Indianapolis Star, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks is in a rematch with Democrat Christina Bohannan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 1st Congressional District could be the sleeper swing district in a state that has turned decidedly red in recent elections. Active voter registrations favor Republicans, and Miller-Meeks defeated Bohannan in 2022 by about 7 percentage points. But in this rematch, national Democrats have funneled money into the race to capitalize on what they see as Miller-Meeks’ weakness with independents and even some Republicans. The limited publicly available polling of the race suggests Bohannan might have the edge.\n\nThe race: 3rd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Zach Nunn is being challenged by Democrat Lanon Baccam, both of whom are veterans.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Iowa’s 3rd District was anticipated to be its most contested after Nunn squeaked into office with a victory of less than 1 percentage point in 2022. In a state where Republicans hold all four congressional posts, it’s perhaps Democrats’ best chance of flipping a seat. It’s got a narrower Republican voter registration advantage than other districts in the state, and it’s home to some of Iowa’s largest urban metro areas, which tend to favor Democrats. But Nunn has avoided major missteps, and Republicans remain confident in their chances.\n\n— The Des Moines Register, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: House District 52\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jesse Borjon, R-Topeka, faces challenger Jacquie Whitney Lightcap, D-Topeka.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the legislature. National Democrats early on identified Borjon’s seat as a key pickup opportunity, but Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s PAC did not endorse in the race.\n\nThe race: House District 102\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Jason Probst, D-Hutchinson, faces challenger Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchinson.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The biggest issue in Kansas elections is whether Republicans can retain or Democrats can break the GOP supermajorities in the Legislature. Republicans believe they can grow their supermajorities and identified Probst’s seat as a key pickup opportunity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 10\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Mike Thompson, R-Shawnee, faces challenger Andrew Mall, D-Shawnee.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, is widely viewed as the most important electoral battleground, and this race could be a barometer for others in the Kansas City suburbs. Thompson is an affable former television weatherman, but has established himself as one of the most conservative lawmakers with high-profile questioning of climate science and election integrity.\n\nThe race: Senate District 11\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Sen. Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, faces challenger Karen Thurlow, D-Stilwell.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is another high-profile race in Johnson County. Warren was a significant figure behind Value Them Both, an anti-abortion constitutional amendment that voters decisively rejected in 2022. The race could show whether reproductive rights continue to be a winning issue for Democrats.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 2\n\nWho is running: Kentucky voters will weigh in on a constitutional amendment that, if passed, would let state lawmakers direct spending toward non-public education, including through charter school and voucher programs.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While proponents of the change say this would allow Kentucky students to have wider access to a variety of schools that may better suit their educational needs, critics allege that the amendment would leave a devastating financial impact on the state's public school system.\n\n— The Courier-Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 4th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t face a serious challenge in what is considered a safe GOP seat, but his race and reaction after will be closely watched because of his close ties to former President Trump.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Johnson’ previous defense of Trump both during his impeachment and following the 2020 election that Trump lost has raised questions as to whether the leader of the House will certify the 2024 presidential election if Trump loses again.\n\nThe race: 6th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Cleo Fields, who served in Congress in the 1990s, and former Republican state Sen. Elbert Guillory are familiar faces on the ballot, but they are joined by newcomer Quentin Anthony Anderson, a Democrat and executive chairman of a social justice nonprofit, who is also running a district-wide campaign.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana’s new 6th District boundaries created a court-ordered second majority-Black district that favors Democrats and caused incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Garret Graves to bow out of race. A victory here by Democrats would cut into the Republicans’ slim majority in the House.\n\nThe race: Amendment No. 1 to the Louisiana Constitution\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The proposed amendment would expand the dedication to the Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund to add federal money the state receives from offshore wind, solar and other alternative or renewable energy sources generated in federal Gulf waters off the state’s coast.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Louisiana has lost 2,000 square miles of land since the 1930s, about the size of Delaware. The state’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Fund provides money for projects to restore and preserve the Louisiana coast.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is being challenged by Republican Austin Theriault\n\nWhat’s at stake: Golden is running for his third term in Congress, but as a Democrat in a Trump-won district, he is particularly vulnerable to a Republican challenge. Not only are the party demographics stacked against him, but he also recently changed his position on assault weapons after Maine’s deadliest ever shooting in Lewiston last October. A district with a high proportion of gun owners, this may come back to hurt him in the election. While Golden is a blue dog, conservative Democrat, Theriault, a Republican state representative and former NASCAR driver, has tried to tie him to national Democrats as well as criticized him on the gun issue. The race will be an important one for determining which party will take control of the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe race: Maine state legislature\n\nWho is running: Every representative and senator in the Maine state legislature\n\nWhat’s at stake: Maine currently has a Democratic trifecta in state politics, with Democrats controlling the governorship, the state House, and the state Senate. The governor has two more years left of her term, but every seat in the legislature is up for reelection. Maine also has term limits on its legislators — they are elected to two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms — making the races more volatile and open than other states. While Democrats are the favorites to retain control, these factors along a national election with Trump on the ballot is causing Republicans to feel hopeful of capturing one of those chambers this year, more likely the House.\n\nThe race: Flag question\n\nWho is running: Measure to change Maine’s state flag\n\nWhat’s at stake: This measure would replace the current official Maine state flag, which is blue with the state’s coat of arms, with the former state flag, which features a green pine tree and the North Star on a light tan background. The former state flag, commonly known as the Pine Tree Flag, was originally adopted in 1901 before being replaced by the current flag in 1909. It’s become a slightly controversial ballot measure, with some conservatives see changing the flag as a sign of “wokeness,” as the current flag features two white men next to the coat of arms. However, the Pine Tree Flag is already an iconic image, appearing on souvenirs, clothing and many flag poles.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, are seeking the U.S. Senate seat held by Sen. Ben Cardin, who is not seeking reelection after serving three terms.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The eyes of the nation are on Maryland as the Senate race may help might decide the balance of power in the chamber. Though Larry Hogan has said he won't vote for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race, the shadow of presidential race holds major sway over this contest. Alsobrooks leads by double digits in many polls, but this one should still come down to the wire.\n\nThe race: Legislatively referred abortion amendment\n\nWhat's on the ballot: In 2023, the Maryland General Assembly passed legislation to refer an amendment to the state’s Constitution on abortion to voters. The state’s voters approved a related measure in 1992 with a majority voting to make the procedure legal. If the measure is passed, any future changes would require a future General Assembly to put the issue again before voters. If the measure fails, the procedure would still be allowed under current state law.\n\nWhat's at stake: Though this ballot measure in bright blue Maryland is almost certain to pass, by how wide a margin could have a big impact on Maryland's U.S. Senate race. Ads supporting Democrat Angela Alsobrooks have continuously singled out Republican Larry Hogan's personal opposition to abortion, though Hogan's campaign has stressed that he has publicly opposed to a federal abortion ban and as far back as when he first ran for governor, Hogan promised not to change Maryland’s laws protecting abortion access.\n\n— Keith Demko, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is being challenged by Republican John Deaton\n\nWhat's at stake: Warren has gained a national profile in her two terms as senator, compiling one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate. She's been willing to break with party leadership on key issues such as immigration — voting earlier this year against a bipartisan Senate immigration bill and criticizing President Joe Biden's executive order on tightening the border. Deaton moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island only months before the primaries. The cryptocurrency lawyer has highlighted his rough childhood in the Detroit area while presenting a moderate stance on issues such as abortion — at times infuriating conservative Republicans in the process.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 2, Eliminating the MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nWhat's on the ballot: For more than 20 years, students have been required to pass the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System tests in math, science and technology, and English in order to graduate from a public high school in Massachusetts. If it is passed, Ballot Question 2 would eliminate the requirement.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The question has divided some of the most prominent Democrats in the state. Supporters include Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Reps. Ayanna Pressley, James McGovern, Lori Trahan and William Keating. Opponents include Gov. Maura Healey, Lt. Gov. Kimberly Driscoll and Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell. Supporters of the ballot question, including the state's teachers unions, say the test is a one-size-fits-all exam that does not properly evaluate student performance and achievement. Opponents, who include business-aligned groups as well as the state superintendents association, say removing the requirement would lead to a lowering of standards across the board.\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 5, Minimum Wage for Tipped Workers\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Current law allows employers of service workers such as servers, bartenders and nail technicians to pay them as little as $6.25 an hour, as long as tips raise the workers’ pay to at least the regular minimum wage of $15. If they do not, employers must make up the difference. Question 5 would gradually eliminate the difference between tipped workers' minimum wage and the standard minimum wage.\n\nWhat's at stake: If the question passes, by Jan. 1, 2029, the statewide minimum wage would apply to all workers. The measure would also allow employers to pool tips to distribute to all their workers, as long as everyone on the payroll is paid the state minimum wage. Supporters of the ballot question say that tips should be a reward for good service, and not a subsidy for employers who pay less than minimum wage. The ballot question has been fiercely opposed by the restaurant industry, which warns passage will lead to higher menu prices for consumers, and will force restaurants to cut staff or even close.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who served as a CIA officer in Iraq and as a Pentagon official, faces Republican former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, who served seven two-year terms before leaving in 2015 and rose the rank of House Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This is one of a handful of open seats in the U.S. Senate, the result of Democratic U.S. Debbie Stabenow’s decision last year not to run for a fifth six-year term, so it could play into which party ends up with majority control of the chamber. Democrats (and the independents they caucus with) currently have a one-seat majority. No Republican has won a U.S. Senate election in Michigan since Spencer Abraham in the Republican wave of 1994. But with Michigan clearly in play as a presidential battleground, Republicans are hoping Rogers can ride what they are hoping is former President Donald Trump’s strength in a state he won in 2016 to a victory.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican former state Sen. Tom Barrett, a former Army helicopter pilot, faces former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., a member of a well-known Michigan political family who was a key aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Two years ago, Barrett lost to Democratic U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin in one of the most expensive House races in the nation in a redrawn district centered in and around Lansing, the state capitol. Slotkin is running for U.S. Senate this year and Barrett is back figuring that Hertel may be an easier opponent than his former rival who was known for raising scads of money and doing well in tossup districts like this one. Hertel, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on Barrett’s previous stance as an all-out abortion opponent, even though he says he will vote for anything that crosses protections put into the state constitution in 2022. With control of the U.S. House possibly in play, millions in outside spending have already poured into this race again.\n\nThe race: 8th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet faces Paul Junge, a former assistant prosecutor, TV anchor and official with the Homeland Security Department during the Trump administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Like the race in the 7th District, this is one which, if U.S. House races are close nationally, could determine which party holds majority control of the chamber. Right now, Republicans hold an eight-seat majority in the U.S. House. Even though this district, anchored by Flint, Bay City and Saginaw in mid-Michigan, has been trending more Republican in recent years, it was considered a likely Democratic hold until U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee last year announced he would leave at the end of this term, his sixth. KIldee’s late uncle, Rep. Dale Kildee, sat in the seat before him for 18 two-year terms.\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Republican U.S. Rep. John James, in his first term in Congress, faces a rematch with Carl Marlinga, a Democratic former Macomb County judge and prosecutor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This district, which includes much of southern Macomb County and parts of neighboring Oakland County, was widely seen as trending Republican when it was redrawn ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. As such, Democratic groups largely stayed away, figuring James, a businessman and former Army helicopter pilot who had run two strong but ultimately unsuccessful U.S. Senate races, would easily win. It was anything but easy in the end: Marlinga, who has been in and around Macomb County politics for decades and presents himself as a pragmatist and a moderate Democrat, came within about one-half of 1% of beating James, despite being outspent by a 6-to-1 margin. James is running on his record, saying he has worked to bring projects back to the district; Marlinga, now with some Democratic support behind him, is trying to portray James’ conservativism as out of step with the district.\n\n— Detroit Free Press, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Minnesota House of Representatives District 14B\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Dan Wolgamott, DFL-St. Cloud, is looking to keep his seat in the Minnesota legislature, which he first won in 2018. He is being challenged by Republican Sue Ek, who previously ran for office in 2005.\n\nWhy it matters: The Minnesota statehouse is completely controlled by the DFL, which is Minnesota's Democratic party. Republicans are looking to flip the House to end the DFL trifecta, and St. Cloud is historically a political battleground, with some candidates in District 14A winning by fewer than 200 votes. Wolgamott came under fire last fall after he got a DWI. Meanwhile, his Republican opponent is labeled as extreme with her vocal opposition against same-sex marriage, contraceptives and abortion access. LGBTQ+ issues remain a hot topic in the state. The DFL trifecta passed a law banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth last legislative session. In addition, the state passed gender-affirming care legislation for minors.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar is seeking reelection. She is challenged by Republican Royce White, Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey and Libertarian Rebecca Whiting.\n\nWhat's at stake: Minnesota's U.S. Senate race is sparking a conversation about morals. White, a former NBA player, has been criticized for allegedly using past campaign funds at strip clubs. At a St. Cloud appearance, he told voters he is transphobic, alleged the \"woke left\" are trying to villainize Christians and said he's further right than former President Donald Trump. This in part caused former Republican, current Independent-Alliance Party candidate Joyce Lacey to run, saying conservatives needed another option. Despite the conversations, incumbent Klobuchar is polling significantly behind her 24-point margin of victory in 2018. Current 2024 polls show the Democratic senator having an 8- to 11-point lead.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic candidate Ty Pinkins, a Delta native, is seeking to unseat Republican incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Pontotoc native who has been in office since 2008. If Pinkins' wins, he would be the first Democrat to occupy the office since John C. Stennis, who retired in 1989. While Pinkins' name became more common due to the 2023 Mississippi Secretary of State race in which Pinkins lost, he is polling at a mere 1% against Wicker.\n\nWhat's at stake: Pinkins' challenge to Wicker, if successful, would contribute to the Democratic defense of their majority in the U.S. Senate. A Pinkins victory would also take Mississippi's congressional ratio from five Republicans and one Democrat to four Republicans and two Democrats. While a Democratic win in this race is a long shot, how far Pinkins closes the 99-point gap with Wicker by Nov. 5 will be used as a starting line for future Democrats running for Mississippi's congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is on the ballot: Democratic incumbent U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson is running against Republican challenger Ron Eller, who has never won a political race. Thompson, who is favored to win, has been in office in Washington, D.C., since 1993 and has become something of an institution among national and state Democrats. Notably, Thompson has served as the chair of the Jan. 6 Investigative Committee, trying to unfold the chain of events surrounding a Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhat's at stake: Thompson is the only Democrat from Mississippi in the U.S. Congress right now and has been so since 2011. If he were to lose to Eller, the state's largest Black and Democratic district would go red and Mississippi would not be represented by any Democrat in Washington, D.C., if Republican U.S. Reps. Trent Kelly and Mike Ezell, and Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker don't lose to their respective races.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court Central District, Place 1\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Jim Kitchens faces a challenge from four opponents for one of the state's supreme court judge seats. Kitchens was appointed to his seat in 2009, and it is uncommon for a judge to win a seat as a challenger to incumbents in Mississippi, according to state election records.\n\nWhat's at stake: Of Kitchen's opponents, one, state Sen. Jenifer Branning, R-Philadelphia, has been endorsed by the Mississippi Republican Party. The race, as well as the Mississippi Supreme Court, is supposed to be nonpartisan. With an endorsement from the state GOP, a Branning victory could mean a more conservative lean on the court. Kitchens is listed as a nonpartisan candidate, as well as Ceola James and Byron Carter, who are also running in that race.\n\nThe race: Mississippi Supreme Court District 2, Place 2\n\nWho is on the ballot: Incumbent Dawn Beam has served on the court since she was appointed by former Republican Gov. Phil Bryant in 2016. She faces just one challenger, David Sullivan, a South Mississippi attorney.\n\nWhat's at stake: Like in other races this year, the Mississippi GOP has endorsed Beam to beat Sullivan, who himself has so far been outraising Beam for the court seat. Judge positions in Mississippi and judicial races are known for being nonpartisan. Considering the endorsement for Beam, a Sullivan victory could signify a political shift. It would also represent a break from how judges usually win a Supreme Court seat, which is to be appointed and then reelected as an incumbent.\n\n— The Clarion-Ledger, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Amendment 3, abortion rights\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A ballot initiative amending the state Constitution to establish a “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives” without government interference. While establishing a constitutional right to abortion, the amendment would still allow government regulation of the practice as well as restrictions on abortions that take place after fetal viability.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri was the first state to outlaw abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, enacting a trigger law passed in 2019. The heavily-funded effort to get the abortion rights initiative on the ballot has been opposed by Republican legislators and elected officials at every step, with the state Supreme Court weighing in at the 11th hour to keep it on the ballot.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Sen. Josh Hawley is seeking a second term after flipping Missouri’s second Senate seat in 2018, when he defeated Democrat Claire McCaskill. Though polls still show Hawley favored to win, Democratic challenger Lucas Kunce, a former Marine, has closed the gap while significantly outperforming Hawley in fundraising. In addition, independent candidate Jared Young, who formed his own Better Party when establishing his candidacy, is running with the endorsement of former Republican Sen. Jack Danforth.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have established a significant advantage in Missouri over the past two decades and now control every statewide elected office, as well as both seats in the U.S. Senate. How competitive the race turns out to be is likely to highlight Hawley’s vulnerability as well as the effectiveness of Democrats’ strategy — Kunce is the second Missouri Democrat with a military background to run competitively for Senate. Young’s performance, meanwhile, could point to desire among moderates and conservatives for a return to a more balanced approach.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe faces Democrat Crystal Quade, who is termed out in the state House of Representatives, where she has served as minority floor leader.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Missouri last elected a Democratic governor in 2012, when moderate Jay Nixon won a second term. In the years since, Republicans have taken every statewide office and hold supermajorities in the legislature. Kehoe, endorsed by outgoing Gov. Mike Parson, is heavily favored to win, but the race against Quade — a well-liked leader who has helped flip several seats for Democrats in conservative southwest Missouri — will show how much ground progressives need to make up to be competitive again. With abortion rights on the ballot and Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, conditions are as favorable as they’re likely to get for Quade to close the gap.\n\n— Amos Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate:\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is fighting for his fourth term against Republican Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Sheehy currently leads by 7 points, according to RealClearPolitics polling average.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Tester is one of the last remaining Democrats in a heavily Republican state. His loss could almost guarantee a GOP Senate majority. Despite trailing in the polls, Democrats are heavily investing in Tester’s campaign, with outside groups spending tens of millions of dollars. Native American voter turnout, which played a crucial role in Tester’s previous victories, could be a deciding factor. Sheehy's comments about Native Americans and questions about his past have provided Democrats with attack lines. The outcome will likely come down to turnout and the effectiveness of both candidates’ ground games.\n\nMore: These congressional races could decide which party leads the US Senate and House\n\nThe race: Montana's Second Congressional District\n\nWho's running: Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke is seeking reelection, facing Democrat Monica Tranel in a rematch from 2022. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and interior secretary under Donald Trump, won that race by 4 points. Tranel, a former Olympic rower and energy lawyer, is giving it another shot after her narrow loss.\n\nWhat's at stake: This race could play a key role in deciding control of the House, where Republicans hold a slim majority. Zinke has moved further to the right, aligning closely with Trump on issues like the border and \"cancel culture.\" Tranel, once a Republican herself, has positioned her campaign as a fight for accountability and transparency in government. The district includes both Democratic hubs like Missoula and Republican strongholds, making it a competitive battleground.\n\nThe race: Montana Supreme Court justices\n\nWho is running: Voters in Montana will elect two new justices to the state Supreme Court in 2024. The race for chief justice features Jerry Lynch, a former federal magistrate, and Cory Swanson, an attorney with military experience. For the associate justice position, Katherine M. Bidegaray, a district court judge and ranch owner, is running against Dan Wilson, a former justice of the peace.\n\nWhat's at stake: The upcoming election is crucial as it could shift the ideological balance of the Montana Supreme Court. Currently, the court has three liberal-leaning justices, two conservative-leaning justices, and two swing voters. If both conservative candidates win, the court may lean conservative for the first time in years. However, if at least one liberal candidate secures a seat, the court will maintain its existing balance. Partisan groups are already making endorsements: Democratic-aligned organizations support Lynch and Bidegaray, while Swanson and Wilson receive backing from prominent conservatives, including Gov. Greg Gianforte.\n\nThe race: Montana abortion access\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Montana voters will decide whether to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution. This measure seeks to protect a 1999 Montana Supreme Court ruling, which asserts that the right to privacy includes the right to a pre-viability abortion by a provider of the patient’s choice.\n\nWhat's at stake: This initiative comes as Republican lawmakers have tried to overturn the Supreme Court ruling since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Montana Legislature passed a law in 2023 stating that the right to privacy does not safeguard abortion rights. Supporters collected over 81,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, while opponents attempted to block it. With abortion access becoming a hot button issue nationwide, the outcome in Montana could set a precedent for similar measures in other states.\n\n— Jeremy Yurow, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Don Bacon is seeking a fifth term in a race against Democratic state Sen. Tony Vargas of Omaha.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race between Bacon and Vargas is seen as one of the most competitive House races in the country this year and is being eyed by national Democrats as an opportunity to flip a Republican seat in its attempt to regain a majority in the House. Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District is deeply moderate and has gone for Bacon since 2016, despite flipping for President Joe Biden in 2020. Vargas ran against Bacon in 2022 and lost by nearly three points. Vargas has been polling just points ahead of Bacon in recent weeks and the Cook Political Report identified the race as a toss up in late September.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third six-year term against former union leader, steamfitter and independent candidate Dan Osborn.\n\nWhat’s at stake: A few months ago, the race appeared to clearly favor Fischer, who has broad financial and political backing in the deeply Republican state. That was the case until this summer, when polls conducted by Osborn’s campaign showed him and Fischer in a dead heat. Outside groups are pouring advertising money into both campaigns and the Cook Political Report recently changed the race’s leaning from solid-R to likely-R.\n\nThe race: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Dueling abortion-related ballot initiatives: one aiming to expand abortion access in the state and the other looking to limit it.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While multiple states will see abortion on the ballot this election, Nebraska is the first since the overturning of Roe v. Wade to put competing measures before voters. One measure backed by Protect Our Rights, a coalition of reproductive rights groups in the state, aims to enshrine the right to abortion when it is “needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” as well extend abortion access up to fetal viability. However, it does not list a specific number of weeks. The other sponsored by Protect Women and Children would enshrine Nebraska’s current 12-week ban in the state Constitution with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman. It would allow the state legislature to pass narrower or complete bans in the future.\n\nThe race: Ballot measure on the legalization of medical cannabis\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Two measures aimed at legalizing medical marijuana.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Nebraska is one of the last states where the use of medical cannabis is still illegal. To combat Nebraska’s single-issue law, the group is sponsoring two separate measures. One would decriminalize the use of medical marijuana and create protections for patients and caregivers. The other would legalize possessing, manufacturing, distributing, delivering and dispensing cannabis for medical purposes and create a state commission to regulate the drug.\n\n— Maya Hoff, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho’s running: Incumbent Democrat Jacky Rosen and Republican Sam Brown\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats’ majority in the U.S. Senate is hanging by a thread, and Nevada’s seat up for election this year is considered competitive. Rosen, who prides herself on being one of Congress’ most bipartisan members, has an edge in the polls against Brown, an Army veteran who’s fully in former President Donald Trump’s camp. If Trump wins Nevada — the presidential race is within a single percentage point in the polls — his coattails could help Brown. In 2022, Catherine Cortez Masto — a well-liked incumbent Democrat with support from numerous prominent Republicans — won her U.S. Senate race by only about 8,000 votes. The Senate race may be a squeaker again.\n\nThe race: Ranked-choice voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A “yes” vote on the initiative would create primaries where the top five candidates regardless of party would move on to the general election.\n\nWhat's at stake: This ballot race could upend Nevada politics for years to come by allowing nonpartisans — who outnumber Republicans and Democrats in the state — to participate in partisan primaries for state and federal races. Currently only Republicans and Democrats can vote in their own party’s primary races. Supporters think the initiative will create less extreme candidates because candidates will need to appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and they say voters will have more choice because often only the two candidates with the most money get on the November ballot. Opponents say it’ll create confusion and could diminish the chances of independent candidates who would now have to compete with major party candidates in primaries. Only three states currently have ranked-choice voting: Alaska, Maine and Hawaii.\n\nThe race: Washoe County Question 1 — library funding\n\nWhat’s the ballot: Continue a dedicated funding stream for the Washoe County Library System or give the county commission more oversight of library programs.\n\nWhat's at stake: As part of the culture wars in a swing county of a swing state, Reno-area libraries have been the scene of heated protests and increased security. Of the 22 book challenges last year in Nevada libraries — most of those over LGBTQ+ content — all were in Washoe County. This summer, the library system ended Drag Queen Story Hours at its libraries, citing “violence against staffers … perpetrated by a small group of very vocal, very aggressive protesters.” A Drag Queen Story Hour protester — Bruce Parks, chair of the Washoe County Republican Party — co-authored the official ballot argument against continuing the library’s dedicated funding stream. The dedicated funding stream represents about a quarter of the library system's budget. If the initiative fails, the library would have to appeal to elected officials to make up that shortfall.\n\n— Reno Gazette Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Republican former U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte faces Democrat former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in an open seat race to succeed Gov. Chris Sununu, who has been the state’s popular Republican governor for eight years.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Democrats are hoping to take back the governor's office in New Hampshire for the first time since 2016. The most competitive governor’s race in the country, Ayotte benefits from name recognition, while Craig is bolstered by Vice President Kamala Harris’ popularity in the state. Ayotte’s poor relationship with Trump as well as his lack of popularity in the state means she will likely have to run far ahead of the former president to win the seat. She has also faced attacks on her past votes on abortion policies, while Craig has faced attacks over homelessness in Manchester. While the state has trended more Democratic in federal elections in recent years, the state government has been controlled by Republicans. Ayotte currently holds a narrow lead over Craig in the polls.\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas is seeking a fourth two-year term to represent New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District against Republican former New Hampshire Executive Councilor Russell Prescott.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District has historically been a swing district, the moderate Pappas has dominated in recent years, proving his ability to win over voters from both parties. It is currently rated likely Democratic by the Cook Political Report. But Prescott is a less pro-Trump Republican opponent than Pappas has faced in the past, and his supporters hope this will help him unseat the popular incumbent and allow Republicans to take one of the two congressional seats.\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Maggie Goodlander faces Republican Lily Tang Williams in this open race seat to replace retiring Rep. Annie Kuster.\n\nWhat’s at stake: This seat leans likely Democratic, but features two unique candidates. A political newcomer, Goodlander is a former senior White House aide in President Joe Biden’s administration as well as the wife of National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. She won a hard-fought primary against Kuster’s endorsed successor, Colin Van Ostern, proving herself to be a savvy campaigner and fundraiser. She is favored over Lily Tang Williams, whose American dream-esque story of escaping communist China allowed her to emerge victorious from a field of 13 Republican candidates.\n\nThe race: New Hampshire Executive Council District 3\n\nWho is running: Republican incumbent Executive Councilor is seeking a third term to represent the Seacoast of New Hampshire in the five-body Executive Council. She is being challenged by Democrat former state Sen. Jon Morgan.\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Hampshire’s little known Executive Council has been dominated by a Republican majority of 4-1 thanks to heavy gerrymandering and has faced controversy for the Republican’s repeated rejection of funding for Planned Parenthood and other reproductive clinics in the state that provide basic, low-cost reproductive health care. Stevens is favored to hold onto her seat in the Republican-leaning district, but Morgan’s record of winning in similar partisan districts means he could be a legitimate threat.\n\n— Margie Cullen, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Rep. Andy Kim, a Democrat, faces Republican Curtis Bashaw.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The contest will determine the future of the seat long held by former Sen. Bob Menendez, who was convicted on federal bribery charges earlier this year and resigned from the Senate. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy, his former chief of staff, to fill the seat until a successor is elected. Bashaw, a Cape May hotelier and businessman who is gay, has framed his campaign around moderate Republican positions familiar to New Jersey voters. Bashaw is pro-choice and has made his focus on government accountability and lowering spending. Kim, who has served in Congress since 2018 and was a diplomat in the administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, prevailed in a competitive primary in which he held off a challenge from New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy. Kim is focused on ensuring America’s global economic competitivesness and stabilizing affordability.\n\nThe race: 7th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Faces Democrat Sue Altman\n\nWhat’s at stake: New Jersey’s sprawling 7th Congressional District is a microcosm of the Garden State itself and stretches across 95 municipalities in six diverse counties. The district includes urban, suburban and rural communities. Kean, first elected in 2022 after a career in the New Jersey Senate, is a moderate Republican who is focused on affordability and lowering government spending. Kean has endorsed former President Donald Trump. Altman, the former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, is running on a platform that espouses women's and reproductive rights, safeguarding democratic institutions and asserting America’s leadership on the world stage. The race is tight, but registered Republicans in the district outnumber Democrats by more than 14,000.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New Jersey\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: 2nd Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Gabe Vasquez faces Republican Yvette Herrell\n\nWhat’s at stake: As a result of redistricting in 2020, New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District stretches from its traditional boundaries encompassing the conservative southeastern part of the state to include portions of blue-leaning central and northern New Mexico. The seat has bounced back and forth between the parties since Republican Steve Pearce left it to seek election to the U.S. Senate, with Yvette Herrell gaining the seat in 2020 from Democrat Xotchitl Torres Small, who she challenged in 2018. Herrell then lost it in 2020 to Gabe Vasquez. Herrells’ loyalty to Trump is reflected in her stand on abortion and enthusiasm for domestic drilling of crude oil and natural gas resources, positions in direct opposition to the governor and majority Democratic state legislature.\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democrat Martin Heinrich faces Republican Nella Domenici\n\nWhat’s at stake: Martin Heinrich has been at the forefront of developing New Mexico’s green energy transition, committing federal funds to establish wind and solar farms. Nella Domenici, daughter of Pete Domenici, a Republican who held New Mexico’s Senate seat for six terms, is following in her father’s conservative footsteps. Domenici says New Mexico should trade on its position in the Permian Basin, one of the largest oil producing regions in the U.S.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, in office since 2009, is seeking another six-year term against Mike Sapraicone, a Long Island resident who owns a private security company.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Gillibrand is widely favored to win, New York state has seen some shifts in places from blue to red. Her margin of victory and where her numbers might slip from the 2018 election will be telling about New York’s political trends.\n\nThe race: Proposition 1\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: New York has one statewide ballot question for voters to decide this fall: whether to add abortion and LGBTQ rights to the state Constitution. New York's would ban discrimination based on \"reproductive healthcare\" and a host of other reasons unrelated to abortion, such as sexual orientation, national origin and age.\n\nWhat’s at stake: At a time when such rights are under attack in much of the country, this ballot measure’s fate will be instructive.\n\nThe race: 17th Congressional district\n\nWho’s running: First-term Republican Rep. Mike Lawler faces former Rep. Mondaire Jones.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 17th Congressional District, one of the nation's most hotly contested swing districts — a seat Democrats lost in 2022 and need to recover to regain a House majority. Lawler eked out a narrow upset win in the suburbs north of New York City two years ago. If he retains his seat, that would reflect a reddening of these areas where residents have been concerned about immigration and crime. Jones is a former House member who saw his previous seat disappear in redistricting earlier this decade.\n\nThe race: 19th Congressional District\n\nWho’s running: Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro is seeking a second term in a rematch against Democratic challenger Josh Riley, former Dutchess County executive and a former state Assembly member.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In early autumn, this was the most expensive House race in the country, reflecting the importance of the seat in terms of which party will control Congress in 2025 and 2026.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK - New York\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Mark Robinson, the current Republican lieutenant governor, has caused shock waves in North Carolina and national politics for his incendiary comments, most recently after a CNN article alleged he made racist and sexual posts on a pornography message board, which he denies. Robinson, 56, is running against Josh Stein, the 58-year-old lawyer and current attorney general.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Abortion and education have become key aspects of this race. Although he’s flipped on his abortion stance, Robinson in the recent past has supported tighter restrictions. Stein is an outspoken reproductive rights supporter and is endorsed by Planned Parenthood Votes! South Atlantic. These candidates are also on opposite ends when it comes to funding education. Stein is fighting for fully funding public schools, and Robinson is supporting taxpayer funded private school vouchers. Robinson also used his time in office to investigate possible indoctrination of schools.\n\nThe race: Superintendent of Public Instruction\n\nWho is running: Republican Michele Morrow is a former missionary and homeschool curriculum developer and nurse who is running against Democrat Maurice (Mo) Green, a previous superintendent of Guilford County Schools and general counsel and deputy superintendent for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Morrow, 53, has become a controversial candidate for her presence at the Jan. 6 riot and incendiary remarks posted on social media, recently posting on X that the “+” in LGBTQ+ stands for “Pedophilia.” Morrow supports private school vouchers and has said she wants an audit of federal money in North Carolina schools, claiming their money often comes with strings attached, WRAL reports. Green’s campaign has called Morrow a “dangerous” choice for students, and he supports fully funding public schools and rejects using taxpayer money for private school vouchers. Green, 56, also hopes to partner more with outside community organizations to support children's education.\n\nThe race: North Carolina Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is looking to keep her seat on the state’s high court after Gov. Roy Cooper appointed Riggs, a Democrat, to fill former Justice Mike Morgan’s slot on the bench in 2023, following his retirement. She is running against Jefferson Griffin, a Republican on the state court of appeals.\n\nWhat's at stake: Republicans already hold a 5-2 majority on the state’s highest court, which in recent years has upheld gerrymandered maps that could give Republicans even greater control in the U.S. House. But if Riggs, a Democrat wins, her party will have the opportunity to regain that majority in 2028. Griffin is close with N.C. Supreme Court Justice Paul Newby. (Newby won his seat in 2020 by just 401 votes against Cheri Beasley.) So far this election, Griffin has raised $1.3 million, to Riggs’ $1.1 million.\n\nThe race: Buncombe County Board of Commissioners chair\n\nWho is running: Former Buncombe County Sheriff Van Duncan is running for chair of the county board of commissioners as an unaffiliated candidate. His opponent, Commissioner Amanda Edwards, a Democrat, faces a steep fundraising gap.\n\nWhat's at stake: Duncan, a former Democrat, is trying to toe the line between parties. But he’s received sizable campaign contributions from notable area Republicans like former Congressman Charles Taylor. Buncombe County is home to Asheville and was hard hit be Tropical Storm Helene. Whoever wins will likely play a major role in the county's Helene recovery efforts.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Initiated Statutory Measure No. 5\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: The measure creates a new chapter of the North Dakota Century Code related to the legalization of cannabis and related regulation, according to North Dakota’s Secretary of State website.\n\nWhat's at stake: If approved, it would allow for the production, processing, and sale of cannabis and the possession and use of various forms of cannabis by individuals who are 21 years of age and older. It would also allow the state to regulate the industry and preserve employer rights regarding the use of cannabis products by employees, among its provisions. The measure includes revenues of $10,227,600, expenses of $8,324,275, and “an undetermined amount of additional costs associated with behavioral health and social impacts for the 2025-2027 biennium,” the website states.\n\nThe race: Governor\n\nWho is running: Michael (Coach) Coachman, an independent; Kelly Armstrong; a Republican; Merrill Piepkorn; a Democrat.\n\nWhat's at stake: North Dakota caught a bit of attention this election season, when current Gov. Doug Burgum ended up on the short-list as a vice-presidential candidate for former President Donald Trump. Last year, Burgum briefly sought the Republican presidential nomination and in January, he announced he would not seek a third term as governor, leaving the race wide open.\n\n— Shelly Conlon, Argus Leader, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown and Republican businessman Bernie Moreno\n\nWhat’s at stake: Brown is one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this year − second only to Montana Sen. Jon Tester − and the outcome in Ohio could determine which party controls a closely divided U.S. Senate come January. Former President Donald Trump also won Ohio by 8 points in 2016 and 2020. Polls show Trump easily winning Ohio again. This is the first time Brown has been on the ballot the same day as Trump, who has endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe race: State Issue 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: A group called Citizens Not Politicians crafted a new way to draw districts and put the constitutional amendment on the ballot as Issue 1.\n\nWhat's at stake: The proposal would replace the current politician-run commission with a 15-member citizen commission of five independents and five members each from the top two political parties, currently the Republicans and Democrats. Members couldn't be elected officials, lobbyists or political consultants. During the last redistricting cycle, lawmakers and elected officials repeatedly drew legislative maps deemed unconstitutional by the state Supreme Court. Currently, Ohio Republicans dominate the redistricting process and hold supermajorities in the state House and Senate.\n\nThe race: 3 seats on the Ohio Supreme Court\n\nWho is running: Cleveland Democrat Melody Stewart and Cincinnati Republican Joe Deters, both incumbent justices, are facing off. Gov. Mike DeWine appointed Deters to an unexpired term but Deters decided to challenge Stewart for a full term. Cleveland Democrat Michael Donnelly, an incumbent, is being challenged by Cincinnati Republican Megan Shanahan, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court judge making her first statewide run. Cleveland Democrat Lisa Forbes, an 8th District Appellate Court judge, and Columbus Republican Dan Hawkins, a Franklin County Common Pleas Court judge, are both running for the seat left open by Deters' decision to challenge Stewart.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Republicans have held majority on the court for nearly 40 years. The Democrats are trying to reelect two incumbent justices and win an open seat. The GOP wants to expand its majority by sweeping all three races, which would give Republicans six of seven seats. Who controls the court has a major impact on issues including abortion and redistricting.\n\n— The Columbus Dispatch, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Oklahoma Corporation Commission\n\nWho is running: Republican Brian Bingman faces Democrat Harold Spradling and Libertarian Chad Williams in a race to replace outgoing Commissioner Bob Anthony. Bingman was the secretary of state until he stepped down last year to campaign for corporation commission.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The influential Corporation Commission regulates public utilities, oil, gas and other energy sources, commercial transportation and petroleum storage tanks. The three-person commission has been the subject of recent turmoil after witnesses reported seeing Commissioner Todd Hiett grope a man while Hiett was extremely intoxicated at a conference in June. Hiett has refused to step down, and Anthony launched an investigation into his colleague’s behavior. Anthony’s replacement will now help determine how the commission moves forward.\n\nThe race: State Question 834\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: A measure put on the ballot by Republican lawmakers asks voters to tweak part of the state Constitution that defines who can vote as a “qualified elector.”\n\nWhat’s at stake: While only a few words would change, supporters say the move is needed to make clear only people who are legal citizens of the U.S. can vote in Oklahoma elections. Critics say the proposed change is targeting issues that don’t exist — routine audits of election results and voter rolls show the state’s election system is accurate and secure.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District, representing Oklahoma City and parts of central Oklahoma\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice faces a challenge from Democrat Madison Horn, a cybersecurity expert.\n\nWhat’s at stake: While Oklahoma is a solidly red state, the metro area district Bice and Horn are vying to represent is turning purple. If voters send Horn to Washington, D.C., she would be the state’s lone Democratic representative in Congress. Her odds remain long, however. While Democrats are gaining ground in and around Oklahoma City, they’re still outnumbered by Republican voters. Republican incumbents are on track to retain Oklahoma’s four other seats in the U.S. House.\n\n— The Oklahoman, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Measure 118\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: Measure 118, known as the Oregon Rebate, would raise the minimum corporate tax rate.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Oregonians will decide whether to raise the minimum tax rate by 3% for corporations with Oregon sales above $25 million a year and distribute the proceeds to every Oregonian, beginning in 2025. Passage would make Oregon the first state with a universal basic income program. State analysts estimate the measure would increase corporate tax revenue by $1.3 billion during Oregon’s two-year budget cycle. Proponents say the measure would decrease the state poverty rate by “rebating” some $1,600 a year to every resident. Opponents say the measure would result in increased costs and loss of businesses.\n\nThe race: 5th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Democrat Janelle Bynum is challenging incumbent Rep. Lori Chavez DeRemer, R-Oregon.\n\nWhat’s at stake: In 2022, Chavez-DeRemer was the first Republican woman elected to represent Oregon in the U.S. House. Bynum twice beat Chavez-DeRemer for the Oregon legislature and seeks to flip the seat. Polls have designated the race as a “toss-up.”\n\nThe race: Oregon attorney general\n\nWho is running: Republican Will Lathrop and Democrat Dan Rayfield\n\nWhat’s at stake: The race is Oregon’s first attorney general election since the state’s 2020 drug decriminalization measure was passed and later dismantled. Lathrop previously served as a deputy district attorney in Yamhill and Marion counties, while Rayfield has been a member of Oregon’s House of Representatives since 2015 and served as speaker of the House from February 2022 until the end of the 2024 legislative session. Democrat Ellen Rosenblum, who has been attorney general since 2012, announced her retirement in 2023. With more than $2 million in combined spending, the race is the most expensive of Oregon’s three statewide elections. Oregon’s last Republican attorney general left office in 1993.\n\nThe races: Mayor of Portland and Portland city councilors\n\nWho is running: There are 19 people running for mayor, including three city commissioners, a trucking company leader, a stripper/author, and a nonprofit director. Ninety-eight candidates are running for 12 Portland City Council seats.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The 2024 election will be the first using ranked-choice voting for the mayoral, auditor and city council races in Portland, Oregon's largest city. The new Portland mayor also will have a new job description. A voter-approved change in 2022 means the mayor will not have a vote on the Portland City Council unless there is a tie and will mostly serve in an administrative role.\n\n— USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey is vying for his fourth term against Republican Dave McCormick, a former hedge fund CEO and high-ranking Treasury Department official during former President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nWhat’s at stake: The Pennsylvania Senate seat is a must-win for Democrats seeking to retain control of the upper chamber, which they hold by a razor-thin margin. Casey, a fixture in Pennsylvania politics, has breezed through his past reelection battles. But McCormick does have the advantage of voter discontent with President Joe Biden and has worked hard to implicate Casey in the Democratic administration's perceived shortcomings on immigration and the economy. While the incumbent is favored, the race has narrowed, and a handful of polls show the two candidates locked in a dead heat.\n\n— Bethany Rodgers, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 10th Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Six-term incumbent Republican Scott Perry is facing perhaps his strongest opponent so far, Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson, a popular former TV news anchor.\n\nWhat’s at stake: Control of the U.S. House could be on the ballot in this race. Perry, a former chair of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, has not faced strong opposition during his tenure in Congress in a conservative district. But Stelson, a Republican turned Democrat, has hammered Perry for his positions on reproductive rights and has cast the election as a choice between anti-democratic views and her commitment to democracy. Perry was on the front lines of President Donald Trump’s fight to overturn the 2020 election, an effort that led the U.S. Justice Department to launch an investigation and seize Perry’s cell phone via a search warrant. That investigation has not resulted in any charges, and Perry has denied any wrongdoing. Political observers predict a close race in a district that became more competitive after the most recent redistricting. Polls show the race in a dead heat.\n\n— Mike Argento, York Daily Record, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: 1st Congressional District\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is seeking a fifth term against Army veteran and Apache helicopter pilot Ashley Ehasz, who lost against Fitzpatrick in 2022 but now has the backing of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as a “top-tier candidate” to flip a longtime red district in the Philadelphia suburbs.\n\nWhat's at stake: The 1st District is one of 33 congressional races the DCCC has highlighted in its Red to Blue campaign to maintain or bolster control of the House. The southeastern Pennsylvania district has been under Republican leadership since 2011, with Fitzpatrick cementing a reputation as the most bipartisan member of congress. Ehasz’s campaign has pushed back on that neutral image, saying the incumbent’s bipartisanship won’t extend to reproductive rights and threats to democracy.\n\n— Chris Ullery, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nThe race: Pennsylvania Senate, 49th District\n\nWho is running: Two-term Republican incumbent Sen. Dan Laughlin faces a challenge from the former chair of the Erie County Democratic Party Jim Wertz, a first-time candidate.\n\nWhat's at stake: Democrats see district, which covers nearly all of Erie County, as being among the seats they can flip to take over the state Senate. Laughlin and Wertz, who used to trade emails about politics, also are engaged in a civil lawsuit. Laughlin claims the weekly Erie Reader and Wertz defamed him by publishing an opinion piece by Wertz — who was a contributing editor and writer for the publication before his state Senate bid — that accused Laughlin and U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of seeking a pardon over the 2020 election. Laughlin had signed an amicus brief that specifically stated it was not taking the side of either the plaintiff or the defendant in the case Texas v. Pennsylvania, which was a hail-Mary attempt to overturn the results of the presidential election.\n\n— Matthew Rink, Pennsylvania state investigative team, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: U.S. Senate\n\nWho is running: Incumbent Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse is seeking a fourth term against Republican state legislator Patricia Morgan, who lists her occupation as \"financial advisor.\"\n\nWhat’s at stake: Whitehouse, 68, a former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island attorney general, has been in the Senate since 2007, after he ousted Republican Lincoln Chafee. He is known for warning about the perils of climate change and \"dark money\" in campaign finances. Whitehouse was named Senate Budget Committee chair last year and turned much of its focus toward climate issues. More recently, he’s been one of the louder voices in Washington on term limits for the U.S. Supreme Court. Morgan is a former state Republican chair, House minority leader – and unsuccessful 2018 primary candidate for governor – who has served in the legislature off and on for 12 years. She has attacked Whitehouse for supporting President Joe Biden on immigration and federal spending, among other issues. In announcing her candidacy, she took aim at inflation, the economy and \"massive and wasteful federal spending.\"\n\nThe race: Ballot Question 1\n\nWhat's on the ballot: Question 1 will determine whether there will be a constitutional convention\n\nWhat’s at stake: If voters approve Question 1 on Nov. 5 there will be an election to choose 75 delegates who will meet at a time and place to be determined to recommend amendments to the state Constitution that would be put up for approval at another statewide election. The last time voters called for a convention was 1984, and past conventions have taken on many shapes and sizes, from the 1973 convening that lasted a month to the 1964 affair that lasted four years. The last one cost taxpayers $891,000, or about $2.5 million in today's money.\n\n— Providence Journal, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nBack to the top\n\nThe race: Proposed constitutional amendment on voting\n\nWhat’s on the ballot: South Carolina voters will see a proposed amendment to section 4 of Article II of the state Constitution reading “Must Section 4, Article II of the Constitution of this State, relating to voter qualifications, be amended so as to provide that only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law?”\n\nWhat’s at stake: The proposed change would alter one word of the state Constitution to have it read “only a citizen of the United States and of this State of the age of eighteen and upwards who is properly registered is entitled to vote as provided by law.” Although an investigation fou", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2014/11/06/veterans-women-service-war/18548275/", "title": "Female veterans share their stories of service", "text": "Robin D’Angelo\n\n\"There was something in me that wanted to serve.\"\n\n• Carol Ann Fausone\n\n\"I knew it would teach me character.\"\n\n• Lauren Medina\n\n\"I needed a better way to support my kids. I saw the opportunity for college.\"\n\n• Nicole Bundas\n\nThree female veterans - three stories.\n\nLauren Medina, 28, of Livonia decided to join the United States Air Force at age 19.\n\n\"My grandpa was in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and my cousin was in the Navy. I really looked up to both of them, and I knew it was something important to do,\" she said.\n\nAfter six weeks of basic training in San Antonio, she was enrolled in the Air Force's medical technician program in Florida.\n\n\"It was very challenging in many ways, but my biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to live away from my family. At the beginning it was physically and mentally demanding, but I think it made me a stronger woman,\" she said.\n\n\"I know I'm capable of doing things I never thought I would be. I never thought I'd be crawling in the mud. I don't think anybody thought I could do what I did. I chose to be there, so I knew I had to be strong and complete it.\"\n\nMedina said when she was struggling with the distance and loneliness, she often thought about her grandpa \"because he was so strong\", as well as her cousin and her fellow soldiers on foreign soil.\n\n\"A lot of people I knew were getting deployed and many of them had kids, but there I was in Napa Valley. That made me realize I had nothing in the world to be down about. You have to put it in perspective,\" she said.\n\nAt completion, she was transferred to the David Grant Hospital on the Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., where she cared for wounded men and women returning from overseas.\n\n\"We were the stop between Ramstein Air Base (Germany) and their final base, and meeting those men and women was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had,\" Medina said.\n\n\"Many still had major injuries, and they would stay in our unit for wound care. They were just glad to be back on American soil, and they wanted to talk about home. They like talking about going home, rather than where they were coming from. Most soldiers want to talk about anything but that, really.\"\n\nShe finished her service in 2010, and then was faced with the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life - the biggest being finding employment.\n\n\"When you get out, sometimes what you do doesn't transfer over to the civilian side, so I couldn't perform the same things I did in the military. My duties were similar to a licensed vocational nurse, but on the outside I was a basically a licensed EMT,\" she said.\n\n\"It can be very difficult to figure things out when you get back, and people who were in for longer than I was have even bigger issues. You have all this military training, but then you get out and you don't have anything, and I'll tell you, these are the best people you'll ever work with. You can't slack off in the military - you can't take a day off, you can't be late.\"\n\nMedina, now a student at Wayne State University, will graduate this winter with a major in apparel design. She continues to stay in touch with most of her former colleagues, many of whom are still in the service.\n\n\"It's cool that you develop such close friendships with the people you serve with. I have never regretted my choice to join,\" she said.\n\n\"It really was one of the best experiences and best choices I ever made in my life, and I will always be proud of it. I work harder, and I know the value of working and not giving up.\"\n\n***\n\nNicole Bundas of Redford enlisted in the Army National Guard in 2007 as a way to carve out a better future for herself and her two young sons.\n\n\"I was going through a divorce at the time, and it hit me that I needed a better way to support my kids,\" she said.\n\n\"I was working as a preschool teacher, and I saw the money for college, plus there was an enlistment bonus. I saw it as an opportunity.\"\n\nShe attended nine weeks of basic training in South Carolina, and from there went to Fort Meade, Maryland for 12 weeks of advanced training in public affairs, journalism and photography.\n\n\"It was hard and different and exciting, all at the same time,\" she said.\n\n\"I was older than most of others who I enlisted with, so that was a little harder, as well as leaving my two boys at home. But that only made me work all the harder, because I had something to work for. I knew I had to complete it and do a good job.\"\n\nBundas knew she would be required to attend training once a month, but when the call came in that she was to be deployed before she had even left her training in Maryland, she was stunned.\n\n\"That was very abnormal. Usually you come home and wait for your unit to take its turn. It was October, and they told me I'd get to come home for a couple of months, and then I was leaving for Iraq. With two little boys at home, that was definitely not what I wanted to hear,\" she recalled.\n\n\"I was sobbing hysterically on the phone with my sergeant, and he kept saying, 'I understand.' I always knew deployment was always on the table, but I never expected it to happen so quickly.\"\n\nFor two months, she spent as much time as possible with her children, while at the same time attending a flurry of extra training in order to prepare for Iraq.\n\n\"I wasn't just sitting at home doing nothing - I had to go through all of the pre-mobilization stuff. I spent weeks at Camp Grayling in northern Michigan getting to know my new unit,\" she said.\n\nOnce overseas, Bundas became an embed specialist in charge of working with the civilian media.\n\n\"My job was to get all of their information, get them through security, get them in-country and hook them up with a specialty unit that they could stay for multiple days. I then had to track them to see what kind of news articles they were putting out, and make sure that they actually were putting them out,\" she said.\n\n\"I arranged all of their travel while they were there, and made sure they were following the rules. We held weekly press conferences, and I also did a little of my own stuff as a journalist. I have to say it really gave me an appreciation for what the civilian media do. I signed up to serve, but these people were willing to risk their lives to tell our stories.\"\n\nShe said she was glad to be a part of the good stories that were told - the stories that gave the families of the soldiers a different perspective than the negative aspects that are most often portrayed.\n\n\"People worry. They see all the negative things, but rarely to do they get to see this or that amazing thing that their son, daughter, husband or wife is accomplishing over there,\" she said.\n\n\"I wanted them to have that peace of mind, to see that their family members were doing great things, and they were making a difference.\"\n\nBundas said she saw many instances of heroism, but added, \"There were other times that were absolutely horrifying. You're in a foreign country in a time of war.\"\n\nShe recalled an element of disbelief at times, thinking of the transition from her former life to the life of a soldier.\n\n\"One year before I was doing circle time with toddlers and changing wet Pull-Ups, and now I'm carrying a weapon and worrying about if I will make it to tomorrow,\" she said.\n\n\"Thankfully I was in a safer area. I had a cell phone, I could Skype with my kids, and I could call them. There were moments when it got scary, and I questioned whether I had made the right decision,\" she said.\n\nThe most difficult part of deployment by far was the separation from her children - what she describes as the universal struggle of military moms.\n\n\"As a mother, you always want to be the one to take care of them when they're sick or be there when the good things happen, especially when they are so little,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the toughest thing for me, when they would call and say they didn't feel well or that this great thing happened that I missed.\"\n\nReturning home was not without its struggles, either. Units that have been together every moment of the past year suddenly find themselves separated and scattered across the state, left to return to civilian life without the benefit of that tightly-knit support system they had come to rely on so heavily in Iraq.\n\n\"They have shared everything that's been going on in your life for the past 365 days, and been with you every moment. Then, all of a sudden, they're gone,\" she said, choking up.\n\n\"You're excited to be home and be with your loved ones, but the people in your unit have also become your family. I'm on the east side, but my unit is stationed in the Battle Creek area. We went from 24 hours a day to one weekend a month.\"\n\nBundas said because suicide is increasingly prevalent among returning servicemen and women, members of her unit made an effort to keep in close contact after coming home.\n\n\"You come back and you're going through things, reintegrating with your parents or your spouse. We made sure we called and talked to each other. It's been five years and we still do that. Most of us our contracts have expired, but we don't want to lose one of our brothers or sisters.\"\n\nAlthough finding employment can also be a struggle for veterans, Bundas was hired at the VA Hospital in Ann Arbor several months after her return.\n\n\"I was very lucky in that respect, but at the same time it was a hard transition from being told 24 hours a day what to wear, what to do and how to breathe to now making all of these decisions...not just for me, but for two other little people who were depending on me,\" she said.\n\n\"I still see the struggle our veterans go through every day. The biggest thing is that we keep supporting them after the homecoming. I have watched so many people get that initial support, but after a while it dies down. We can't forget. It's bad enough that we are losing them when they deploy, we don't want to lose them when they come home.\"\n\nBundas said she found support by joining a female veterans group at the Ann Arbor VA, which provides guidance through everything from breast cancer to post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"I do have bad days, but there is so much support out there and I have taken the opportunity to get it,\" she said.\n\n\"They know what's going on for female veterans, and I tell my friends that they need to be a part of it. I don't care if you had best deployment ever - it's important that you're there and talking.\"\n\nSince her return, Bundas is still employed at the VA, has purchased her own home and now has a four-year-old girl.\n\n\"I've accomplished so much, and I never would've been able to do these things without my time in the service. If you asked my older son, he would tell you he's thankful mommy joined the Army. It was hard on him because he was old enough to know what was happening, but he has also seen the benefits,\" she said.\n\n\"Serving was the hardest thing I've ever done, but the things I gained from it outweigh the hardship and I am appreciative of all the good things that happened, and that everyone in my unit made it home. That was the best news. Did I personally go out and save anyone's life? No...but I made sure that the stories of people who did were told.\"\n\n***\n\nCarol Ann Fausone of Canton, took her oath with the Air Force in 1977. She has since devoted her life to the service of her country - not only rising through the ranks to become the first female Brigadier General in the history of the Michigan National Guard, but making it her mission to help veterans secure the education, benefits and health care they are due.\n\nFausone said her grandfather, a World War I veteran, inspired her to enlist with his stories and his great love of his country.\n\n\"There was something in me that wanted to serve my country, and I knew I wanted to be a nurse. It kind of fit, because nursing can be done in the air and on the ground, and that's how I got there,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a lot different today in that women are more recognized. In the state of Michigan, I believe we have about 45,000 female veterans, which was unheard of back then. Women always had certain roles, but now they can have any role, really. We have female fighter pilots, female security police. It's an issue of what's in your heart and your leadership abilities, and that's something the men go through too.\"\n\nFausone said a few of the most problematic issues facing both female and male veterans today are accessibility to healthcare and affordable housing.\n\n\"I am passionate about these issues. Our veterans should not be treated in cookie-cutter fashion. We need to listen to their issues and help them; not just the veterans, but their families. Our families have sacrificed while we served,\" she said.\n\n\"We are trying to help our women who are homeless, but the number keeps going up, and when children are involved that is very difficult. Sometimes our veterans have trouble reaching out; especially women, because they tend to take care of everyone else before they take care of themselves.\"\n\nIn addition to her military service, Fausone was as the director of nursing at St. Mary Mercy Hospital in Livonia, and oversaw the ER at St. John's in Detroit and Macomb County.\n\nAs for what she credits with her rise through the ranks, Fausone stresses the importance of leadership and problem-solving.\n\n\"Some of the ceilings have been broken for women today - there's a three-star and a four-star (general) out there. You can aspire, but it still starts with you and your roles and leadership,\" she said.\n\nThroughout her career, she was singled out for responsibilities that she says were \"out of the norm\" - the vice commander of the medical squadron at Selfridge, and later the medical commander.\n\n\"That wasn't heard of,\" she said.\n\n\"With traditional roles, it was always a physician who was the commander, and predominantly they were male. I broke that ceiling.\"\n\nShe was later one of several females around the country to be selected as medical commander at a national level, and was responsible for 45 units at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. From 2001-2005 she served as the Assistant for Mobilization and Reserve Affairs, where she developed and implemented health care programs, policy, and operations for Reserve Affairs. From 2003-2011, she was the Assistant Adjutant General of Veterans Affairs for the Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.\n\nFausone's passion for veterans' rights continued after her retirement from the service, when she promptly created The Veterans Advocate, LLC in order to guide veterans and their families in securing their benefits. Her husband Jim, an attorney, provides legal aid to veterans and their families at Legal Help for Veterans, PLLC.\n\n\"Whether I am helping our veterans or my constituents, I have an entire toolbox of resources after all these years. My dream would be to be queen for a day and make changes to these rules, to change why it takes so long to get an answer for a grant. The VA is working on it, but there are still issues out there,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm a fix-it person. I love challenges and issues - that's been my whole life. As an ER nurse, we had to make decisions quickly and take care of people, and whether it's in my business, the military or on the campaign trail, when people come up to me with an issue, they know I care. I know if I look behind me, people are going to follow.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2024/03/22/womens-march-madness-ncaa-tournament-first-round-scores-highlights/73020452007/", "title": "Women's March Madness scores: Full NCAA bracket, first-round ...", "text": "The women's NCAA Tournament got underway Friday with 16 games.

It’s OK, you won’t hurt our feelings,” LSU coach Kim Mulkey said.\n\nIt’s impossible to sugarcoat this one. LSU had more turnovers, a season-high 24, than it did field goals (21). And most of the miscues were self-inflicted. The Tigers were outscored in the paint 24-20. Angel Reese, the Most Outstanding Player of last year’s title game, was held to a season-low 10 points and one field goal, though she did have 19 rebounds.\n\nAbout the only good thing you could say is that LSU did win. Which, Mulkey noted, is the sole objective at this time of year. — Nancy Armour\n\nNebraska outlasts Texas A&M in wild finish to cap off Friday\n\nCORVALLIS, Ore.— Why is it always the last games of the day that go the craziest?\n\nAfter trailing most the night and missing numerous opportunities to take the lead, 11th-seeded Texas A&M finally evened the score against Nebraska, 56-56, on two free throws — with 1:38 to play.\n\nThe final 98 seconds were as frenzied as you can imagine.\n\nFirst Nebraska responded with a rushed shot, which air balled. But the Aggies gave it right back when they were called for an offensive foul, and it remained 56-56 with 1:01 to play. Then, Nebraska’s Alexis Markowski got a seal inside and scored the go-ahead layup.\n\nTAMU wasn’t done. After Endyia Rogers missed a 3, Aicha Coulibaly flew in and tipped in the miss, drawing a foul on the play. She went to the line with 17.7 to play and made it, giving the Aggies a 59-58 lead. At the other end, TAMU was whistled for an off-ball foul, putting Nebraska on the line for two. The Huskers nailed both to take a 60-59 lead with 14.6 to play.\n\nThen the Aggies called a time out and advanced the ball before driving for a layup. But Janiah Barker lost her footing on the way to the basket, and the ball.

Audi Crooks and Iowa State\n\nIt’s going to be a battle of the bigs when Stanford and Iowa State play Sunday.\n\nThe second-seeded Cardinal easily dispatched 15th-seeded Norfolk State on Friday night, 79-50. Norfolk State was able to stay close through the first quarter, but couldn’t contain Cameron Brink and Kiki Iriafen over the last three quarters.\n\nStanford’s bigs combined for 34 points, 24 rebounds and six assists. That’s still fewer than the 40 that Audi Crooks dropped on Maryland as the Cyclones stormed back from a 20-point deficit. The 40-point game was just shy of Tonya Burns’ single-game record of 42 for Iowa State.\n\nCrooks, a freshman, also had 12 rebounds.\n\nStanford was led by Elena Bosgana, who had 18 points. Brink and Iriafen had 17 each, which Brink adding 15 rebounds for her 20th double-double of the season and Iriafen pulling down nine boards. Hannah Jump had 13 points to go with her four assists.\n\nDiamond Johnson led Norfolk State with 19 points and also had seven rebounds. Kierra Wheeler was the Spartans’ only other player in double figures, adding 17 points and eight boards. — Nancy Armour\n\nNebraska enters fourth quarter up on Texas A&M\n\nJust when you think this game might get interesting … TAMU has forced turnovers and had plenty of opportunities, but the Aggies’ inability to capitalize on those opportunities is why they’re trailing Nebraska 48-38 heading into the fourth quarter. TAMU is shooting 14-of-45 from the field. Yikes.Meanwhile, Nebraska hit four 3s in the third to create some separation. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nDiamond Johnson hits wild shot for Norfolk State vs. Stanford\n\nNorfolk State might not get the win, but the Spartans will always have Diamond Johnson’s circus shot.\n\nLate in the third quarter, Johnson got Cameron Brink to bite on a fake, then drove the baseline. But she was off-balance and was practically falling out of bounds as she put up a floater. No matter. The shot with 1:47 left in the third, was good and even Brink could only smile.\n\nIt was, let’s be honest, the lone highlight in the quarter for 15th-seeded Norfolk State, which trails 58-37 going into the fourth quarter. The Spartans are shooting 36%, led by Johnson’s 15 points and 12 from Kierra Wheeler. But it’s no match for second-seeded Stanford, which has four players in double figures, including a double-double by Cameron Brink (13 points, 11 rebounds) and a near one by Kiki Iriafen (17 points, eight rebounds.) — Nancy Armour\n\nNo. 6 Nebraska leads Texas A&M at halftime\n\nA long drought for A&M midway through the second quarter — the Aggies hit just 1-of-11 field goals in a stretch — helped Nebraska build a 27-20 lead at halftime. Each team’s leading scorer has eight points: Janiah Barker for the Aggies, and Logan Nissley for the Huskers. The winner of this advances to play Oregon State on its home floor Sunday.\n\nAlso how’s this for weird: Texas A&M has hit four 3s, and Nebraska has just two.\n\nCameron Brinks leading Stanford vs. Norfolk State\n\nCameron Brink is doing Cameron Brink things\n\nWith not even two minutes gone in the third quarter, the All-American has a bucket and a board, giving her a double-double for the game with 10 points and 10 rebounds. That’s helped Stanford open a 19-point lead, 40-21, on Norfolk State, its largest of the game.\n\nIt is Brink's 20th double-double of the season, tying her for sixth-most in the NCAA this season\n\nStanford pulling away from Norfolk State at the half\n\nKiki Iriafen had 10 points in the second quarter as Stanford pulled away from Norfolk State to take a 32-19 lead at halftime.\n\nThe Spartans had been a little too close to comfort for the second-seeded Cardinal, trailing by just three at the end of the first quarter after Diamond Johnson’s driving layup. But Iriafen was unstoppable in the second quarter, going four of six from the floor, including a layup just before the halftime buzzer. She also had three rebounds.\n\nNorfolk State is still hustling, but it can’t compete when it’s shooting 29% while Stanford is hitting almost 45% of its shots. — Nancy Armour\n\nNebraska vs. Texas A&M: Both teams have a former Duck\n\nCORVALLIS, Ore. — Something interesting that sixth-seeded Nebraska and 11th-seeded Texas A&M have in common: Both have a former Oregon player on their roster.\n\nEndyia Rogers, a 5-foot-7 guard originally from Dallas, is playing for the Aggies this year as a grad student after spending two season at Oregon (and before that, two seasons at USC). A three-time All-Pac-12 selection, Rogers averages 12.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.9 assists for A&M.\n\nAt Nebraska, senior guard Jaz Shelley, an Australia native, transferred to Lincoln after two years with Oregon. Shelley averages 13.7 points and 5.6 assists for the Huskers. There’s an argument to be made that one of these former Ducks is the key to her team advancing to the second round.\n\nAt the end of the first, Nebraska leads 14-12. Nebraska, which typically shoots more than 25 3s a game — 21st most in Division I — is 0-for-4 from long-distance so far.\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nNo. 2 Stanford comes out hot after tough first quarter\n\nWell, Norfolk State seems to now have Stanford's full attention. The Cardinal have opened the second quarter with a 9-0 run that prompted the Spartans to call a timeout after just over 2 ½ minutes had been played. Stanford now leads, 24-12, with Kiki Iriafen now up to nine points and Cameron Brink and Hannah Jump adding six each. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nNebraska vs. Texas A&M redux!\n\nHere's a quick look at the upcoming last game of the day: Nebraska vs. Texas A&M.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it should. Earlier tonight in the NCAA men's tournament, Nebraska also met Texas A&M, with the Aggies winning 98-83 after scoring 58 points in the first half. Adding further intrigue to these matchups, on March 13, Texas A&M announced that it had hired Trev Alberts away from Nebraska to become its new athletics director. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nStanford vs. Norfolk State: No. 2 Cardinal not cruising\n\nn a bit of an early surprise, 15th-seeded Norfolk State is giving Stanford a tough time through one quarter at Stanford. The Cardinal lead, 15-12, But they committed six turnovers during the quarter, letting the Spartans stay close despite being out-shot and out-rebounded during the quarter. While Stanford's leading scorer this season, forward Kiki Iriafen scored five points in the quarter, she also had three turnovers. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nOregon State vs. Eastern Washington final: Beavers win, 73-51\n\nCORVALLIS, Oregon — Oregon State sophomore Raegan Beers scored 19 points and grabbed nine rebounds in just three quarters of play, while Dominika Paurova (17) and Timea Gardiner (12) also scored in double figures. Beers went down with a rolled ankle at the end of the third quarter and did not return, but said after the game that she \"just stepped wrong\" and will be ready for Sunday.\n\nOregon State shot 55% from the field and held EWU to just 30%. The Beavers also dominated the boards, 45-26.\n\nEastern Washington’s Jamie Loera led all scorers with 21 points, but it took her 23 shots to get there.\n\nIowa State completes historic comeback vs. Maryland behind freshman’s 40-point performance\n\nEarlier Friday, No. 11 Middle Tennessee completed an 18-point comeback to upset No. 6 Louisville and tie for the third-largest comeback in NCAA women’s tournament history.\n\nIowa State took it even further. The No. 7 Cyclones erased a 20-point deficit in the second quarter to defeat No. 10 Maryland, 93-86. The comeback win is the second largest in women’s March Madness history.\n\nIowa State freshman Audi Crooks led the charge with a career-high 40 points and 12 rebounds (18-of-20 FG, 4-of-8 FT) in her first March Madness tournament, the most scored in a debut. Senior Emily Ryan had a double-double of her own (18 points, 14 assists).\n\n“Coach (Bill Fennelly) just said if this is how you want to go out, it’s up to you,” Crooks said afterwards about Fennelly's halftime speech. “We knew right then and there we wanted to turn it around.”\n\nMaryland junior Allie Kubek led the Terrapins with a career-high 29 points off the bench and was nearly perfect, shooting 10-of-12 from the field, 7-of-8 from three and 2-of-2 from the free throw line, but it was not enough. Junior Shyanne Sellers racked up 19 points and seven rebounds, but was limited in the game due to foul trouble (four).\n\nOregon State star Raegan Beers hurt\n\nCORVALLIS, Oregon — Oregon State is rolling, up 56-39 on Eastern Washington at the end of the third quarter, but there’s trouble afoot: the Beavers All-America post Raegan Beers went down awkwardly at the end of the period clutching her right ankle, in obvious pain. After a couple minutes she managed to walk off the floor without help, but it’s unknown if she’ll be able to return in the fourth. Beers has 19 points and nine rebounds so far tonight. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nOpinion: If LSU plays like this, the Tigers will be toast, not a title team\n\nLSU sure doesn’t look like championship material.\n\nThe third-seeded Tigers had to hang on for dear life in their 70-60 win against Rice, a team so unassuming it was seeded 10th in the American Athletic Conference tournament. Don’t be fooled by the final score. This game was a lot closer than that, and the Tigers won’t be long for the NCAA Tournament unless they get things cleaned up quick.\n\nIt’s impossible to sugarcoat this one. LSU had more turnovers, a season-high 24, than it did field goals (21). And most of the miscues were self-inflicted. The Tigers were outscored in the paint 24-20. Angel Reese, the Most Outstanding Player of last year’s title game, was held to a season-low 10 points and one field goal, though she did have 19 rebounds.\n\nAbout the only good thing you could say is that LSU did win. Which, Mulkey noted, is the sole objective at this time of year. “I’m going to try to keep my composure as a coach, don’t blow it out of proportion,” Mulkey said in her post-game interview on ESPN. “We all have bad games. … Maybe they got it out of their system.”\n\nOr maybe they simply don’t have what it takes this year. Read Nancy Armour's column here.\n\nNo. 5 Colorado rolls over No. 12 Drake, 86-72\n\nBoth teams shot above 50% and had the exact same number of turnovers (19). The biggest difference was Colorado’s total domination on the glass. The Buffaloes outrebounded the Bulldogs 39-18, getting plenty of extra possessions with 15 offensive boards.\n\nCenter Aaronette Vonleh led Colorado on the glass and scoreboard with 18 points and 10 rebounds. Drake’s Katie Dinnebier led all scorers with 24 points.\n\nColorado will square off with No. 4 Kansas State on Sunday in a second-round matchup.\n\nIowa State makes double-digit comeback to tie it up against Maryland\n\nNo. 7 Iowa State was trailing by double digits at halftime, but the Cyclones outscored the No. 10 Terrapins 30-14 in the third quarter to tie it up at 66. Iowa State trailed by as many as 20 points before storming back. If the Cyclones are able to win, it will mark one of the largest comebacks in NCAA women’s tournament history.\n\nJunior Allie Kubek leads the Terrapins with 24 points off the bench (6-of-7 from three), while Iowa State freshman Audi Crooks is nearing a double-double (29 points, nine rebounds).\n\nBirthday blowout for Oregon State's Dominika Paurova?\n\nCORVALLIS, Oregon — Have a birthday, Dominika Paurova.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 freshman guard from Czech Republic is celebrating twice Friday: It’s her 19th birthday, and her parents are watching her in person for the first time in college. Clearly, both of these things have given her a lift, because she’s got 13 points in 14 minutes off the bench for the third-seeded Beavers, who are up 39-27 against Eastern Washington at halftime. Paurova also has three assists. Raegan Beers, Oregon State’s All-American in the paint, leads all scorers with 18 points. – Lindsay Schnell\n\nMaryland vs. Iowa State halftime: Terrapins up, 52-36\n\nNo. 10 Maryland has a 16-point lead over No. 7 Iowa State heading into halftime, thanks to Terrapins junior Allie Kubek’s 3-point performance. She has not missed a shot yet! Kubek, who has 19 points, knocked down five 3-pointers and is 6-of-6 from the field.\n\nMaryland is without a key piece of their offense. Lavender Briggs, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last month, averaged 8.7 points and 5.0 rebounds.\n\nEastern Washington looking for upset against Oregon State\n\nCORVALLIS, Oregon — Don’t be fooled by what you see on TV, which is empty chairs behind the visitors bench and empty bleachers across from the home bench. Those areas are reserved for Texas A&M and Nebraska fans. Gill Coliseum is full to the rafters tonight, as Beavers fans pack the gym to watch No. 3 seed Oregon State take on 14th-seeded Eastern Washington.\n\nAt the end of the first, EWU leads 18-15. The Eagles have already scored 10 points off eight Oregon State turnovers. EWU guard Jamie Loera leads all scorers with 11 points on 5-of-9 shooting.\n\nThis absolutely has the feel of a postseason game — the intensity and physicality has been turned up to 11.\n\nOne cool thing about this year’s version of the NCAA Tournament is that it features a few teams that no one thought would get to this point. Oregon State, picked to finish 10th in the Pac-12, is in that group (so is Rice, which gave LSU all it could handle earlier Friday, and Southern Cal, which earned one of the top seeds in the Portland region and tips Saturday). — Lindsay Schnell\n\nColorado vs. Drake halftime: Buffaloes up 5\n\nThe No. 5 Buffaloes are heading into halftime with a 46-41 lead. Colorado led by as many as 12 in the second quarter before Drake closed the first half on a 17-10 run.\n\nColorado junior Aaronette Vonleh almost has a double-double with 14 points and seven rebounds, while senior Maddie Nolan added eight points.\n\nBulldogs junior Katie Dinnebier has a game-high 18 points. Drake has 11 turnovers, which Colorado has converted into 17 points.\n\nAlabama vs. Florida State final: Crimson Tide rolls Seminoles despite star fouling out\n\nThings were all tied up at halftime, but No. 8 Alabama outscored No. 9 Florida State 23-11 in the third quarter. The Seminoles’ O'Mariah Gordon knocked down a three to pull within two, 74-72, with 2:20 left, but Alabama closed the game on an 8-2 run to win, 82-74.\n\nThe Crimson Tide were without senior Sarah Ashlee Barker much of the game due to foul trouble. (She fouled out with Alabama leading 70-65 with 4:42 remaining.) Freshman Essence Cody had a double-double, scoring a career-high 20 points and 14 rebounds. Senior Aaliyah Nye and sophomore Karly Weathers added 18 points each.\n\nFlorida State sophomore Ta’Niya Latson had 25 points and five assists, while junior Makayla Timpson had 14 points, four rebounds and two blocks.\n\nAlabama moves on to face No. 1 Texas.\n\nKansas State vs. Portland final: Wildcats win by 13\n\nNo. 4 Kansas State cruised to a 78-65 victory over No. 13 Portland behind a 22-point performance from senior Gabby Gregory and a near double-double from senior Ayoka Lee (21 points, nine rebounds).\n\nThe Wildcats led by as many as 20 before the Pilots cut the lead to nine with 3:25 remaining. But two key threes from Gregory and Zyanna Walker iced the game for Kansas State. Portland junior Maisie Burnham finished with a team-high 21 points and eight rebounds.\n\nKansas State moves on to face the winner of No. 5 Colorado vs. No. 12 Drake.\n\nDuke vs. Richmond final: Duke 72, Richmond 61\n\nReigan Richardson’s 25 points helped propel No. 7 Duke past a balanced attack from No. 11 Richmond, 72-61.\n\nThe Spiders kept the pressure on the Blue Devils, leading 26-23 after the first quarter and 37-28 at halftime. Richardson’s 3-pointer at 4:47 of the third quarter gave Duke the lead for good at 42-21.\n\nAshlon Jackson added 14 for Duke and Kennedy Brown had 10. Grace Townsend powered the Spiders with 18 points; Addie Budnik had 17; and Maggie Doogan chipped in 15.\n\nDuke moves on to play No. 2 Ohio State on Sunday.\n\nAlabama vs. Florida State halftime: Tied at 40\n\nIt’s even in Austin. Alabama and Florida State are tied at 40 at halftime.\n\nCrimson Tide senior Sarah Ashlee Barker was held to four first-half points due to foul trouble. She picked up two fouls in the first quarter and sat the entire second quarter. Senior Aaliyah Nye led Alabama with 11 points and three rebounds. The Crimson Tide are shooting 53.3% from the field and 5-of-10 from three.\n\nFlorida State junior Makayla Timpson has a game-high 14 points, four rebounds and two blocks. Sophomore Ta’Niya Latson added 10 points. The Seminoles are shooting 47.2% from the field and are 4-of-5 from three.\n\nAlabama needs to protect the ball better in the second half after surrendering 11 first-half turnovers, compared to Florida State’s three.\n\nLSU vs. Rice final: LSU 70, Rice 60\n\nWell that wasn’t exactly the blowout most anticipated.\n\nFour LSU players scored in double figures, led by 15 from Aneesah Morrow, and the defending champion Tigers had to play their starters almost the entire game, as 14th-seeded Rice pushed LSU to the brink before falling 70-60 in Baton Rouge. Morrow also snagged seven rebounds.\n\nThe Tigers shot 22-of-31 from the free throw line to pull away late. LSU dominated the glass, outrebounding Rice 42-29; Angel Reese had 19 boards. LSU was sloppy with the ball though, turning it over 24 times, which led to 16 points for the Owls. Suffice it to say if LSU is going to win its second consecutive title, which no team has done since 2016, the Tigers will have to play much, much better.\n\nDestiny Jackson led Rice with 15. Sophomore Flau’jae Johnson and freshman Mikaylah Williams both chipped in 14 apiece for LSU.\n\nLSU advances to play 11th-seeded Middle Tennessee, which upset sixth-seeded Louisville earlier Friday.\n\nVirginia Tech vs. Marshall final: Hokies dominate, 92-49\n\nNo Elizabeth Kitley, no problem for Virginia Tech … yet. The No. 4 Hokies routed No. 13 Marshall, 92-49.\n\nVirginia Tech, which led by as many as 47 points, shot 53.8% from the field and 10-of-23 from the line. Senior Georgia Amoore was held to nine points due to foul trouble, but junior Matilda Ekh exploded for 21 points and three rebounds. Center Clara Strack added 17 points, five rebounds and four blocks, while senior Olivia Summiel had a game-high 14 rebounds.\n\nMarshall senior Abby Beeman, who finished with 12 points and five rebounds, was the only Thundering Herd player in double digits. The team shot 24.4% from the field and 6-of-41 from the three-point line.\n\nVirginia Tech will face the winner of No. 5 Baylor vs. No. 12 Vanderbilt.\n\nUpset alert: LSU pulling away from Rice after third quarter\n\nWhen you’re trying to pull away, it helps to hit six of your last eight shots.\n\nThat’s exactly what LSU did late in the third quarter, which helped the Tigers to a 53-42 advantage. Also helpful: Angel Reese, the defending Most Outstanding Player, recording her 13th straight double-double (10 points, 18 rebounds). They ended the period on a 13-4 run.\n\nAnother major stat in LSU’s favor: The Tigers have shot 23 free throws, connecting on 16 (70%). Meanwhile, Rice hasn’t been to the foul line once.\n\nLet’s be clear about something: Rice really has no business being here. Or so the naysayers thought.\n\nThe 10th (10th!) seed in the American Athletic Conference tournament, Rice earned an automatic bid when it beat ninth-seeded East Carolina in the title game. Given that seeding and a surprise championship, no one would have been surprised if the Owls had walked into the home of the defending champs and been so wide-eyed, LSU blew them out from the jump.\n\nBut Rice clearly has other plans.\n\nThe Owls held LSU without a field goal in the last 3:45 of the first half, and hit a couple key shots to pull within three, 30-27, at halftime. LSU guard Aneesah Morrow, the super transfer from DePaul, leads all scorers with 10 points. Morrow also has three rebounds.\n\nMeanwhile, Emily Klaczek has nine points for Rice, all on 3s.\n\nThe Owls have forced the Tigers into 13 turnovers, and scored 11 points off those turnovers. How long can Rice keep this up?\n\nTexas vs. Drexel final: Longhorns blow out Dragons, 82-42\n\nNo. 16 seed Drexel was no match for No. 1 seed Texas, which dominated the Dragons in an 82-42 wire-to-wire victory where the Longhorns led by as many as 45 points.\n\nSenior Shaylee Gonzales had a game-high 21 points, three steals and two assists, while senior Taylor Jones added 18 points, two rebounds and one assist. Freshman Madison Booker was close to a double-double with eight points and 14 assists.\n\nDrexel junior Amaris Baker was the only Dragon in double digits with 10 points and one assist.\n\nThe Longhorns outscored the Dragons 44-16 in the paint. Texas shot 43.7% from the field and 5-of-10 from three, while Drexel shot 35.3% from the field and 3-of-14 from three. The Dragons had 21 turnovers and only converted 3-of-6 free throws, compared to Texas going 15-of-21 from the line.\n\nTexas will face the winner of No. 8 Alabama and No. 9 Florida State.\n\nThundering Herd bitten by foul trouble\n\nIt’s been a rough day for the Marshall Thundering Herd — and it’s still early in the third quarter.\n\nAside from the fact that Marshall, known for shooting a ton of 3s, isn’t hitting from outside today (the Herd is shooting just 14% at 3-of-22), guard Ashley Tudor fouled out with 6:34 to play in the third. It’s rough when you’ve recorded more fouls (five) than minutes (four). She went 0-for-1 from the field.\n\nThe junior guard doesn’t contribute much, averaging just 2.5 points and 2.2 rebounds, but losing a fresh body is a big blow, especially when you need contributions from everyone to get back in this game. Virginia Tech leads Marshall 60-31 with 5:40 to play in the third.\n\nCaitlin Clark on her final tournament: 'You've got to enjoy the moments'\n\nAs Caitlin Clark prepares for her last March Madness, she sounds relaxed and comfortable with where she and her team are situated. Clark and the No. 1 seed Hawkeyes open against Holy Cross on Saturday at 3 p.m. ET.\n\nClark, who will graduate this spring, is trying to keep perspective.\n\n“You can't be too worried about when it's going to end or how it's going to end,” Clark said. “You've just got to enjoy the moments … and don't let them pass you by.”\n\nThe all-time leading scorer in Division I, she declared for the WNBA draft last month and is expected to go No. 1 to the Indiana Fever.\n\n“It’s honestly gone really fast, and obviously this last year has been really crazy. … just getting to enjoy these last few months of basketball with my best friends has been really fun.”\n\nMORE:See which celebrity NCAA brackets have Hawkeyes winning\n\nSo what are the chances Iowa makes it back to the championship game?\n\n“I have four other people on the court with me at the same time, and I can rely on them. I'm going to need them if we want to reach our goals in March. It can't just be me.”\n\nLargest comebacks in women's March Madness history\n\nWhere does MTSU's comeback rank in women's NCAA Tournament history?

News Journal\n\nLouisville senior Merissah Russell apologizes for loss, vows comeback\n\nThe flip side to all the fun of March Madness is heartbreak, and it was on full display in Louisville’s postgame news conference.\n\nSenior Merissah Russell broke down in tears as she apologized to the coaching staff and fans for the Cardinals’ 71-69 upset loss to 11th-seeded Middle Tennessee State. It’s Louisville’s first loss in the first round since 2006 and the first under head coach Jeff Walz.\n\n“This hurts,” Russell said, beginning to cry. “We know the culture here, we know the standards here and this isn’t it. … It’s not who we are.\n\n“I feel like a failure,” she added as Walz reached over and rubbed her back to try and comfort her.\n\nLouisville led by 18 in the first half. But the Cardinals have struggled to put games away all season and this was no different. They were outscored 15-10 in the second quarter and doubled up – 24-12 – in the third.\n\nThey still had a chance to win, but Russell’s last-second 3-pointer clanged off the rim.\n\nThough Walz said after the game he takes responsibility for the loss, Russell wasn’t having it. Nor does she want to hear criticism of him.\n\n“We’re coming back because of him,” Russell said. “We’re going to go further in the tournament next year because of him.”\n\nVirginia Tech vs. Marshall halftime: Hokies lead 42-25\n\nNo. 4 seed Virginia Tech opened its first-round matchup against No. 13 Marshall on a 13-0 run. The Thundering Herd cut the lead to single digits before the Hokies went on a 10-0 run to close the half. Virginia Tech leads by 17 at halftime.\n\nThe Hokies have dominated the Thundering Herd in the paint, outscoring them 16-8. Marshall has resorted to shooting from beyond the arc, but only knocked down 3-of-19 threes in the first half.\n\nVirginia Tech center Clara Strack has a team-high 14 points, two rebounds and two blocks, while senior Cayla King added seven points, three rebounds and two steals. Senior Georgia Amoore, who found herself in early foul trouble and sat the entire second quarter, was held to four points.\n\nMarshall senior Mahogany Matthew scored seven points, and had one block and one steal. Sophomore Meredith Maier has six points and two rebounds. No Thundering Herd player is in double digits. They are shooting 27% from the field, while Virginia Tech is shooting 59.1% from the field and 4-of-9 from three.\n\nThe Hokies are without center Elizabeth Kitley, a three-time ACC player of the year, the entire tournament after she suffered a knee injury in the regular-season finale at Virginia.\n\nWho will Middle Tennessee play next after Louisville upset?\n\nAfter making one of the largest comebacks in NCAA women’s tournament history with its upset of Louisville, the No. 11 seed MTSU Blue Raiders will face the winner of No. 3 LSU vs. No. 14 Rice in the second round of the Albany 2 region bracket. LSU is the defending NCAA champion.\n\nMiddle Tennessee vs. Louisville final: Blue Raiders upset Cardinals, 71-69\n\nNo. 11 seed Middle Tennessee completed a double-digit comeback to upset No. 6 seed Louisville on Friday, tying the third-largest comeback in women’s tournament history.\n\nIt came down to the final seconds. Louisville’s Sydney Taylor hit a three-point shot with 4 seconds remaining to cut MTSU’s lead to 71-69. Blue Raiders Ta'Mia Scott missed both free throws that would have iced the game and the Blue Raiders rebounded the ball with 3 seconds left. Cardinals’ Merissah Russell heaved up a half-court shot that narrowly missed, hitting the backboard and the rim as time expired.\n\nThe Blue Raiders trailed by as many as 18 points in the first half before outscoring the Cardinals 44-31 in the second half.\n\nMTSU senior Savannah Wheeler had 22 points — 20 in the second half — two rebounds and two steals. Senior Jalynn Gregory had a game-high 24 points, four assists and three rebounds. Middle Tennessee shot 39.2% from the field and 8-for-23 from three.\n\nThe win marks the Blue Raiders’ first in the tournament since 2007. It also marks the first March Madness first-round loss suffered by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz, who entered Friday’s matchup 14-0 in opening-round games.\n\nCardinals forward Olivia Cochran had a double-double with 17 points and 10 rebounds, while Nina Rickards had 12 points and five rebounds. The team shot 39.7% from the field and 6-of-19 from three.\n\nLouisville is the only team in the country to have played in each of the past five Elite Eights. The Cardinals have advanced to the round of 16 in six consecutive seasons and the round of eight in each of the past five seasons.\n\nUpset watch: Louisville in trouble\n\nLouisville trails Middle Tennessee State 64-60 with a minute left to play. Louisville entered the day 14-0 in NCAA tournament first-round games under coach Jeff Walz. The Cardinals have advanced to the round of 16 in six consecutive seasons and is the only team in the country to have played in each of the past five Elite Eights.\n\nBut Louisville skidded into the NCAA tournament. It lost six of its last 11 games, and barely got by Boston College in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament. After that game, coach Jeff Walz joked he was going to go to a bar before getting back to work. \"Hopefully it will make this game look a lot better when I watch it on film, blurry possibly,\" he said.\n\nThe Cardinals lost to Notre Dame the following day, committing 20 turnovers for a second consecutive game. \"We've got to care. The ball has to matter. Every possession matters,\" Walz said after that game. \"We're going to work for a week and a half on just grinding that in and instilling that into them.\"\n\nUpset watch: Middle Tennessee takes lead from Louisville\n\nMiddle Tennessee State now has all of the momentum — and a lead against Louisville. Again, the Cardinals led this game 38-20.\n\n11th-seeded Middle Tennessee State will take a 51-50 lead to the fourth quarter against No. 6 seed Louisville, which is having all kinds of fouling problems. In the third quarter, the Blue Raiders made 5 of 7 field goals (4 of 4 three-pointers) and 10 of a whopping 13 free throw attempts. And MTSU's top player, guard Savannah Wheeler, who has just two points in the first half, now has 16 points.\n\nUpset watch: Richmond leads Duke\n\nNo. 10 seed Richmond leads No. 7 Duke, 26-23, at the end of the first quarter. The Spiders shot the ball at a stunning identical clip: 5 for 7 from three point range, 5 for 7 from two-point range. That's 71.4% and a totally different deal from what happened when teams met earlier this season. After one quarter of that game, Duke led 18-9; it went on to win 83-53.\n\nSouth Carolina star Te-Hina Paopao cheered on by father\n\nTe-Hina Paopao had some very special fans in attendance for South Carolina’s first-round game.\n\nHer father, Paul, was watching her play in person for the first time since she transferred to South Carolina. Her parents don’t like to travel, and their home is clear across the country in Oceanside, California.\n\nFamily is big for Paopao, and ESPN showed a clip of her emotional reunion with her father ahead of the game. Also making the trip was her adorable niece, who is also named Te-Hina. - Nancy Armour\n\nLouisville lead slips away\n\nMiddle Tennessee State, which trailed Louisville by 38-20 with four minutes left in the second quarter but closed the first half on a 7-0 run, has continued to close on the Cardinals early in the third quarter.\n\nLouisville's lead is down to 44-40 with four minutes left in the third quarter. MTSU has made 3 of 3 three-pointers in the third quarter. - Steve Berkowitz\n\nSouth Carolina steamrolls Presbyterian, 91-39\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. − Sophomore forward Chloe Kitts tied a career high with 21 points and went 9-for-9 from the field, leading South Carolina women's basketball to an easy 91-39 opening win over Presbyterian at Colonial Life Arena.\n\nDespite missing senior center Kamilla Cardoso and junior guard Bree Hall, the shorthanded No. 1 Gamecocks (33-0) dispatched the No. 16 Blue Hose (21-15).\n\nHall did not play for precautionary reasons, according to the school. Cardoso was serving a one-game suspension for her role in a fight against LSU in the SEC Tournament championship.\n\nFreshman guard MiLaysia Fulwiley scored 17 points and made a career-high five 3-pointers to help the Gamecocks. Senior guard Te-Hina Paopao scored 18 and made four 3-pointers. – The Greenville News\n\nSeinfeld creator Larry David not March Madness fan, but he knows Caitlin Clark\n\nLarry David, who co-created Seinfeld and whose show \"Curb Your Enthusiasm,\" highlights his cringe-worthy antics, is not a fan of March Madness. During an interview with Rich Eisen on Thursday, David said he had enough teams to track – he’s a fan of New York’s Knicks and Rangers.\n\n\"This is insane, I don't know anything!\" David said on a recent appearance on \"The Rich Eisen Show\" when asked if he fills out a bracket.\n\n\"How much can I follow sports? I’m supposed to know who’s on Drake? It’s crazy! … I can't follow all these teams, how do people do it?\" David asks incredulously. \"I can't name one college player. Not one. I can't give you one name!\"\n\nTo which Eisen responded, \"Well, I'm sure you've seen Caitlin Clark.\" David said, \"Yes! That's the only one. She's the only one.\" - Heather Tucker\n\nSouth Carolina dominates, as reserves score 19 points\n\nAgain, all things are relative if you're a No. 16 seed trying to deal with playing No. 1 seed and undefeated South Carolina on its home floor. So while Presbyterian trails 38-20 midway through the second quarter, keep in mind that Presbyterian scored a total of 29 points against the Gamecocks in a game earlier this season. On the other hand — in further evidence of South Carolina's depth, the Gamecocks' reserves have scored 19 points themselves.\n\nSouth Carolina takes off vs. Presbyterian\n\nSouth Carolina looking comfortable in building a 15-8 lead with 3 1/2 minutes left in the first quarter. For Presbyterian, this is a significant improvement over what happened in the teams' meeting earlier this season. At the same point in that game, South Carolina led 23-7.\n\nSavannah Wheeler scores first basket for MTSU\n\nWith less than a minute left in the first half, MTSU's leading scorer, Savannah Wheeler finally gets her first basket of the game. It's part of a 7-0 run that has gotten the Blue Raiders back to within 38-27.\n\nNo. 1 South Carolina tips off vs. Presbyterian\n\nWith No. 1 seed South Carolina getting underway against Presbyterian, a reminder that these teams met earlier this season, on Dec. 16 in Columbia -- and the Gamecocks won, 99-29. Yes, it was 99-29.\n\nLouisville starts strong vs. Middle Tennessee\n\nLouisville has gotten off to a quick start against No. 11 seed Middle Tennessee State in a game being played in Baton Rouge. The Cardinals lead 35-20 midway through the second quarter. Louisville is shooting 53%, including 4 for 8 from three-point range. MTSU's Savannah Wheeler, who entered the game averaging 16.6 points per game, is scoreless so far on 0 for 6 shooting from the field.\n\nFAU-Northwestern men's game interrupted by royal family announcement\n\nThose watch Northwestern vs. Florida Atlantic got to see a major news announcement, when the CBS broadcast cut to Kate Middleton’s announcement she is receiving treatment for cancer.\n\nThe cut-in happened during a timeout in the action, and after the announcement aired, the broadcast went back to the game. Everything we know about the announcement here. - Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 7 Duke vs. No. 10 Richmond tips off at 2:30 p.m. ET\n\nLooking ahead to next game in Columbus, Ohio: It's No. 7 seed Duke against No. 10 Richmond, which is making its first NCAA tournament appearance since 2005 and coming off winning its first conference championship since 1991 in what was then known as the Colonial Athletic Association. These teams met in their season opener, on Nov. 6 at Duke. The Blue Devils won that game 83-53. Since then, however, the Spiders have gone 29-4,\n\nCaitlin Clark has a fan in Tim McGraw\n\nTim McGraw knows how to play to the crowd.\n\nMcGraw wore a Caitlin Clark jersey during his concert in Des Moines on Thursday night. Her black road jersey, to be specific. The country superstar also used an image of Clark as his backdrop at Wells Fargo Arena.\n\nRead more from Nancy Armour, and see the pictures.\n\nOhio State beats Maine 80-57\n\nOhio State continued to expand its lead over Maine, and ended up with a 80-57 victory. Up next for the Buckeyes will be either No. 7 seed Duke or No. 10 seed Richmond.\n\nOhio State's Jacy Sheldon put together 19 points (surpassing 2,000 for her career), four rebounds and four assists. Cotie McMahon added 13 points. Maine's Anne Simon — in the final game of a career that included two America East Conference player of the year awards — scored 25 points.\n\nNorth Carolina coach Courtney Banghart wins big bonus\n\nNorth Carolina's win gives Tar Heels coach Courtney Banghart the 350th victory of her career. It also gives her a $50,000 bonus — not for that milestone, but for reaching the tournament's round of 32. UNC will play South Carolina on Sunday. It's a rematch for the teams, which met on Nov. 30 in Chapel Hill with South Carolina winning, 65-58.\n\nNorth Carolina beats Michigan State: Deja Kelly free throws clutch\n\nDeja Kelly makes the first of two free throws, then misses the second — but she gets the rebound and gets fouled again. She again goes 1 for 2, but UNC's Alyssa Ustby got another offensive rebound (UNC's 18th of the game) and the Tar Heels win 59-56.\n\nMichigan State's monster run\n\nAfter North Carolina's Deja Kelly made one of two free throws, Michigan State's Tory Ozment hit a layup and the Spartans keep closing in on the Tar Heels. That makes it an 11-1 run here by Michigan State, which had trailed by as many as 16 points.\n\nAfter North Carolina's Lexi Donarski made two free throws, Michigan State's Theryn Hallock hit a three-pointer -- and the Spartans are now within 57-56 with 5.4 seconds to play.\n\nMaine hangs in vs. Ohio State entering final quarter\n\nMaine regrouped at halftime and played Ohio State nearly even in the third quarter. But the Buckeyes lead 66-54 heading to the fourth quarter — and they exceeded 20 points in each of the first three.\n\nMichigan State holds on\n\nWell, just when it appeared that North Carolina had matters in hand against Michigan State, the Spartans have put together a 7-0 run to get within 54-49 with 48.2 seconds left.\n\nAnd with a steal and score by DeeDee Hagemann, Michigan State is within 54-51 with 30.6 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nNorth Carolina pulls away from Michigan State\n\nNorth Carolina has gradually added to its lead over Michigan State as the fourth quarter has progressed. The Tar Heels lead 54-44 with two minutes to play as senior guard Alyssa Ustby has taken charge, totaling 16 points, 16 rebounds and six assists. Earlier this season, against Syracuse, Ustby picked up the first triple-double in UNC. That feat came amid an increase in women's speed of play that USA TODAY Sports' Lindsay Schnell reports on here.\n\nMiddle Tennessee vs. Louisville tips off at 1:30 p.m. ET\n\nLooking ahead to the third game of the day in the women's tournament: It's No. 11 seed Middle Tennessee playing No. 6 Louisville in Baton Rouge.\n\nThese teams actually are familiar with each other. MTSU routed Louisville, 67-49, in a regular-season game early in December in Murfreesboro.\n\nThe Cardinals regrouped to make a run to the NCAA tournament final eight — the fifth consecutive season in which they accomplished that feat. Louisville also will be looking to make it 15-0 in first-round games under coach Jeff Walz, and make it seven consecutive appearances in the NCAA round of 16.\n\nShould they win, a former Cardinal is likely waiting for them in the second round: Hailey Van Lith, who earned All-American honors last year for Louisville before transferring to LSU in the offseason.\n\nSisters Teonni and Tamari Key star in March Madness\n\nIt’s going to be a busy weekend for Tammy Brown.\n\nBrown has two daughters playing in March Madness this year: Teonni Key is a sophomore guard/forward for eighth-seeded North Carolina, currently up 48-37 on ninth-seeded Michigan State in the fourth quarter. And Tamari, a senior for the sixth-seeded Tennessee Lady Vols.\n\nTennessee takes on 11th-seeded Green Bay, with tip scheduled for 12 p.m. ET Saturday. Can Tammy get there in time? Read more. - Lindsay Schnell\n\nNorth Carolina leads Michigan State entering final quarter\n\nMichigan State and North Carolina played to a stalemate in the third quarter of their game. North Carolina won the quarter 9-8, but neither team scored during the final 2:50. For the quarter, Michigan State made 3 of 12 shots, North Carolina 4 of 18. The Tar Heels will take a 44-35 lead to the fourth quarter.\n\nMaine star Adrianna Smith rolls ankle\n\nTrailing 40-22 late the second quarter, Maine had an even worse development in the final minute of the second quarter when second-leading scorer Adrianna Smith stepped on a Ohio State player's foot and appeared to badly roll an ankle. She came into the game averaging 16.6 points per game. She had to be helped off the court. For one final bit of adversity, Ohio State hit a three-pointer at the halftime buzzer to extend its lead to 43-24. For the second quarter, the Buckeyes outscored Maine, 21-8.\n\nOhio State's Jacy Sheldon passes 2,000 points\n\nOhio State grad student guard Jacy Sheldon just surpassed 2,000 points for her career with a layup she converted into a three-point play. She is the eighth Ohio State player to reach 2,000 points for her career.\n\nNo one in the gym is more excited about this milestone than Jacy's sister, Emmy, who is a big part of Ohio State's program.\n\nOhio State gaining on Maine\n\nJust over halfway through the second quarter, Ohio State has started to gain control of its game against Maine. The margin was 22-16 after one quarter. It's now 35-18, as Maine has racked up 12 turnovers, equaling its season average. Three of Maine's starters now have two fouls, including leading scorer Anne Simon.\n\nWhen does Caitlin Clark play next?\n\nIowa star Caitlin Clark is tipping off in her final March Madness at 3 p.m. Saturday. Clark and Iowa begin their bid to return to the NCAA women's national championship game as the No. 1 Hawkeyes take on No. 16 Holy Cross, which blew out UT Martin in the the First Four on Thursday. This is the first time Iowa has received a No. 1 seed in the tournament since 1992. — Cydney Henderson\n\nGet to know Maine coach Amy Vachon\n\nWhile Maine certainly faces an uphill proposition against Ohio State, the Black Bears have a steady and tournament-experienced hand with coach Amy Vachon. Vachon, who attended Maine, participated in four NCAA tournaments as a player and has taken the school to two previous NCAA tournament appearances as a coach. Part of playing experience included being the point guard for a team that beat Stanford in a first round game in 1999 — Maine's only NCAA tournament win.\n\nMaine vs. Ohio State tips off\n\nAfter one quarter, 15th-seeded Maine is hanging in against Ohio State in Columbus. The Black Bears are with 22-16, as they shot 6 for 9 from the field, including 4 for 6 from three-point range. But a potential sign: Maine committed its eighth turnover at the start of the second quarter, and its ninth shortly after. Ohio State has two turnovers so far.\n\nMaine has averaged 12 turnovers per game this season. The team's high this year was 22, twice: vs. LaSalle (Nov. 9) and New Hampshire (Jan. 11). Ohio State averages 13.5 turnovers per game, but its opponents this season have averaged 21.2.\n\nHalftime score: UNC 35, Michigan State 27\n\nMichigan State managed to cut its 16-point, mid-second-quarter deficit to eight points late in the quarter, but then with 36.8 seconds left in the half, leading scorer Julia Ayrault committed her third foul. The Spartans scored again just before the buzzer to make it 35-27, but their top two scorers will begin the third quarter with three fouls apiece. Moira Joiner committed her third early in the second quarter.\n\nFoul trouble for Spartans stars Moira Joiner, Julia Ayrault\n\nMichigan State managed to get its offense going a bit against North Carolina, but then three minutes into the second quarter, the team's second-leading scorer, guard Moira Joiner, committed her third foul. That meant the Spartans' top two scorers, Joiner and Julia Ayrault, both were in foul trouble with more than half of the quarter remaining.\n\nJoiner sat out for about two minutes, then returned. But North Carolina extended its lead to 30-14, prompting Spartans coach Robyn Fralick to call for a timeout with just over four minutes left before halftime.\n\nMichigan State women's basketball struggling vs. North Carolina\n\nThe first quarter of North Carolina-Michigan State could not have gone much better for the Tar Heels — or much worse for the Spartans. Michigan State trailed 23-7 before scoring the final three point of the quarter. Amid that was a 16-2 run for North Carolina, which ended the quarter 10 of 19 from the field while Michigan State shot 3 of 10. The differential in shot attempts was largely due to Michigan State committing seven turnovers in the quarter. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nNorth Carolina's Alyssa Ustby is doing it all vs. Michigan State\n\nAlyssa Ustby is the epitome of a do-everything player for North Carolina. After just one quarter the 6-foot-1 guard already has eight points, five rebounds, two assists and one block as UNC leads Michigan State 23-10 at the end of the first quarter.\n\nEarlier this season, the senior recorded the program’s first-ever triple-double in an upset win over Syracuse (at the time, UNC was not ranked, but ‘Cuse was). Afterward, UNC coach Courtney Banghart told reporters that she and Ustby had a frank conversation early in the ACC season during which Banghart emphasized that good players have to play well in big games. Clearly, Ustby took those words to heart against Syracuse and today against Michigan State. Also of note: Banghart said that triple-double record came, in part, because of how much faster the women’s game is getting. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nUNC rides layups to get early lead vs. Michigan State\n\nNorth Carolina has jumped out to 15-5 lead on Michigan State, and all of the Tar Heels' points have come on layups. Making matters worse for the Spartans, their leading scorer, grad student Julia Ayrault has already committed her second foul. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nUNC impressing early vs. Michigan State\n\nNorth Carolina has been inconsistent all season, but the way they look the first four minutes against Michigan State is reinforcing to me that when they want to be, they're a top 20 team. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nNo. 8 North Carolina vs. No. 9 Michigan State underway\n\nDon’t be fooled by the seeds here for No. 8 North Carolina and No. 9 Michigan State. Either of these teams could make life difficult for top-ranked South Carolina — once they get past each other. The game is airing and streaming now on ESPN2. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nWomen’s March Madness schedule today, by TV channel and time\n\nHere is the complete NCAA women's tournament schedule for Friday's first-round games.\n\nESPN\n\nNoon: No. 2 Ohio State (25-5) vs. No. 15 Maine (24-9)\n\nNo. 2 Ohio State (25-5) vs. No. 15 Maine (24-9) 2 p.m.: No. 1 South Carolina (32-0) vs. No. 16 Presbyterian\n\nNo. 1 South Carolina (32-0) vs. No. 16 Presbyterian 4 p.m.: No. 3 LSU (28-5) vs. No. 14 Rice (19-14)\n\nESPN2\n\nESPNU\n\nESPNews\n\n2:30 p.m.: No. 7 Duke (20-11) vs. No. 10 Richmond (29-5)\n\nNo. 7 Duke (20-11) vs. No. 10 Richmond (29-5) 4:30 p.m.: No. 4 Kansas State (25-7) vs. No. 13 Portland (21-12)\n\nNo. 4 Kansas State (25-7) vs. No. 13 Portland (21-12) 7 p.m.: No. 5 Colorado (22-9) vs. No. 12 Drake (29-5)\n\nWhat to know about UNC head coach Courtney Bangart\n\nIt's funny that Courtney Bangart, the UNC women's basketball coach, wound up at arguably the most dominant women's soccer school in the country. She was originally supposed to play soccer at Dartmouth. Then the Dartmouth coach got the job at Stanford, called Bangart and said she was welcome to come to Stanford with him if she wanted, presumably on some sort of scholarship because Stanford had athletic scholarships, whereas the Ivy League doesn't. She was so in love with Dartmouth that instead she called the Dartmouth basketball coach and asked if she could play basketball instead. That kicked off her hoops career at the collegiate level, but she still has soccer in her veins, because whenever she talks about taking a player one-on-one she says one-v-one like they do in soccer. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nNorth Carolina-Michigan State history\n\nToday's game between No. 8 seed North Carolina and No. 9 Michigan State makes for an interesting event for Michigan State President Kevin Guskiewicz. He began the job in East Lansing on March 4 — after being North Carolina's chancellor since 2019 and a member of the UNC faculty since 1995. And Guskiewicz is no stranger to sports. He's a renown researcher on concussions in sports and has been involved in the NCAA and NFL setting guidelines concerning the treatment of players who suffer a concussion. — Steve Berkowitz\n\nWomen’s March Madness players to watch\n\nHere are the players in action this afternoon in the NCAA women's tournament.\n\nNorth Carolina G Deja Kelly (16.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 3.3 apg), can take over a game at any time\n\nOhio State F Cotie McMahon (14.1 ppg, 6.5 rpg), who plays with a tremendous balance of passion and poise\n\nSouth Carolina G Te-Hina Paopao (47.1% from 3), the most impactful transfer of the 2023-24 season\n\nTexas G Madison Booker (16.9 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 4.9 apg), who doesn’t play like a rookie\n\nVirginia Tech G Georgia Amoore (19.2 ppg, 6.9 apg), one of the top floor generals in the country\n\n— Lindsay Schnell\n\nWhen does Caitlin Clark play next?\n\nIowa star Caitlin Clark is tipping off in her final March Madness at 3 p.m. Saturday. Clark and Iowa begin their bid to return to the NCAA women's national championship game as the No. 1 Hawkeyes take on No. 16 Holy Cross, which blew out UT Martin in the the First Four on Thursday. This is the first time Iowa has received a No. 1 seed in the tournament since 1992. — Cydney Henderson\n\nWomen's college basketball is faster than it's ever been. Result: More records falling\n\nShortly after Alyssa Ustby recorded the first triple-double in North Carolina women’s basketball history in early January, coach Courtney Banghart was asked: Why are so many records being broken lately in women’s college basketball? What’s different about now compared to, say, 10 years ago?\n\n“The game is so fast,” Banghart said, shaking her head in awe. “There’s so many possessions — the stats guys might know that better than me — but the talent level and speed of play is remarkable. I’ve been in this game a long time and (players today) can all do so much with the ball. There’s just more versatility as well as athleticism, and that leads to more possessions and more impact on the game.”\n\nAs the women’s tournament tips off Friday, more eyeballs are on the game than ever. Much of that attention can be directly attributed to Caitlin Clark, the Iowa superstar who has spent her four-year career shattering records (and TV ratings).

You’ve picked a great time to join the party, given the star power of players like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, who are playing in their last March Madness. But don’t worry, there’s plenty of young superstars in the game too, from JuJu Watkins (Southern Cal) to Hannah Hidalgo (Notre Dame)to Madison Booker (Texas) and a whole host of others.\n\nFilling out men’s brackets has always been par for the course but this year, nearly every bracket competition has seen a significant uptick in people filling out women’s brackets.

In the class, students will take a deep dive into Beyoncé's career and examine how she has brought on more awareness and engagement in social and political doctrines.\n\nThe class will utilize the singer's expansive music catalogue, spanning from her 2013 self-titled album up to her history making album \"Cowboy Carter\" as tools for learning. Brooks also plans to use Beyoncé's music as a vehicle to teach students about other notable Black intellectuals throughout history, such as Toni Morrison and Frederick Douglass.\n\nAs fans know, Beyoncé, who is already the most awarded artist in Grammy history, recently made history again as the most nominated artist with a total of 99, after receiving 11 more nods at the 2025 Grammy Awards for her eighth studio album \"Cowboy Carter.\" She released the album March 29 and has since made history, broken multiple records and put a huge spotlight on Black country artists and the genre's roots.\n\nNeed a break?

There have actually been quite a few.\n\nRiché Richardson, professor of African American literature at Cornell University and the Africana Research Center, created a class called \"Beyoncénation\" to explore her impact on sectors including fashion, music, business, social justice and motherhood.\n\n“Beyoncé has made a profound impact on national femininity,” Richardson told USA TODAY. “It’s interesting because traditionally for Black women, there's been this sense that there are certain hardships that they have encountered [and therefore] marriage and education have been seen as being mutually exclusive.”\n\nAnd Erik Steinskog, associate professor of musicology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, also felt compelled to create a Beyoncé course back in 2017 centered on race and gender.\n\nSteinskog looked at the singer's music and ideologies through an international lens.\n\n\"I, at the time and still, see Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' as one of the masterpieces of the 21st century of music,\" he said. \"I wanted to introduce Black feminism to my students as sort of a contrast to how feminism is often perceived in Europe.\"\n\nFollow Caché McClay, the USA TODAY Network's Beyoncé Knowles-Carter reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @cachemcclay.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/06/14/barron-trump-college-celebrity-children-affleck-suri-fieri-gwyneth-bezos/74085160007/", "title": "Barron Trump: College or gap year?

But when the coronavirus pandemic struck, claiming millions of lives around the world and shutting down life as we know it, her class became more important than ever.\n\n“People were getting great evidence-based advice about how to protect their physical health – mask up, socially distance, get a vaccine – but people were struggling with what to do to protect their mental health,” Santos told CNN.\n\nIn April 2019, Santos had 22,522 new enrollments. But in April 2020, as the pandemic started to take off, the class saw 860,494 new enrollments – and it only continued to skyrocket.\n\nSantos and her students during one of her lectures. Karin Shedd/Yale University\n\nSo far, more than 3.7 million people have enrolled in the class, which is available for free online through Coursera and is also being taught in person for the second time this semester.\n\nThe course went online for free about two years ago under the name “The Science of Well Being,” according to the Yale Daily News. Anyone can audit the course for free, and $49 lets you complete assignments, submit them for a grade and earn a certificate of completion.\n\nSantos’ class focuses on understanding and letting go of all the superficial notions of happiness, such as the idea that a better job, fancier house, or a new relationship is the next step closer to happiness.\n\n“All of us want to be happier,” Santos said. “The problem is that we have a lot of misconceptions about what really will make us happy. We think we need to change our circumstances in major ways, but often simply behavioral and mindset changes can make a big difference in our sense of well-being.”\n\nSome of the professor’s “happiness” assignments include deleting social media accounts, daily meditation, keeping a gratitude journal, and investing time in loved ones.\n\nStudents also receive a series of homework “rewirements,” or practices aimed at helping students develop better habits, according to Santos. These include making more time for exercise and sleep, engaging in more social connection and random acts of kindness, taking time to savor and experience more gratitude, and mindfulness.\n\n“I’ve personally become a lot happier as a result of teaching the class,” Santos said. “It’s given me a lot more meaning and purpose, but it also means I need to practice what I preach and make sure I’m putting in the time to focus on my own well-being.”\n\nAn intervention study written by Santos and four other researchers analyzing the impact of her class concluded taking the class allows people to show a significant improvement on a standard happiness scale, exhibiting about a one-point increase on the 10-point scale.\n\n“The present study demonstrated that well-being can be enhanced by taking a large-scale, free, online course,” the study read. “These results suggest that individuals who are exposed to academic content on the science of well-being and who engage in evidence-based practices can indeed increase their subjective well-being.”\n\nThe study also showed how free, online classes can “impact mental health at large scales, and thus could become an important tool for public health initiatives aimed at improving population-wide mental health outcomes.”", "authors": ["Alaa Elassar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/04/30/ivy-league-colleges/8466345/", "title": "Ivy League whiz kid picks his college: Yale", "text": "Greg Toppo\n\nUSATODAY\n\nKwasi Enin has his pick of the USA's elite colleges, but the one he says has the sweetest song won his heart: Yale.\n\nEnin, 17, made international news last month when USA TODAY and other news media reported that he'd been accepted by all eight Ivy League colleges, an extremely rare feat.\n\nA senior at William Floyd High School in Mastic Beach, N.Y., Enin plans to attend Yale University in New Haven, Conn., this fall. He announced his decision Wednesday at a news conference in the school's gymnasium.\n\nGetting into just one of the eight is a feat — Cornell University, which accepts a larger share of applicants than the other seven, admitted 14% in its most recent round. At the other end, Harvard admitted 5.9%. Enin also earned slots at Duke University and three State University of New York campuses.\n\nHe visited Yale last week and says he was blown away by the music scene on campus — he says it has the strongest music program of all the Ivy League schools — and a commitment to giving undergraduates research and travel opportunities. He looks forward to singing in one of Yale's dozens of a capella groups and playing in one of its orchestras, he says.\n\nA first-generation American from Shirley, N.Y., who sings and plays the viola, Enin plans to study medicine and music. After visiting four of the eight schools, he says, at Yale \"I met people who were just like me — diverse in both science and music – and they told me how manageable it is doing both.\"\n\nEnin declined to provide details about the financial aid he'll receive from Yale but says he got similar offers from all four schools that were at the top of his list. \"I'm very satisfied with my offer,\" he says of Yale. \"They're very generous on their aid.\"\n\nEnin's story, which broke this month, made him an instant celebrity, getting interview offers from around the world. He appeared on Late Night With David Letterman to read the comedian's \"Top Ten Ways to Make Your College Application Stand Out.\" No. 1: \"In the part that says, 'For Office Use Only,' write, 'Accept.' \"\n\nEnin is the son of Ghanaian immigrants who came to New York in the 1980s and studied nursing at public colleges. He ranks No. 11 in a class of 647 at William Floyd, a large public school on Long Island's south shore. His SAT score, at 2,250 out of 2,400 points, puts him in the 99th percentile for all test-takers. He will have taken 11 Advanced Placement courses by the time he graduates this spring.\n\nHe says he has been amazed by the \"craziness\" of some of the reactions to his story. Many commenters noted that Ivy League schools often reject other candidates with higher SAT scores and class rankings. A few readers said that as the son of recent African immigrants, Enin has bypassed much of the struggle that African-American teenagers experience.\n\nOne commenter, Humza Azam, said, \"I have better stats,\" noting a 2,260 SAT score and No. 5 rank in a class of more than 800. \"Only one Ivy. Rejected almost everywhere else, save a few (University of California campuses) and Carnegie. I'm not African American. Yes. Race matters.\"\n\nEnin says critics of the admissions process \"shouldn't look at it as 'you deserve to be in.' \" Ivy League colleges, he says, aren't necessarily looking for \"the elite of the elite.\" Rather, he says, the decision often turns on whether a candidate is a good fit. \"Statistics, of course, get you into the door … but they're picking people they feel will fit their class best,\" he says. \"It's not all numbers — it's the person behind the application.\"\n\nPerhaps sensing, even at age 17, that first impressions don't always work out, Enin says he's not ruling out transferring to one of the other seven. \"I feel that Yale fits me the best right now in my life, but where the future takes me I don't know,\" he says. \"They're great schools, all of them.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/08/18/taylor-swift-college-course/70601659007/", "title": "Taylor Swift college courses offered at growing list of universities", "text": "\"They wouldn’t teach you that in prep school so it’s up to me.\"\n\nThese \"Better than Revenge\" lyrics capture something higher education has picked up on: Taylor Swift songs are their own school of life. The singer-songwriter's ballads are valuable academic tools, especially in an era of evermore online students catching up from years of virtual learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Alexandra Wormley, a PhD student at Arizona State University's department of psychology.\n\n\"We can start to reimagine what classrooms are supposed to look like,\" said Wormley, who will be teaching \"Pscyhology of Taylor Swift\" this fall.\n\nAfter seeing Swift's Eras Tour opening night in Glendale, Arizona, this year, Wormley was sitting in her office with students chatting about the show. They started brainstorming what a psychology class that also talked about Swift would be like.\n\n\"We wrote up the syllabus that day,\" she said. \"We went through a different album of hers and talked about related psychology topics.\"\n\nNow the class has a waitlist for the fall semester. The course joins a series of Swiftie courses ranging from literature to social psychology at schools like Ghent University in Belgium, University of Texas at Austin, New York University, Stanford. All of these universities have offered or are currently offering a course focused on Swift’s lyrics, discography, as well as her potential impact.\n\nThe phenomena of higher education professors offering pop culture-based courses has existed: How to build a TikTok brand at Duke University mixed FYP with business savvy; #MeToo populated syllabi at Harvard University following the rise of the hashtag in 2017; Georgia students dove into Kendrick Lamar to understand social issues writing; “Beyoncé Feminism, Rihanna Womanism\" at UT Austin discussed the origins of Black feminism and myriad \"Harry Potter\"-themed offerings have offered opportunities in film critique.\n\nThose Taylor Swift figurinesfor sale online aren't from Funko, but fans will pay $250 anyway\n\nBut the proliferation of Swiftie courses begs the question why her music is having an academic moment.\n\nEducators know she's hugely popular right now. Swift's mega Era's Tour has garnered millions of dollars and hearts this summer, treating fans across the nation (and soon around the world) to an intimate show that feels more like friendship hug than fan event. Even those who didn't attend the shows felt Swift's effect. And she hints at no sign of slowing down. With her announcement of \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" coming this October, people are paying attention to Swift and her community, maybe making it just a little easier to pay attention in class.\n\nClass engagement is a big motivator, Wormley said. Gen Z students currently in higher education lost valuable years of high school and college to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, enrollment in colleges and universities among young people is tenuous: A 2022 report by the ECMC Group found that more than half of teens are open to something other than four-year college and 2023 data showed they want to challenge how typical four-year programs are designed.\n\nWormley said these trends have left higher education instructors with a creative assignment: How do they help students catch up academically and socially, while showing them their degrees have real-world value?\n\nSwift's writing helps students make person connections and prompts deeper discussions, said Elly McCausland, assistant professor of English literature at Ghent University. Her course \"Literature: Taylor's Version\" will be held this fall and intends to make the \"archaic\" language of Chaucer, Shakespeare and other canonical writers more understandable to her students, many of whom do not speak English as a first language.\n\n\"If I can provide a way into those texts, that might support them through that kind of alienation, then that's really important to me,\" she said.\n\nSwift studies are not about dumbing down the academics, proponents say, but elevating something popular.\n\n\"These students are not showing up for a three hour Taylor Swift fan club,\" Wormley said. \"This generation of students has been through so much. And if this is what it takes to get them back in the classroom and get them engaged, then I'm so happy to do this with them.\"\n\nWormley is most excited for week three of her class, which will focus on \"Fearless,\" Swift's album about her roots. The record's discussion about growing up, first love and nostalgia for childhood freedom will be a venue for students to learn about social development theories.\n\n\"I think it's especially relevant for these students because they're leaving that period of adolescence,\" she said.\n\nThe \"Fearless\" lesson will discuss family, friendship and new romance in the context of research by Seanna Leath, a professor at Washington University at St. Louis who studies experiences of Black women and girls.\n\nSwift's whiteness is worth addressing in these classes, said McCausland, especially when fields like literature are already so dominated by white creators. She's going to use \"Betty,\" \"August\" and \"Cardigan\" from the \"Folklore\" album as a way to teach the technique of \"writing back,\" a method to tell the untold side of a story the audience has already heard.\n\n\"[These three songs] invoke questions of language, power and voice and authority,\" she said. \"Whoever has the language and has the voice has the power. We're using Taylor's songs as a springboard to explore that.\"\n\nIt was Wormley's intention to include work by underrepresented voices in her syllabus, not only to introduce students to diverse academic rockstars but to legitimize that they, too, can find their voice in the field of psychology, she said.\n\n\"Part of it is building a classroom environment where students feel comfortable bringing themselves and their background to the space and being like, 'Hey, maybe this is what the academic literature says growing up is like but in my community and my culture, it's actually really different,'\" she said. \"We're all going to interpret these lyrics different and we're all going to attend to different things … I like to think Taylor would be totally into this.\"\n\nMore:Swifties called announcement of '1989 (Taylor’s Version)' and say they can guess her next three releases\n\nTaylor Swift's Eras Tour book looks:See the beautiful book covers that scream Swift", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/mitch-albom/2019/10/27/mitch-albom-halloween/2469669001/", "title": "Mitch Albom: Inoffensive Halloween costume? Good luck with that", "text": "Detroit Free Press\n\nThis happened every Halloween when I was a kid. The doorbell would ring, usually at night, when my siblings and I were already home from our candy walks. We’d open the door, all excited, and some teenager would be standing on the porch in jeans and a sweatshirt.\n\n“Trick or treat,” he’d mumble.\n\nWe’d give him candy, but our faces reflected our disappointment.\n\n“He didn’t even try to dress up!” we’d whisper when he left. Such lack of effort, we decided, was hardly worthy of a Milky Way bar, let alone a full pack of Necco Wafers.\n\nToday, however, things have changed. Today, if that kid rang my doorbell, I’d have to give him double candy, an approving nod, and a pat on the back for being so forward-thinking.\n\nThat’s because, thanks to our hyped-up, politically overcorrect, point-fingers-and-yell society, there is almost no Halloween costume you can wear without offending somebody, being ridiculed on the internet, perhaps even losing your job.\n\nYou might as well go in street clothes.\n\nDon’t believe me? Go online. Articles that used to pop up every October about “Great Costume Ideas for Halloween” have been replaced by articles entitled, “The 10 Most Offensive Halloween Costumes for 2019.” There are warnings, scoldings, everything but whirring sirens to prevent you from donning an outfit that someone on the planet might not like.\n\nIt’s enough to keep you home, eating tofu.\n\nDressing as anything is taboo\n\nIn case you’ve been out of the Halloween loop for a while, allow me to sum up the lists of costumes the experts agree you should NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT WEARING.\n\nA handful are obvious. Holocaust victim. Mass-shooting victim. Vladimir Putin. A terrorist. The World Trade Center towers on fire.\n\nOthers are a mark of the times. Harvey Weinstein. Matt Lauer. Any of Kevin Spacey’s characters. It is probably not a good idea to go as President Trump, as half the houses will refuse to give you candy, or Nancy Pelosi, as the other half will slam the door. Joe Biden is off limits (and no false teeth, please). Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a no-no, unless you are, actually, in fact, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nDressing as anything you are not is taboo. If you’re white, you can’t dress like an African American. If you’re African American, you can’t dress like you’re Indian. If you’re Indian, don’t pretend to be Latin-American. If you’re Latin-American, don’t dress as a Middle Easterner.\n\nDon’t dress Catholic. Don’t dress Jewish. Don’t dress Muslim. A nun? Are you kidding? A rabbi? Even worse. A Hindu priest? Who are you to dress like a Hindu priest? Unless, of course, you are actually a Hindu priest. And even then, it’s probably off limits.\n\nThe Royal Family? Not cute. Haven’t you heard how Harry and Meghan are suffering? The Queen? That’s ageism. Prime Minister Boris Johnson? Hey. Brexit is serious. Besides, with that hair, people would just think you were Trump.\n\nDon’t use childhood as a guide. Pretty much everything we wore as kids is on the no-no list. Cowboys? They destroyed life for Native Americans. Indians? Already covered that. Hobo? Are you kidding? Here's a tip on hobo costumes from Good Housekeeping last week: “In reality, homelessness is a devastating circumstance that affects millions, including kids. There are so many other (better) costumes you can choose!”\n\nYeah, like Moana from the Disney movie! Oops. That’s a cultural stereotype. So is a Mexican mariachi singer, the Sheik of Araby, Princess Jasmine, anyone from “Mulan,” a kimono, a samurai outfit, or Kim Jong Un.\n\nAnd don’t even think about a pillow around your midsection. Weight issues are dynamite.\n\nNothing is safe\n\nHow Halloween devolved to this point is a mystery. After all, it’s a pagan holiday that used to involve devilish images. Now you can’t even dress like an angel, for fear of offending atheists.\n\nThe issues seemed to swell in recent years, as a few high-profile firestorms made everyone skittish. Singer Chris Brown got in trouble for dressing as Osama Bin Laden. Actress Hilary Duff drew ire for dressing as a sexy pilgrim. Heidi Klum was ridiculed for a blue-skinned portrayal of a Hindu goddess of destruction.\n\nThen came the Yale University mess of 2015. An associate master of Yale’s Silliman college named Erika Christakis dared to wonder if warning college students about offensive Halloween costumes wasn’t going a bit too far in protecting them from anything that might prove the least bit uncomfortable.\n\nWell. You’d have thought she’d locked the kids in the attic. She and her husband — who defended her email — were harassed, lambasted, and so fully shouted down by certain students that they both wound up resigning. Students actually demanded advance warning of when Christakis would be coming to the dining hall, so they wouldn’t have to be disturbed by the sight of her.\n\nAnd all this didn’t even involve an actual offensive costume — just the mere idea of one!\n\nSince then, all bets are off. Not only are all the costumes already listed offensive, but now entire categories are dress-at-your-own-risk.\n\nSexy used to be good. Not anymore. That French maid outfit? The short-skirted nurse? The Chippendales chaps? Wear those and you’re objectifying humans.\n\nAnd you probably can’t dress like a whale or an eagle, because there’s nothing cute about being an endangered species.\n\nZombies and death are not to be trifled with. Soldiers will certainly offend anti-war folks. You can’t dress as certain founding fathers, without someone objecting to their slave ownership.\n\nIt’s enough to make you want to go naked. But that will only land you in jail.\n\nSo good luck finding anything safe. That kid who knocked on our door in jeans and a sweatshirt was ahead of his time.\n\nI’m reminded of an episode of “The Office” in which Jim, who does not like the whole Halloween thing, comes to work one year in his regular shirt and tie. When others complain that he’s not wearing a costume, he says, oh yes he is. He points to a name tag that says “Dave.”\n\nThat’s probably the extent of a safe Halloween costume today. But I’d bring along a Sharpie just in case. You never know when Dave might have offended.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

Before his presidency, Hoover graduated from Stanford and witnessed the Boxer Rebellion in China. He served a single term as president from 1929 to 1933.\n\nOtto Frederick Rohwedder\n\nBorn: Davenport\n\nLifetime: 1880-1960\n\nWhat he's known for: The commercial bread-slicing machine\n\nIt would be inaccurate to say Otto Frederick Rohwedder invented the best thing since sliced bread since, well, Rohwedder effectively did invent sliced bread.

Roosevelt\n\nBorn in Sioux City and a 1912 graduate of Grinnell College, Hopkins grew up to work on remedying the ripple effects of the Great Depression and become an advisor to Franklin D. Roosevelt. After Roosevelt became president in 1933, he named Hopkins the administrator of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and, when the United States entered World War II, Hopkins became a key figure in the efforts of the Allied powers. After surviving stomach cancer, Hopkins died due to liver failure months after receiving the Distinguished Service Medal from President Harry S.

Here's what to do | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAre you burned out?\n\nIf these three symptoms apply to you – a total lack of energy, a decline in your sense of belonging and a plummeting self-esteem – you could be a victim of burnout, experts say.\n\nBurnout can impact your ability to pay attention and retain memories, according to experts. Adobe Stock\n\nAfter two years of living in a simmering pool of pandemic stress, you could feel stretched to the max. Stay in that state long enough – or at a level of intensity such as that facing doctors and nurses working with the dying in Covid-19 wards – and it may even change your brain.\n\n“You notice things like being more irritable, more destructive, less motivated, less hopeful,” said Amy Arnsten, a professor of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicinewho studies the neural mechanisms of burnout.\n\nUnderstanding how your brain reacts to burnout can be helpful, as it shows people many of their reactions are part of a “natural phenomenon,” Arnsten said.\n\n“I am not a bad person – this is just how the brain changes with chronic stress. It’s doing it to try to protect me, even though in this situation, it’s making it worse,” she said.\n\n“Having that kind of insight and perspective can break the vicious cycle where you’re blaming yourself for not being better.”\n\nYour brain on burnout\n\nChronic stress has long been known to contribute to mental and physical diseases, and now researchers are able to capture what happens to the brain.\n\n“One of the most striking (effects) is thinning of the gray matter of an area of the brain called the prefrontal cortex,” Arnsten said. “It helps us to act appropriately. It gives us insight about ourselves and others. It gives us perspective. It allows us to do complex decision-makingand tobe able to have thoughtful, abstract reasoning rather than concrete or habitual responses.”\n\nBy weakening that area, experts say burnout can impact our ability to pay attention and retain memories, making it harder to learn new things and increasing the risk for mistakes.\n\nThat’s not all. Burnout can enlarge the amygdala, which is the part of the brain responsible for our “fight-or-flight” response when in danger, researchers have discovered.\n\n“It’s a double whammy. At the same time the prefrontal cortex is getting weaker and more primitive, the brain circuits that generate emotion like fear are getting stronger,” Arnsten said. “You start seeing the world as harmful even when it’s not.”\n\nCan you reverse these changes in the brain once they occur? Studies in mice show it’s possible, and a 2018 study in people found cognitive behavioral therapy for burnout reduced the size of the amygdala and returned the prefrontal cortex to pre-stress levels.\n\nResearch in people also shows we can keep the damage from occurring in the first place – if we feel we are in charge.\n\n“If you feel like you’re in control of the stressor, then there aren’t these toxic brain changes,” Arnsten said. “If you feel out of control it leads to chemical changes in the prefrontal cortex that weakens the connections, and over time actually erode those connections away.”\n\nWhat is burnout?\n\nBurnout presents with three major symptoms that can intertwine in unique ways for each person, experts say.\n\n“One of them gets most of the attention. It’s exhaustion,” said Kira Schabram, an assistant professor of management in the Foster School of Business at the University of Washington.\n\n“You wake up in the morning and you say, ‘How am I going to get out of bed and go to work?’”\n\nMany employers attempt to fix workplace burnout by offering employees time off to rest and rejuvenate. While that’s absolutely necessary for recovery, Schabram said, it may not be enough.\n\n“The problem is there’s two other dimensions,” she said. “Inefficacy, or feeling like you’re not really accomplishing things anymore, and cynicism, or a sense of alienation, either from the work itself or from other people.”\n\nSending employees home to rest without giving them tools to address the other two symptoms may be ineffective, Arnsten said\n\n“The problem is cynicism as a sense of alienation,” she said. “Now I’m sending you home. You’re spending even less time feeling like you’re connecting to your patients or your coworkers. So that’s where it gets tricky.”\n\nYou are resilient\n\nThe good news is that studies show you can recover from burnout, experts say. First, give yourself grace.\n\n“If it’s exhaustion, give yourself permission to engage in self-care, right? Take a nap. Take a day off. Call in sick,” Schabram said.\n\nTry to do healthy activities as part of that self-care, such as “trying to get to sleep and eatinghealthyfoods not high in sugar,” Arnsten said.\n\n“Alcohol is what people often reach for to relieve the stress, but it actually makes you feel worse the next day … and the same thing with benzodiazepines like Valium. But the healthier physiological activities (like) exercising and meditation that give you perspective can be really helpful,” Arnsten said.\n\nWhen it comes to addressing the sense of alienation that comes with burnout, Schabram said the solution may seem counterintuitive.\n\n“What we find is having compassion towards others helps restore that sense of belonging,” she said. “Become someone’s mentor. Start volunteering. What we find is that those acts of doing something kind for someone else really pulls you out of that sense of alienation.”\n\nAnd don’t forget to be compassionate to yourself, Schabram added: “We found both other-compassion and self-compassion help with burnout.”\n\nSelf-care and doing for others can also help with feelings of self-worth, by boosting your sense of accomplishment: “I took a cooking class or I picked up yoga for myself or I mentored someone else,” Schabram said.\n\nAnd studies show those activities don’t need to be massive or time-consuming to reduce feelings of burnout, she added.\n\n“Even really small gestures had an effect the next day,” she said. “Giving someone a compliment, taking them out for a five-minute walk to get a coffee, we see that that pushes the dial on next day burnout.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/arts/2017/02/09/physics-piano-consult-sean-chen/97570266/", "title": "The physics of piano? Consult Sean Chen", "text": "Richard Carter\n\nSpecial to the Times Record News\n\nWhen pianist Sean Chen was getting ready to graduate from high school near Los Angeles, he had college acceptance letters from Harvard, MIT and Juilliard.\n\n“If I had gone to Harvard or MIT, I’m sure I would have gone into the sciences,\" Chen said. “I was interested in anything math, physics or chemistry, really, or I many have discovered something else. When I chose Juilliard to do music, my reasoning was that if after two years I hated it, I think it would have been much easier to transfer out of it to study physics than the other way around.”\n\nChen, the 2013 Cliburn Crystal Award-winning pianist, will perform at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 18 with the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra at Memorial Auditorium. The orchestra will be conducted by Fouad Fakhouri, the third finalist for the position of WFSO conductor.\n\nChen said he was born into a family that liked music, but no one in his family was a professional musician.\n\n“My dad listened to a lot of ’70s rock and pop, and there was always music playing in our house.”\n\nHe began piano lessons at age 5 after his parents noticed him enjoying playing a little electronic keyboard.\n\n“So I started lessons. When you’re a kid, you start taking lessons and then you slowly start getting into (classical) music and finding the different composers you like.”\n\nAt Juilliard, Chen also took nonmusical courses at Columbia University, such as the complete calculus series, financial economics and econometrics.\n\n“I enjoyed computer programming, and there was a point in time when my teachers recommended me to apply for an internship doing computer graphics.”\n\nChen almost took the internship because it's easy to have fears about making a career in music. But he decided against it after a series of musical opportunities arose for him.\n\n“I am glad I stuck with it,” he said.\n\nThe pianist completed his bachelor's and master's degrees in music from Juilliard. In 2013, he placed third in the 14th Van Cliburn International Piano Competition. So rather than go for a doctorate in music and become a teacher, he completed his artist diploma at the Yale School of Music in 2014 to focus on performance.\n\nDoing well at such a major competition provided the pianist with support and management.\n\n“There are plenty of brilliant pianists out there,” he said. “The trick is getting support. Without that, I would not be performing as much as I do now.”\n\nThe 28-year-old Chen has played all over America, as well as a handful of concerts in Europe and China.\n\nChen will perform Sergei Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Op. 18, in C minor with the orchestra. After an intermission, the orchestra will perform Antonin Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, Op. 95 in E minor.\n\n“The Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto is just one of those pieces you know,” he said. “It’s like Grieg and Tchaikovsky and a couple of Beethoven and Mozart concertos. Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto has some of the best-known melodies of any classical piece.”\n\nPop singer Eric Carmen famously borrowed from the piece’s second movement in his hit single, “All by Myself.”\n\n“When Rachmaninoff wrote the concerto, he was coming out of this very depressive state of his life. This concerto is sort of his recovery piece he wrote to get back on track. It’s very dramatic. There are some very fun-to-play passages, and people really like it.”\n\nChen is frequently praised for his ability to communicate music to audiences. Part of that, he explained, is having a very good concept of the music in his head and then knowing what he wants to communicate. “It’s not a matter of playing the music because it’s been played this way for a long time.\n\nHis ongoing interest in math and science actually helps him communicate what he hears to the audience\n\n“Just because you feel something when you’re on stage doesn’t mean the audience is going to feel it. You have to, in a way, dissect and pinpoint the essence of the expression.\n\n“What makes it feel sad or lyrical or agitated or excited? You have to distill those into executable parameters or else you’ll end up spending a lot more time feeling things than actually have them come out.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Pianist Sean Chen with the Wichita Falls Symphony Orchestra\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Feb. 18\n\nWhere: Memorial Auditorium, 1300 Seventh St.\n\nAdmission: $10 to $35\n\nInformation: wfso.org or 940-723-6202", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/09"}]}

This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, a look at some of Trump's latest cabinet picks plus what Trump's promises about pardoning January 6th insurrectionists might mean for the future of the far right movement. And we take a look at what's next for several major issues circling the Supreme Court.\n\n♦\n\nPresident-elect. Donald Trump continues to build his next administration, tapping trusted allies to serve as advisors and cabinet members. In one of his latest moves Trump announced he's nominating former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee as his U.S. ambassador to Israel. Huckabee is a Baptist minister and former Fox News host who has run for the Republican presidential nomination twice, unsuccessfully. Senator Marco Rubio is expected to be named the next secretary of state according to the New York Times and CNN. Rubio is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and was a finalist to be Trump's running mate. He would be the first Latino to serve in the position.\n\n♦\n\nMeanwhile, Trump said yesterday, he's tapped tech billionaire, Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person and former Republican presidential contender, Vivek Ramaswamy, to lead a new department of government efficiency that will work to slash federal government spending, waste and regulations. In other roles, Trump has appointed Tom Homan to oversee deportation policy and aviation security. Homan was a border patrol agent for 34 years and served in Trump's first administration as acting ice director. He drew controversy for strict immigration enforcement, including the zero tolerance policy which separated families of undocumented immigrants. And Trump has appointed Lee Zeldin as the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA. Trump today will make his first visit to Capitol Hill since winning the White House, for a meeting with congressional GOP leaders and he's expected to meet with President Joe Biden. For more on Trump's preparations for another term, check out a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nDonald Trump has promised to pardon January 6th insurrectionists and experts say that would send a strong signal of support to America's far right movement. I spoke with USA TODAY national correspondent Will Carless for more. Will, thanks for making some time on this.\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThanks for having me on.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Will, let's just put this kind of in context before we get to the Trump part of this. How many people have been convicted and jailed for their actions on or related to January 6th, 2021? What have we seen in recent years?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nSo the number of people charged is over 1500 at this point, a lot of which have made plea deals or been convicted. A handful have been acquitted, but the final figure that I got from George Washington University was 663 people who have been jailed for January 6th, and there are still, as of today, 200 sitting in federal prisons. And that doesn't count people who have been sentenced to prison but haven't yet been assigned a facility or actually shown up for their sentence.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWow. Okay. So what has President-elect Donald Trump then said about pardoning some of these folks?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nWell, his rhetoric has become stronger and stronger in this regard. He's done his Trump thing where he'll sort of take it on and respond to questions, but never quite fully answer the question. So, for example, he was asked in August at a conference of black journalists whether he would pardon the January 6th rioters and he said, \"Absolutely I would.\" And then he sort of added, \"If they're innocent, I would pardon them.\" We of course, asked the Trump campaign, I've asked them twice, to sent them pretty detailed questions about who would be pardoned and why, and they've sent me back the same one sentence response in both cases, which simply says that \"President Trump will make decisions on a case-by-case basis.\" So not quite clear. I mean a lot of people think that he might be pressured into pardoning all the January 6th rioters. He may only do a handful, he may not do any, but he's certainly edging towards pardoning more rather than fewer, I would say.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. Well, will we know Trump rhetoric and action can be two different things. I mean, do we expect this as a reality during his administration? Can he do what he's claimed here? I mean, what do the legal experts say on this?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nWell, I'll put my analyst hat on for a second, but I think in this case I will sort of conglomerate what I've been told by people I've been talking to, and nobody's quite sure, but people do agree that he is in a pretty sticky situation if he chooses not to pardon anybody. Remember that Trump himself has spent the last, really four years, trying to rewrite history when it comes to January 6th, along with a slew of conservative talk show hosts and news anchors and influencers who have tried to pretend that January 6th was this sort of peaceful meeting of the minds and this protest that has been unjustly prosecuted by a biased FBI. As somebody who was there that day, I can tell you that's complete nonsense. You can watch the videos for yourselves. More than 150 police officers were injured. But nevertheless, that is the line. That is the story that Trump and others have spun up around the January 6th insurrection.\n\nAnd so if you follow that to its logical conclusion, here's a man who has power to pardon these people. His claim has been that they've done nothing wrong and that they've been impacted by an unfair judicial system and legal system. It stands to reason that he would follow through and say, right, we're going to let these people out. But as one of the people I talked to, Rachel Carroll Rivas, who heads the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out, there's a big difference between what politicians say on the campaign trail and what they actually enact once they get into power. And so it's possible that more moderate voices get to Trump and he decides not to do this. If he does pardon them then, as Rachel said, it really gives a strong indication as to how he plans to govern moving forwards if he lets all of these insurrectionists out of prison\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWill, if he were to undergo mass pardons in this way surrounding January 6th, what would this mean for the country's far right movements more broadly?\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThat's the real gist of my story, is that this is a movement that has had a lot of the oxygen sucked out of it over the last two or three or four years. Really, January 6th was a serious reckoning for America's far right extremist movement. You saw leaders from the movement, the really big powerful leaders, put in prison, a lot of them. And you saw what I like to refer to as the brands of the far right, particularly the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys. You saw those brands lose a lot of their cachet and a lot of their power in the months and the years after January 6th and the prosecutions. And you also saw the far right in general really center a warning shot. Look, if you come out in public and you behave badly and you break laws, then the Justice Department will come after you federally and you will go to prison.\n\nSo a pardon or a series of pardons and sliding scale as to how big those pardons are and how many there are, would have many people think a corollary effect on that movement. It will send a message to America's far right that look, whatever you do, whether it's right down to seditious conspiracy and you're sent to prison for 22 years, it can be pardoned and we're okay with it and we are sending a message that we are supportive of that sort of action. And that is of serious concern to scholars and to watchers of America's far right, that they could be really emboldened by these pardons\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWill Carless covers extremism and emerging issues for USA TODAY. Thank you Will.\n\nWill Carless:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA New York Court has suspended all current deadlines in Trump's New York hush money case, including a scheduled November 26th sentencing on his 34 felony convictions. Judge Juan Merchan was scheduled to issue a decision yesterday on whether the Supreme Court's broad presidential immunity ruling means Trump's felony convictions must be tossed out. But the pause on the case until November 19th, which was made public yesterday, means that ruling will not come this week. It's unclear what the new decision to pause the current deadlines means for whether Trump will ever be sentenced. Merchan ordered prosecutors to provide an update on their views of how to proceed in the case in light of Trump's presidential election victory.\n\n♦\n\nA new Trump administration could change course on a number of Supreme Court cases. I spoke with USA TODAY's Supreme Court correspondent, Maureen Groppe, to break them down. Hello, Maureen.\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nHello, how are you?\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood. Good. Thanks for hopping back on The Excerpt today. So Maureen, we're beginning think about what a Trump win might mean for the Supreme Court and surrounding some key issues. Let's start with transgender care. What's the latest around some of these issues in the courts and how do we expect a new Trump term to influence them?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nWell, one of the most high profile cases the Supreme Court is considering this term is the constitutionality of measures that about half the states have taken to prevent transgender minors from receiving puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The Biden administration challenged Tennessee's ban and the Supreme Court is set to hear all oral arguments in that case next month, but it could be months after that, before the Supreme Court issues its opinion. And before they do, the Trump administration could tell the court that the Justice Department has changed positions. That would be unusual to happen after the case has been argued. But Trump made opposition to transgender rights a central theme to his campaign so we'll have to see what he wants to do about this.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMaureen, we know the issue of abortion has become a major debate across the country. It could be headed back to the justices. What's the expectation here?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nOne abortion issue that could come back to the court is the Biden administration's challenge to Idaho's strict abortion ban. The administration says that that ban conflicts with a federal law that requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care, which includes abortions if those are needed to prevent serious health consequences. This issue came before the Supreme Court earlier this year, but the justices sent it back to the Appeals Court for further review. And if the Appeals Court sides with the Biden administration, the Trump administration could just drop the challenge if Idaho appeals that decision to the Supreme Court\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd as the country continues to grapple with gun violence, so-called ghost guns have been at the center of a lot of debates. What's next here, Maureen and what might be the Trump administration's influence?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nSo the ghost guns are weapons that are put together from kits that don't have serial numbers. And people who buy the kits don't have to pass background checks, or at least they didn't have to do that the way they do with the fully manufactured gun until the Biden administration changed that. The Supreme Court heard a challenge to those regulations last month. And this case is not about the Second Amendment, but whether the administration correctly applied existing law to regulate these weapons. And it actually sounded like the justices might be willing to uphold the rules, but even if they do, the Trump administration could just repeal the rules once Trump takes office. We don't know if he's going to do that or not. The gun rights groups are expecting him to do that based on promises that they say that he made to them about undoing various gun regulations. But we don't know for sure what the Trump administration will do.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAs you outline in this piece, Maureen, we've already seen this kind of whiplash in the courts across the last few administrations from Trump to Biden. Now we're going back to Trump. How has this played out and what might this tell us about the next four years?\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThis change of positions doesn't happen on every case, but it can happen on some big ones. And the last time Trump was president, his Justice Department reversed positions on several issues and they still won those cases. The Biden administration did some of its own reversals when it took office. What we don't know is how much these switching positions matter. In other words, do the justices take them into account when they're deciding a case or would they make the same decision regardless? That's something we can't peek behind the curtain to know.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Maureen Groppe covers the Supreme Court for USA TODAY. Thank you, Maureen.\n\nMaureen Groppe:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nA Massachusetts Air National Guard member was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison for violating the Espionage Act by sharing hundreds of classified documents on social media. The security lapse led to punishment for 15 service members. Twenty-two-year-old Airman 1st Class Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty in March to six counts of willful retention of defense records for sharing classified documents through the social media platform Discord. The leak's exposed embarrassing secrets and analysis from across the U.S. intelligence community involving Russia's War in Ukraine and North Korea's race to develop nuclear weapons.\n\n♦\n\nWhile the U.S. is on the whole, a wealthy country, currently one in eight Americans is food insecure. Meanwhile, more than a third of food produced goes uneaten or unsold, and most of that ends up in landfills where it becomes a big contributor to climate change. Is there a way to solve these two problems together by simply using the food surplus to feed more people instead of sending it to landfills?

One of the boys pulls a BB gun out of his pocket, lays it on the ground and extends his arms out as if to show he has nothing in his hands, police said in the document.\n\nMyers pushes the boy the ground, straddles him and holds him in place as he points the gun at the 17-year-old, who is standing and brings both arms forward, showing that he has nothing in hands, the footage shows. The 17-year-old backs away, with his left hand in the air while his right arm \"briefly lowers to his waist area,\" police said in the document.\n\n\"Immediately after ... it is clear that he has been shot because he abruptly jerks his body away from Myers and falls to the ground,\" the document says.\n\nBased on the footage, the officer writing the document says there was probable cause to arrest Myers on a charge of second-degree murder without premeditation. Myers was arrested and taken to an interview room.\n\nThe 17-year-old shot and killed was identified as Hazrat Ali Rohani by Kent-Meridian High School Principal David Radford, according to the Kent Reporter.\n\nMyers cries in interview room, says he 'had a duty to act'\n\nWhen police read Myers his rights and began trying to interview him, he \"was distraught and crying,\" police said.\n\n\"He advised that he was going to 'be sick' and he was given a trash can, where he started to audibly gag a few times,\" police said, adding that they helped calm Myers down to explain why he shot the boy.\n\nMyers said that when he first saw the boys, he thought one of them had a \"Glock\" by his side and that they were about to commit an armed robbery.\n\n\"Myers felt like he did not have time to call 911, and that he had a duty to act to stop the individuals from hurting someone innocent, and to protect his son, who was in the location next door,\" according to the police report.\n\nMyers got out of his car and pointed his gun at the three teens, who were still walking toward the store. He said they ignored his repeated commands to put their hands up.\n\nHe said that he saw what he believed to be a gun in one of the teen's waistbands and saw the boy \"grab the handle of the gun,\" police wrote.\n\nMyers said he told the teen not to grab the gun but that the boy only \"grabbed the gun further.\" Myers said he believed that the teen was \"going to pull it out\" and \"was going to kill him.\" That's when the shooting happened.\n\nMyers' case has not made its way to the King County Superior Court and USA TODAY could not find a lawyer representing him. Phone numbers listed in the police report for Myers and his emergency contact rang unanswered Friday.\n\nTeens explain why they had BB guns\n\nThe two surviving teens told police that they were at the store to return or exchange Hazrat Ali Rohani's BB gun because he was having some issues with it, according to the police report. One of them also said that he had his own BB gun with him and brought it along so employees could check out a \"magazine issue\" he was having.\n\nBoth friends said they told Myers repeatedly that they were carrying BB guns and that before they knew it, their friend had been shot.\n\nRadford, Rohani's principal, wrote an email to parents and students that he was \"deeply saddened to inform you of another tragic passing of one of our students.\"\n\n“As some of you may have seen the news on Wednesday evening, June 5, Hazrat Ali Rohani was involved in an altercation in Renton, which tragically ended in loss of life,\" he said, according to the Kent Reporter. \"Our thoughts are with his friends and family during this sensitive time.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2022/10/19/ex-louisville-metro-police-detectives-curt-flynn-bryan-wilson-sentenced-slushy-drink-throwing-case/69525248007/", "title": "Ex-Louisville Metro Police detectives sentenced in drink throwing case", "text": "Two former Louisville Metro Police detectives were sentenced Wednesday to federal prison for throwing slushies and drinks from unmarked squad cars at residents in the West End. One of the detectives was also sentenced in an unrelated cyberstalking case.\n\nBryan Andrew Wilson and Curt Flynn appeared for sentencing after they both pleaded guilty in June to one count of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of pedestrians through arbitrary use of force, a felony. Wilson also pleaded guilty to cyberstalking charges after using data software made available to him while he was an officer to hack the Snapchat accounts of several women to steal explicit material and use it against them.\n\nFlynn was sentenced to three months in prison, while Wilson was given 30 months in prison for his charges. The pair were each also sentenced to three years of supervised release and 120 hours of community service.\n\nMore headlines:BETWEEN THE LINES: A Courier Journal investigation into literacy among Kentucky kids\n\nWilson and Flynn were detectives in the Ninth Mobile Division from August 2018 through September 2019 when they threw beverages, including the container, at people walking in the predominantly Black neighborhoods of the West End.\n\nThe two — joined by others who were not named by the U.S. Justice Department — threw the drinks while dressed in LMPD uniforms and riding in unmarked police vehicles. They would identify a target and then drive closer to the person before throwing the drinks after announcing on the police radio that \"someone was thirsty,\" or \"thirsty fam,\" according to federal prosecutors.\n\nAfter throwing the beverage, the driver of the LMPD vehicle would flee. On many occasions, people were hit with beverages, and in at least one instance, a person was knocked down after being hit, according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe assaults were recorded either by the detectives or others participating, \"sometimes from inside the car from which the beverage was thrown, and sometimes from an LMPD car following closely behind the car from which the beverage was thrown,\" the Justice Department said in a news release earlier this year.\n\nWilson would then show the videos to other members of LMPD's Ninth Mobile Division, a citywide violent crime unit that came under scrutiny amid lawsuits alleging it pulled over Black drivers for minor violations and searched them — with little to no evidence — for weapons and drugs.\n\n\"The conduct Bryan Wilson, Curt Flynn and others engaged in, while acting under color of law, was deliberative and malicious, and it shocked the conscience,\" federal prosecutors wrote in court documents.\n\nLMPD Chief Erika Shields said this year she would initiate an internal investigation to determine how much other officers knew about and how involved they were in drink-throwing incidents.\n\n\"I want to make it clear to everyone, the actions of former Detectives Flynn and Wilson are reprehensible, sickening, and do not reflect the core values of LMPD,\" Shields said in June. \"Their behavior was demoralizing and dehumanizing to the victims. On behalf of this agency, I wish to express my sincere apologies to those affected. This type of behavior will not be tolerated. We owe our community better and this is not representative of the good work the men and women of LMPD strive for every day.\"\n\nFlynn, 40, had faced up to 10 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $250,000 fine. Wilson, 36, had faced a combined maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a $500,000 fine on both charges.\n\nU.S. District Judge Benjamin Beaton chose to exceed the sentencing recommendations of federal prosecutors.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie M. Zimdahl noted that there were 40 leaked videos of drinks being thrown at pedestrians and indicated not all of the attacks were captured on camera.\n\nShe recommended Flynn receive three years of supervised probation, which Flynn's attorney, L. Scott Miller, also requested.\n\nFlynn \"served with distinction\" in the Air Force for about 20 years, including two tours of duty in Kyrgyzstan and Iraq, before joining the Air National Guard and then LMPD, Miller noted in court filings.\n\nFlynn's wife, Jade, also testified and wrote a letter describing the ex-detective as \"a devoted husband\" and father of three children.\n\nJudge Beaton, though, asked if probation would be recommended \"if the script flipped,\" and people without a badge and cruiser were engaging in attacks on uniformed officers for a year. Flynn's action, he said, corroded public trust.\n\nBefore receiving his sentence, Flynn addressed the courtroom, apologizing for his actions.\n\n\"I violated the trust of people I swore to protect,\" he said.\n\nBut, he continued \"these horrible incidents are things I did, not who I am. My entire life, I've dedicated to public service. ... I am asking for leniency and mercy.\"\n\nBased on the federal sentencing guidelines – which weighs several factors including the seriousness of the crime, the defendant’s criminal history and the defendant’s cooperation in the investigation – Flynn could have received 18 to 24 months in prison.\n\nThe drink-throwing incidents first became public in June 2021.\n\nShields said at the time that the officers had been reassigned to desk duty as the federal investigation was underway. The chief later said Flynn, who joined LMPD in 2010, resigned from the department after his guilty plea in federal court and that Wilson, who joined LMPD in 2011, had resigned in July 2020 due to a separate criminal investigation.\n\nWhile court documents only referred to victims as \"John Does and Jane Does,\" Jefferson Circuit Judge Jessica Green offered more context in 2021, when she was the Metro Council representative for the various West End neighborhoods included in District 1.\n\n\"I am very disturbed about the idea of narcotics detectives throwing snowcones on homeless Black people in West Louisville,\" Green previously said. \"I hope nobody makes excuses for that kind of behavior.\"\n\nUsing law enforcement access to cyberstalk\n\nWilson was sentenced just after Flynn, with his hearing including a statement from one of his victims.\n\nIn the separate case, Wilson admitted to stealing compromising photos and videos of women, then sending them text messages in which he threatened to publish them unless they sent more to him.\n\nU.S. Assistant Attorney David Weiser recommended Wilson be sentenced to 24 months.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Weiser said Wilson hacked the Snapchat accounts of 25 victims and had direct contact with eight. He published photos and videos of the explicit material \"on several occasions,\" Weiser said.\n\nIn one case, a woman almost lost her job after Wilson sent her boss explicit content of her, a court document states.\n\nOne victim, identified as Jane Doe, tearfully said in court that months of harassment put her in a constant state of fear. \"Bryan Wilson completely filled my life upside down,\" she said.\n\nAfter photos and videos were stolen from her phone, she said a screenshot of the video was posted online and the video was sent to a friend. Additionally, she would receive daily messages from Wilson calling her names, such as \"dirty slut.\" She said she feared losing her career and began thinking about harming herself.\n\nBefore being sentenced, Wilson apologized to the woman, saying, \"the damage I did to you and to other people words cannot fix.\" He referred to his actions as \"disrespectful\" and said that in 2018, \"I completely lost my ways and I took it out on other people I did not know.\"\n\nWilson was able to steal the women's photos by using the powerful data-combining software, Accurint – which he was given access to as a law enforcement officer while working for the department. The cyberstalking happened between September and October 2020, though he resigned from the department in June of that year due to the slushie-throwing investigation.\n\nLMPD said that it disabled his access after it became known it was still active and that procedures have been implemented to suspend others' access once they leave the department.\n\nLouisville police officers in court:These are the ex-LMPD officers charged by feds with unlawful force\n\nWhile the DOJ has conducted a wide-ranging \"pattern-or-practice\" investigation into LMPD, the federal government has also charged several other now-former officers with civil rights offenses related to the beating of a kneeling, unarmed protester and the shooting of pepperballs at the niece of David McAtee before police and National Guard members fatally shot the West End barbecue stand owner in June 2020.\n\nIn addition, the DOJ announced indictments in August against four ex-LMPD personnel accused of lying on the drug-related search warrant or firing bullets that went into a neighboring apartment during the raid at Breonna Taylor's home that killed the 26-year-old Black woman in March 2020.\n\nKelly Hanna Goodlett, one of the former detectives indicted in August who has pleaded guilty to helping falsify an affidavit used to search Taylor's apartment, had also been named, but not charged, in the federal investigation into Flynn and Wilson throwing drinks at residents.\n\nReporter Krista Johnson contributed to this story.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all.

Prosecutors had requested seven years and two months while Potter’s attorneys argued for a lesser sentence, pointing to her lack of a prior criminal history and remorse for Wright’s death.\n\nPotter will be required to serve two-thirds of her sentence in prison, or 16 months, according to state law. With good behavior, she will be eligible for supervised release for the remaining third.\n\nHennepin County Judge Regina Chu called the sentence “an extremely difficult decision.”\n\nIn justifying it, she pointed to several mitigating factors, saying it was undisputed that Potter never intended to use her gun. Chu told the court she took into account the four reasons for incarceration – retribution, incapacitation, deterrence and rehabilitation – saying retribution would be the only purpose served in Potter’s case.\n\n“There rightfully should be some accountability,” she said.\n\nBut Potter is a “cop who made a tragic mistake,” the judge added. “She drew her firearm thinking it was a Taser, and ended up killing a young man.”\n\nShe called this case “highly unusual,” noting two other cases involving police officers tried in that court.\n\n“The other officer cases tried in this court are distinguishable,” she said, alluding to the cases of Derek Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering George Floyd, and Mohamed Noor, who was convicted in the death of Justine Ruszczyk.\n\n“This is not a cop found guilty of murder for using his knee to pin down a person for nine and a half minutes as he gasped for air,” she said. “This is not a cop found guilty of manslaughter for intentionally drawing his firearm and shooting across his partner and killing an unarmed woman who approached his squad.”\n\nWright’s family was “completely stunned” by the sentence, their attorney Ben Crump said in a statement.\n\n“While there is a small sense of justice because she will serve nominal time, the family is also deeply disappointed there was not a greater level of accountability,” the statement said. “The Judge’s comments at sentencing showed a clear absence of compassion for the victim in this tragedy and were devastating to the family.”\n\nShortly before she was sentenced, Potter tearfully apologized to Wright’s family, saying, “I am so sorry that I brought the death of your son, father, brother, uncle, grandson, nephew, and the rest of your family,” adding, “I’m sorry I broke your heart.”\n\n“I do pray that one day you can find forgiveness,” the former officer said, “only because hatred is so destructive to all of us.”\n\nPotter also apologized to the city of Brooklyn Center, saying she loved working for the community and that those who still do are “good, honorable people.”\n\nPotter’s tears trumped justice, Wright’s mother says\n\nAfter Friday’s hearing, Wright’s mother told reporters her family was “very disappointed” with the sentence.\n\n“This is the problem with our justice system today. White women tears trumps justice,” Katie Wright said. She thought her own “White woman tears would be good enough,” she said, “because they’re true and genuine.”\n\nWright’s father similarly expressed his strong discontent with Potter’s sentence. “I feel cheated, I feel hurt,” he said.\n\n“They were so tied up into her feelings and what’s going on with her,” Arbuey Wright said, referring to Potter, “that they forgot about my son being killed.”\n\nEarlier Friday morning, Wright’s parents, two siblings and the mother of his child stood at a podium in court and urged the judge to impose the maximum possible sentence.Wright’s mother said Potter was a “police officer that took an oath to serve and protect for 26 years.”\n\n“But not on this day. On this day, she did not protect,” she said. “She failed Daunte, our family and our community.”\n\nChyna Whitaker, the mother of Wright’s son, Daunte Wright Jr., said in her own victim impact statement that Potter had taken away her son’s best friend.\n\nThe 2-year-old doesn’t fully understand his father’s absence but he senses it, she said. She sometimes finds her son staring at a poster of his father in his bedroom. And when shown photos or videos of Wright, the child smiles, she said, and says “Dada.”\n\n“My son shouldn’t have to wear a ‘rest in peace’ shirt of his dad,” Whitaker said, asking for the maximum sentence.\n\nPeople hold their phones up while protesting outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department on Friday, April 16.

The fence is adorned with car air fresheners symbolic to the shooting death of Daunte Wright. Moments before police fatally shot Wright during a traffic stop Sunday, he called his mother and told her he'd been pulled over for hanging air fresheners from his rearview mirror. Minnesota is one of at least several states with laws that prohibit hanging items from a vehicle's rearview mirror or affixing them to the windshield on the grounds that they could obstruct the driver's vision. Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon told reporters that Wright was originally pulled over for an expired tag and that when officers approached his car, they saw an item hanging from the rearview mirror. Officers ran Wright's name and found a gross misdemeanor warrant, Gannon said. John Minchillo/AP Demonstrators protect themselves with umbrellas against tear gas and pepper balls.

The maximum penalty for first-degree manslaughter predicated on reckless use/handling of a firearm is 15 years in prison and/or a $30,000 fine.\n\nHowever, under the state’s sentencing guidelines, a judge has discretion to sentence convicted offenders with no prior criminal history, like Potter, to between roughly six- and eight-and-a-half years in prison.\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison asked Chu to impose the presumptive sentence of 86 months in a sentencing memo filed Tuesday. That sentence, he wrote, would reflect the “seriousness of the loss of (Wright’s) life” as well as Potter’s “culpability” in causing Wright’s death.\n\nFriday was a “somber day,” Ellison said in a statement, but he accepted Chu’s decision, urging everyone to do the same.\n\n“I don’t ask you to agree with her decision, which takes nothing away from the truth of the jury’s verdict. I know it is hurtful to loved ones of Daunte Wright,” he said. “I ask that we remember the beauty of Daunte Wright, to keep his memory in our hearts, and to know that no number of years in prison could ever capture the wonder of this young man’s life.”\n\nThe attorney general hopes more can be done to prevent weapons confusion, he said, adding Potter could “make a powerful contribution.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Our family is hurting': Naisha Wright speaks on nephew's death 03:39 - Source: CNN\n\nOfficer said she mistook her gun for Taser\n\nWright’s shooting occurred as Chauvin stood trial in Minneapolis for murdering Floyd andprompted days of unrest in Brooklyn Center, reigniting demonstrations in a metropolitan area that has time and again found itself the epicenter of conversations about policing and use of force.\n\nWright was pulled over by police on April 11 for an expired tag and illegal air freshener, according to authorities. During the stop, police learned Wright had an outstanding warrant, and when Potter and a trainee officer attempted to arrest him, Wright tried to drive off.\n\nVideo of the incident shows Potter, a 26-year police veteran, repeatedly yell “Taser” before she shot Wright with her handgun.\n\n“Holy sh*t! I just shot him,” she said, per the video, adding, “I grabbed the wrong f**king gun, and I shot him.”\n\nPotter resigned from the police department days later.\n\nPotter’s trial focused on her fatal error: Prosecutors attributed it to Potter’s recklessness and negligence, while defense attorneys argued it was an honest, tragic mistake – but not a crime.\n\n“Accidents can still be crimes if they occur because of recklessness or culpable negligence,” Assistant Minnesota Attorney General Erin Eldrige said in her closing argument. “It’s not a defense to the crimes charged.”\n\nPotter’s attorney Earl Gray argued the former officer was within her rights to use deadly force to protect a fellow officer, who was reaching into the vehicle when Wright attempted to drive away.\n\nMore than 30 witnesses testified during eight days of testimony, including Potter, who broke down in tears as she described the shooting and the moments leading up to it, telling the court, “I didn’t want to hurt anybody.”\n\n“I was very distraught. I just shot somebody. I’m sorry it happened,” she said after a prosecutor asked about her behavior following the shooting. “I’m so sorry.”\n\nThe jury ultimately found Potter guilty after deliberating for about 27 hours.\n\nPotter has been incarcerated since her conviction at a correctional facility in Shakopee, about 25 miles southwest of Minneapolis, according to records from the Minnesota Department of Corrections.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Brad Parks Claudia Dominguez", "Dakin Andone", "Brad Parks", "Claudia Dominguez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/12/02/ny-prison-break-accomplices-son-faces-domestic-violence-charges/76691966/", "title": "N.Y. prison break accomplice's son faces domestic violence charges", "text": "Elizabeth Murray\n\nBurlington Free Press\n\nBURLINGTON, Vt. — The son of a seamstress who helped two inmates escape from a New York prison has been charged in Vermont following a recent domestic incident with his wife, court records show.\n\nTobey L. Mitchell, 22, of Shelburne pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of first-degree aggravated domestic assault, second-degree unlawful restraint and interfering with access to emergency services. Following his hearing in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington, Mitchell was released on conditions. He had posted the $5,000 bail set by a judge over the weekend.\n\nIn an interview with Shelburne police after his arrest, Mitchell said the relationship he has with his wife has been strained for at least six months after financial stresses, the arrest of his mother Joyce Mitchell, and after he lost a part-time job, an affidavit written by Officer Joshua Flore states. Tobey Mitchell works full-time as an aircraft mechanic with the Vermont Air National Guard's 158th Fighter Wing maintenance group.\n\nGuard spokesperson Capt. Dyana Allen said Wednesday that Mitchell has been enlisted with the Vermont Air National Guard for five years, and most recently deployed to Kadena, Japan, in June. Allen said the military body has received notification of Tobey Mitchell’s criminal charges.\n\n\"The Vermont National Guard takes all Law Enforcement matters seriously and we will allow the civilian courts to adjudicate this case,\" she wrote in a statement.\n\nObama mourns passing of Saudi king\n\nTobey Mitchell’s lawyer Ted Kenney warned against making an assumption of \"guilty by association\" between Tobey Mitchell and his mother.\n\n\"What happened with his mother was a terrible thing, and it certainly put him under stress and pressure, but he's not a bad young man,\" Kenney said. \"He's actually a good young man who is in a bad circumstance. I'm concerned that people would see the connection of his mother and think the family was a bunch of bad eggs.\"\n\nTobey Mitchell’s mother Joyce Mitchell worked as an instructor in the tailor shop of the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y. She pleaded guilty in September to charges related to the June escape of two prisoners, Richard Matt and David Sweat, and was sentenced to 2 ⅓ to seven years in prison.\n\nJoyce Mitchell admitted smuggling hacksaw blades and other tools to Matt and Sweat, convicted killers who lived in adjacent cells at the prison in Dannemora, near the Canadian border. Mitchell was supposed to pick up the prisoners in her vehicle after they escaped, but she suffered a panic attack and was taken to the hospital by her husband, Lyle Mitchell, who also worked at the prison.\n\nShelburne police were asked to respond to Vermont 116 in the town on the morning of Nov. 28 after Tobey Mitchell’s wife, Paige Mitchell, 22, waved down a vehicle and asked the driver to call for help. She was carrying the couple’s 1-year-old daughter, Flore’s affidavit states.\n\nObama mourns passing of Saudi king\n\nTobey Mitchell’s wife later told police that her husband had been drinking and was frustrated because their daughter was not sleeping well. When Paige Mitchell tried to leave the home to go on a planned trip to New York, she said her husband refused to let her leave with the car, the affidavit states. Tobey Mitchell then took her phone and refused to give it back, the woman said in a sworn statement.\n\nPaige Mitchell tried to grab her phone back from her husband, and he began to strangle her with both hands, she told police. At each attempt to grab the phone or leave the home, Tobey Mitchell pushed his wife to the ground, the affidavit states. Paige Mitchell then attempted to block the door so her husband would not leave the house since she thought he was too impaired to drive, Flore wrote.\n\n“Mrs. Mitchell told me she has been strangled by Mr. Mitchell four to five times over the past year and over the past several months,” Flore wrote in the affidavit. “This behavior has increased and seems to be occurring every two to three weeks.”\n\nPaige Mitchell left the home with her daughter after her husband drove away, she said. She soon saw her husband driving back toward the home, which is when she said she flagged down another driver for help, court papers state.\n\nFlore stated that he later noted redness on both sides of the woman’s neck.\n\nTobey Mitchell told police that he never strangled his wife, but he pushed her out of the way when she blocked the door. He said he had told his wife that she could not take the car since he pays for it, but he would call her father to come pick her up. He also said he took Paige Mitchell’s cellphone since he pays for it, according to court papers.\n\nObama mourns passing of Saudi king\n\n“Mr. Mitchell told me he did punch a hole in the wall at the residence,” Flore wrote.\n\nFlore said Tobey Mitchell had told his wife to take care of their crying child in an attempt to get the woman away from the door. She continued to block the door, Tobey Mitchell told Flore.\n\n“Mr. Mitchell told me he pushed Mrs. Mitchell out of the way several times and she had fallen when she was pushed,” Flore wrote in the affidavit. “Mr. Mitchell was asked if he could have pushed Mrs. Mitchell by her neck and he told me he could have. … Mr. Mitchell told me he never put two hands on her neck to push or strangle her.”\n\nTobey Mitchell’s conditions of release include that he have no contact with his wife while the case pends and that he not go near or into the couple’s residence except once with law enforcement to collect belongings.\n\nHis lawyer Kenney said he was confident that the case would be decided in his client's favor in the end.\n\n\"It's obvious the marriage was stressful, and we expect that when our day in court arrives, there will be a very different version of what happened that day,\" Kenney said.\n\nIf found guilty, Tobey Mitchell faces a sentence of up to 15 years in prison and fines up to $25,000 or both for the domestic assault charge, and lesser sentences for the other two charges.\n\nFollow Elizabeth Murray on Twitter at @LizMurraySMC", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/02"}]}

Twitter users vote in poll to expel ...", "text": "More than half of 17.5 million Twitter users who responded to a poll that asked whether Elon Musk should step down as head of the social media platform voted in favor of him doing so, according to results posted Monday morning.\n\nSome 57.5% of them voted \"Yes,\" while 42.5% voted \"No\" against Musk stepping down as chief of the micro-blogging platform after the billionaire launched the poll on his Twitter account Sunday.\n\nNeither Twitter or Musk immediately responded publicly about whether Musk would step down, but the Tesla and SpaceX CEO initially said that he would abide by the results.\n\nMeanwhile, scores of users appeared to be awaiting his response with baited breath.\n\n\"So…Bye?\" one user posted.\n\n\"Doesn't mean immediately right? Could be 3, 6, 9 months from now,\" another asked.\n\nThe move asking users for their opinion comes on the heels of Musk clashing with some users on multiple fronts, including him acknowledging he made a mistake in launching new speech restrictions that banned mentions of rival social media websites.\n\nIn yet another significant policy change, Twitter had announced that users will no longer be able to link to Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon and other platforms the company described as “prohibited.”\n\nThe decision generated so much immediate criticism, including from past defenders of Musk, that he promised not to make any more major policy changes without an online survey of users.\n\nThe action to block competitors was Musk's latest attempt to crack down on certain speech after he shut down a Twitter account last week that was tracking the flights of his private jet.\n\nBanned platforms included Facebook, Instagram, and newly created rivals Mastodon, Tribel, Nostr, Post and former President Donald Trump's Truth Social. Twitter gave no explanation for why the blacklist included those seven websites but not others such as Parler, TikTok or LinkedIn.\n\nWhat is Mastodon? What to know about the decentralized site some see as a Twitter alternative\n\nTikTok bans:Restrictions on the popular video app are spreading across the US\n\nTwitter had said it would at least temporarily suspend accounts that include the banned websites in their profile a practice so widespread it would have been difficult to enforce the restrictions on Twitter's millions of users around the world. Not only links but attempts to bypass the ban by spelling out “instagram dot com” could have led to a suspension, the company said.\n\nA test case was the prominent venture capitalist Paul Graham, who in the past has praised Musk but on Sunday told his 1.5 million Twitter followers that this was the “last straw” and to find him on Mastodon. His Twitter account was promptly suspended, and soon after restored as Musk promised to reverse the policy implemented just hours earlier.\n\nMusk said Twitter will still suspend some accounts according to the policy but “only when that account’s (asterisk)primary(asterisk) purpose is promotion of competitors.”\n\nTwitter previously took action to block links to Mastodon after its main Twitter account tweeted about the @ElonJet controversy last week.\n\nMastodon has grown rapidly in recent weeks as an alternative for Twitter users who are unhappy with Musk’s overhaul of Twitter since he bought the company for $44 billion in late October and began restoring accounts that ran afoul of the previous Twitter leadership's rules against hateful conduct and other harms.\n\nThat social network, which has gained more than 1 million new users since Oct. 27, now hosts 1.9 million monthly active users, according to the Mastodon website.\n\nIn comparison, Twitter had more than 237 million daily active users in the quarter ending June 30, the company said in July. Users were up 16.6% compared to a year ago.\n\n'Assassination coordinates'\n\nLast week, Musk banned the @ElonJet account then changed Twitter's rules to prohibit the sharing of another person’s current location without their consent. He then took aim at journalists who were writing about the jet-tracking account, which can still be found on other social media sites, claiming they were broadcasting “basically assassination coordinates.”\n\nHe also suspend accounts of voluminous journalists who cover Twitter including reporters working for CNN, The New York Times, and The Washington Post. Many of those accounts were restored following an online poll by Musk.\n\nOver the weekend, The Washington Post’s Taylor Lorenz became the latest journalist to be temporarily banned. She said she was suspended after posting a message on Twitter tagging Musk and requesting an interview.\n\nThe paper's executive editor, Sally Buzbeecalled it an “arbitrary suspension of another Post journalist” that further undermined Musk’s promise to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech.\n\nThe promise to let users decide his future role at Twitter through an unscientific online survey appeared to come out of nowhere Sunday, though Musk had also promised in November a reorganization was happening soon.\n\nMusk was questioned in court on Nov. 16 about how he splits his time among his companies. Musk had to testify in Delaware’s Court of Chancery over a shareholder’s challenge to Musk’s potentially $55 billion compensation plan as CEO of the electric car company.\n\nMusk said he never intended to be CEO of Tesla, and that he didn’t want to be chief executive of any other companies either, preferring to see himself as an engineer instead. Musk also said he expected an organizational restructuring of Twitter to be completed in the next week or so. It’s been more than a month since he said that.\n\nIn public banter with Twitter followers Sunday, Musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new CEO, saying that person “must like pain a lot” to run a company that “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy.”\n\n“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted.\n\nContributing: Associated Press writers Matt O'Brien and Brian P. D.

President-elect Joe Biden now holds the record for the most votes received by a presidential candidate, after getting more than 81 million.\n\nDespite losing dozens of lawsuits and the Electoral College's certification of Biden's win, President Donald Trump's campaign and others continue to promote falsehoods about the credibility and security of the election.\n\nA Dec. 21 Facebook post, which pulled a screenshot of a Twitter post, claimed Biden somehow received 22 million phantom votes. The post has over 1,200 shares, as of Dec. 30.\n\n\"Simple math: Trump got 74 million votes and there are only 133 million registered voters in the USA,\" the tweet claims. \"Even if everyone who's registered actually voted, there would only be 59 million votes left for Biden. So how the hell did Biden get 81 million votes? 22 million extra?\"\n\nThe Facebook user who made that particular post has not returned a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nAnother Facebook user made the same claim without pulling a screenshot from Twitter. USA TODAY has also reached out to this user for comment.\n\nAnd the Twitter account MSM Fact Checking posted a similar claim on Dec. 18, from which many viral Facebook posts stem.\n\nIn a follow-up tweet, the MSM Fact Checking Twitter account tries to show its math: \"Just to clarify there were 213,799,485 registered voters in 2020 of which conflicting sources say turnout was between 60% - 65%. I averaged it out at 62.5% which means just over 133,500,000 registered voters voted. 74,000,000 Trump + 81,000,000 Biden = 155,000,000.\"\n\nAnd then, \"Just for complete transparency, even at 65% turnout the total would be just over 138,000,000 voters resulting in over 155,000,000 votes. However you look at it, it doesn't add up.\"\n\nThe MSM Fact Checking account has its direct messaging turned off so it could not be reached for comment.\n\nFact check:After endorsing him, New York Post now pushes Trump to accept Biden's victory\n\nVoter registration and turnout totals\n\nThe post is correct in its accounting of Trump's vote totals. He received more than 74 million votes. The vote total for Biden, 81 million, also is correct, putting the overall total at more than 155 million votes cast.\n\nWhat the tweets get wrong is the number of voters. There are more than 234 million people eligible to vote in the U.S. Not all of those people are registered voters, however.\n\nIn its thread of tweets, the account MSM Fact Checking provided conflicting calculations without citing sources. The initial post claimed there were 133 million registered voters. In another tweet, it claimed there were 213 million registered voters with a voter turnout rate of 62.5%. All of these numbers are false.\n\nWe know, after weeks of counting, that there were roughly 159 million ballots cast in the presidential election. According to the Election Project, this accounts for 66.7% of the eligible voting population of 239 million Americans..\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau publishes voter registration totals for the nation; its 2020 numbers are not yet available.\n\nBut for example, in the 2016 presidential election, there were 157 million registered voters. Of those, 137.5 million voted. And there were 224 million American citizens age 18 or older. All figures are higher than the number in the claim regarding the 2020 election, when voter registration and turnout broke records.\n\nFact check:No, Joe Biden's brother-in-law does not own Dominion Voting Systems\n\nOur ruling: Partly false\n\nThe claim in the post is rated PARTLY FALSE. The tweet that appears in viral Facebook posts cites correct vote totals for Trump (74 million) and Biden (81 million). But it falsely reports the number of registered voters. More than 159 million registered voters cast ballots in the general election, out of 239 million eligible voters. So it is completely possible that Trump and Biden would post that many total votes.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

She told USA TODAY that her post was based on a few stories she found.\n\nThe claim found its way to Twitter this month. User @CarolynYoung64 posted a meme on Aug. 3 with a picture of DeJoy \"wearing\" a badge that reads \"Other98.\" Next to the picture is a statement about DeJoy's investments. The Other 98 is a progressive social media organization that creates meme content primarily for Facebook, according to its website.\n\n\"Trump's Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and his wife have between $30.1 million and $75.3 million in assets in U.S. Postal Service competitors and contractors,\" reads the meme's statement. \"The man Trump put in charge of OUR Postal Service has the most to gain from its destruction.\"\n\nThe tweet tagged House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.; and Reps. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.; and Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., with a request to \"Please subpoena & stop DeJoy NOW.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to Young for comment.\n\nChanges at the top of USPS\n\nLeadership of the Postal Service has been reshaped with mostly Trump appointees. Its board of governors appointed North Carolina businessman and Trump campaign donor Louis DeJoy to the helm after U.S. Postal Service career veteran Megan Brennan retired earlier this year.\n\nDeJoy began his new role in June during a time of financial hardship for the Postal Service. Postal officials told Congress in April that the service could run out of money by the end of September in part because of COVID-19, according to USA TODAY.\n\nThe claim about DeJoy's investments picked up speed amid reports that his restructuring of the Postal Service's priorities led to processing delays. Some view the changes as a political maneuver to undermine a projected ramp-up in voting by mail amid the COVID-19 pandemic, The Washington Post reported.\n\nHowever, this theory was partially debunked by USA TODAY. In a report, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews called it \"baseless and absurd,\" while Postal Service spokesperson Marti Johnson said the agency is \"fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process.\"\n\nFact check:Voters should request ballots 2 weeks early, but mail isn't intentionally slow\n\nTwo insiders also offered a different perspective on the Postal Service's capacity to deliver election ballots on time. David Williams, chief logistics and processing operations officer and executive vice president of the U.S. Postal Service and Thomas Marshall, general counsel and executive vice president, said the agency is well-prepared.\n\n\"Contrary to media accounts and other accusations, there have been no edicts to delay the mail or eliminate overtime,\" Marshall and Williams wrote in an opinion piece in USA TODAY on Aug. 12. \"Rather, we are ensuring that our operations run on time and on schedule, which will avoid unnecessary overtime and transportation costs. We are making these changes methodically and in ways designed to ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of America’s mail – including election mail.\"\n\nMarshall and Williams also warned election officials and voters to be mindful of the Postal Service's delivery standards.\n\nOpinion: U.S. Postal Service remains committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process\n\nHow is DeJoy tied to Trump?\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, DeJoy donated more than $440,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, the inaugural committee and the Republican National Committee, according to the Raleigh News & Observer.\n\nDeJoy is a \"longtime donor of Republican causes,\" according to The Washington Post. Federal Election Commission records showed more than $157,000 in donations to Republican candidates, committees and super PACS from the start of 2020 until May, when the Post published its report.\n\nThe Charlotte 2020 Host Committee nominated DeJoy as its national finance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention. A private convention will be held in Charlotte on Aug. 21-24, according to The Associated Press.\n\nPrior to leading USPS, DeJoy served as CEO and chairman of New Breed Logistics, a company based in High Point, North Carolina, that provided logistics support services to corporations like Verizon, Disney and Boeing. The company also had a 25-year working relationship with the U.S. Postal Service, supplying multiple mail processing facilities with logistics support, the Greensboro News & Record has reported.\n\nDeJoy sold New Breed Logistics to shipping company XPO Logistics in 2014 for $615 million, according to Business North Carolina. He served on the company's board until 2018, before becoming president of LDJ Global Strategies, a Greensboro real estate investment and consulting company, according to the News & Record.\n\nTrump nominated DeJoy's wife, Aldona Wos, as ambassador to Canada in February. She has served as the vice chair of President's Commission on White House Fellowships since 2017, according to a nominee report from the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. Wos was also ambassador to Estonia in the George W. Bush Administration in 2004, the New York Times reported. And she served as North Carolina's secretary of Health and Human Services from 2013-15, under Gov. Pat McCrory.\n\nDoes DeJoy really have investments in U.S. Postal Service competitors?\n\nThe Washington Post reported in June about a probe into DeJoy's selection as postmaster general. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., asked the Postal Service governing board to turn over communications with the White House about the interview process and DeJoy's ultimate appointment.\n\nSchumer also sought the board's assurance that DeJoy would relinquish any conflicting financial holdings.\n\n\"(DeJoy's) financial interests in companies that have business ties with the Postal Service, as well as his extensive campaign fundraising efforts, also raise concerns regarding whether and how legal prohibitions on his ethical conflicts of interest and partisan political activity as a federal employee will be addressed,\" Schumer wrote to Postal Service Board of Governors Chairman Robert Duncan in a letter.\n\nUSA TODAY confirmed DeJoy's assets and vested restricted stock units in the company are valued between $250,001-$500,000, according to Wos' nominee report.\n\nDeJoy is also listed as having received director fees and income from XPO Logistics, a U.S. Postal Service contractor, but an income amount is not provided.\n\nWos' assets from UPS Inc. and freight shipping company J.B. Hunt total between $116,003-$315,000. Her own assets from XPO Logistics are valued between $30 million-$75 million.\n\nTogether, DeJoy and Wos may claim up to a total $75,815,000 in assets from U.S. Postal Service competitors, according to government records.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Wos for comment.\n\nAs postmaster general, DeJoy had to file a report with the Office of Government Ethics within 30 days of his appointment and then annually, as well as file periodic public transaction reports for qualifying transactions. He is also required to divest from any assets presenting a conflict of interest with the agency's operations, according to an email from spokesman Dave Partenheimer.\n\n\"The Postal Service does not require the Postmaster General to divest any particular assets. Rather, the Postmaster General may be required to divest an asset if a conflict of interest arises, and the Postal Service determines that his participation in the matter is so crucial that he may not disqualify himself,\" Partenheimer told USA TODAY.\n\nA government ethics expert also told USA TODAY that divestment from Postal Service competitors is not a requirement.\n\n\"The postmaster general is not required to divest of all of his assets in these kinds of investments. However, he needs to steer clear of decisions that would materially benefit the companies he is invested in. He should recuse himself from such decisions if it even comes close to that line,” Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute said in an email.\n\nDeJoy has committed to compliance with Postal Service regulations, according to a statement from Partenheimer.\n\n“I take my ethical obligations seriously, and I have done what is necessary to ensure that I am and will remain in compliance with those obligations,” DeJoy stated.\n\nOur rating: Missing Context\n\nWe rate this claim as MISSING CONTEXT, based on our research. Louis DeJoy and his wife Aldona Wos reported between at least $30 million to just over $75 million in assets from XPO Logistics, J.B. Hunt and UPS. All are competitors with U.S. Postal Service operations. While government records confirm their ownership of the assets, the exact value of the holdings is not clear from the records.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

But that wasn't always the case.\n\nMore than 25 years ago, Sony unleashed its first PlayStation, barging into a marketplace dominated by Nintendo and, to a lesser extent, Sega. And seven years later, Microsoft brought forth its Xbox.\n\nWhether you are voting with your wallet this holiday season for a new Xbox Series X or S, or PlayStation 5, you can't argue these two tech giants have made countless contributions to advance video gaming over the years.\n\nSony and Microsoft also expanded the audience. The PlayStation, released in the U.S. in September 1995, would sell more than 102 million units, blasting past sales figures for previous video game consoles that connected to TVs.\n\nHow to pick the right video game console:Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, or Nintendo Switch?\n\n'Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War':A spy game worthy of your time, regardless of your video game system\n\nNintendo continued to dominate in portable game systems, but it would be a decade until one of its consoles cracked the 100 million sales mark: The Wii, released in November 2006, would go on to sell 101.6 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony solidified its position with the PlayStation 2, a console that remains the top-seller ever at more than 155 million systems sold. In comparison, the PlayStation 4 has sold more than 113.5 million since its arrival seven years ago.\n\nAs the latest consoles arrive in homes, Microsoft is gaining on Sony for dominance. And the tech titans are building out cloud-based game services – as are competitors Google, Amazon and Facebook.\n\nThis round of new game systems could, said Pedro Palandrani, analyst for research firm Global X, \"be the final chapter of the console era.\"\n\nSony PlayStation targets living rooms\n\nSony entered the video game market with a different strategy than Nintendo and Sega: It wanted to take over the living room.\n\nIronically, Sony had sought a deal with Nintendo to create a new Super Nintendo with a CD drive that would play games and music discs. When Nintendo spurned Sony, the electronics company opted to go it alone.\n\nKen Kutaragi, known as the father of the PlayStation, wanted to take video games from \"a flat 2D environment\" into \"360-degree 'space',\" he told USA TODAY in 2015. That goal to \"develop and adopt state-of-the-art technology that is forward-looking for a gaming console\" was meant to change the image of video games from that of toys to high-end entertainment.\n\nThe first PlayStation would play CDs, the PS2 played DVDs and the PlayStation 3, launched in 2006, played all of those discs and new high resolution movies on Blu-ray discs, a format developed by Sony along with other electronics companies, including Panasonic, Pioneer, LG and Samsung.\n\n\"Sony, given its background in consumer electronics and physical media distribution, was able to position the console as a DVD player early on, and a Blu-Ray player as well,\" said P. J. McNealy, an analyst and consultant at Digital World Research.\n\nXbox Series X and Series S review:New game consoles attempt to lighten the load\n\nVideo games:Perfect stay-at-home pastime during pandemic leads to record-setting levels\n\nAnd Sony differed from Nintendo, which focused on its own games, such as \"Super Mario World\" and \"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.\" Instead, Sony sought out third-party game developers, such as Namco and Konami, to make games such as \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Metal Gear Solid\" for PlayStations.\n\nThe Psycho Mantis boss battle and mind-reading scene from \"Metal Gear Solid\" is \"one of the defining game design moments in history,\" said Gordon Bellamy, a visiting scholar in the USC Games program who teaches a course on the PlayStation 4. He is also the past executive director of the International Game Developers Association and currently on the board of directors of the virtual entertainment company Wave.\n\nThe Metal Gear games and the Grand Theft Auto series, which gained a following on PlayStation, continued \"to redefine the boundaries of the art form,\" Bellamy said.\n\n\"Sony was able to marshal the support of third parties who made PC games (and to some extent, arcade games) and bring them into consumers’ homes,\" said Michael Pachter, analyst with Wedbush Securities. \"That was a big deal.\"\n\nEventually, Sony's own studios created hit franchises such as God of War, Gran Turismo and Uncharted.\n\n\"That is a distinct advantage and has helped drive Sony's dominant lead over Xbox in units sold over the past two cycles,\" McNealy said.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation brand shifted the balance of video game power, interrupting Nintendo's dominance, speeding Sega's exit from the console business and spurring Microsoft to join the game.\n\nMicrosoft Xbox and its 'Halo'\n\nIn the 90s, Microsoft had a strong PC gaming studio with hits such as \"Age of Empires\" and \"Flight Simulator.\" But the company's hardware division wanted to make it easier for consumers to play PC-quality games and connect with each other. With co-founder Bill Gates' approval, work on what would become the Xbox began in 1998.\n\n\"I think Microsoft had a fear of missing out,\" said Dean Takahashi, lead writer for GamesBeat at VentureBeat and author of two books, \"Opening the Xbox\" and \"The Xbox 360 Uncloaked.\"\n\n\"It worried that Sony and the PlayStation 2 were going to take over entertainment in the home, and that would present a threat to Microsoft's stronghold with the PC,\" Takahashi said. \"So it counterattacked with the Xbox. And eventually it became less about playing defense and more about doing the right things for game developers and gamers. I think the latter approach put it on the right road to all kinds of market and financial success.\"\n\nA key to the success of Xbox, Microsoft's acquisition of the studio Bungie, which was developing what would become the first-person shooting game \"Halo: Combat Evolved,\" a launch title for the original Xbox in November 2001.\n\nThe game, which starred a hero known as \"Master Chief,\" would grow into a franchise for subsequent Xbox consoles.\n\n\"This was the first time the story itself and character and the setting and the music compelled me to continue playing the game,\" Microsoft's head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, told USA TODAY in 2014. He was part of Microsoft Games Studio when the software giant acquired Bungie. \"I think that has always been a strength of the Halo franchise.\"\n\nPlayers could connect their Xbox systems together to compete in multiplayer games. Then, in 2002, Microsoft turned on its Xbox Live online service, which let players connect via broadband. Today, Xbox Live, which is required for online multiplayer games, has nearly 100 million subscribers.\n\n\"Microsoft had the vision of multiplayer gaming, and fortunately pushed into shooters with Halo as the poster child for multiplayer,\" Pachter said. \"They leveraged their cloud supremacy and made multiplayer work, and that begat 'Call of Duty,' which in turn begat 'Fortnite.' That’s a pretty huge contribution.\"\n\nMicrosoft also \"discovered and unlocked the untapped talent of Western game developers, who were successful with PC and Mac games but had been left out of the console market,\" Takahashi said.\n\nWith games such as \"Gears of War,\" which would become a hit Xbox franchise, Microsoft, like Sony, \"left the cartoon world of Nintendo behind,\" he said.\n\nThe Xbox sold more than 24 million units. Its successor the Xbox 360, which debuted in 2005, would sell 84 million.\n\nThe Xbox 360, which would also play DVDs and music CDs, solidified Microsoft's online presence with a well-designed Xbox Live update in 2008. It was also the first console to let you use Netflix.\n\n\"Before everyone had Apple TVs and Chromecasts, and before TVs came with Wi-Fi and an app store – we had our consoles,\" said Morgan Webb, who works in community and culture for Bonfire Studios and is a former co-host and producer of the long-running X-Play series on G4.\n\nVideo game consoles \"played games, but they also showed us a little bit of the future,\" she said. \"You didn't have to buy anything new to get Netflix, and YouTube on your TV. I always appreciated when they would add new, free features. It was dramatized that they were battling for control of the living room, but they were also bringing a lot of features and content to something I already owned. It's hard to get mad at that.\"\n\nPlayStation 5 review:A powerhouse video game console with innovative controls\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man:Miles Morales review: An amazing adventure for the PlayStation 5\n\nVideo games continue online migration\n\nSony and Microsoft offered games you could buy and download without needing to go to a retailer. \"Each created the concept of a 'store' and because each had to develop capacity for digital downloads, they created an opportunity for independent developers to be discovered,\" Pachter said.\n\nBeyond that, \"the PlayStation Store demystified digital distribution for a generation of game players,\" Bellamy said.\n\nSony began offering its PlayStation Plus subscription in 2010, with discounts on new games, free trials and access to online gaming.\n\nSince then, Sony and Microsoft have launched cloud gaming subscriptions – akin to a Netflix for video games – that let you play from a library of games. PlayStation Now, launched in 2014, has more than 2.2 million. Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass has gained more than 15 million subscribers in its three years.\n\n\"Microsoft was the first to show the value proposition of an online service in Xbox Live, and now they're ahead of the pack doing it again with its subscription service with Xbox GamePass,\" McNealy said. \"While there will be plenty of focus on number of console units sold, the battle is shifted to online usage and commerce numbers, and subscriptions will be a big part of it over this console cycle.\"\n\nFor the Xbox One and the new consoles, Microsoft has created an Xbox All Access subscription giving consumers a console, Xbox Live and Xbox Game Pass for a monthly payment over two years – similar to buying a new smartphone – as a way to expand its market.\n\n\"Subscriptions will enable new offerings for consumers who might find spending $300-$500 on a console challenging given the economic environment,\" McNealy said.\n\nBeyond video games, some missteps\n\nThere's been misses along the way. Both Sony and Microsoft attempted to match the Nintendo Wii's motion technology with the Kinect and PlayStation Move add-ons. Each had a camera, sensors and microphone to let you get your body and voice into games. But neither truly caught on.\n\n\"There were some experiments that didn't work as well, but I loved the spirit of innovation,\" Webb said. \"Remember when we all freaked out that the Kinect was going to sit in our living rooms and listen to everything we said? Now we don't seem to mind, though the Kinect never really lived up to the promise. It was never compelling enough to warrant a complete living room reorg.\"\n\nNeither company could crack Nintendo's hold on portable gaming with the Zune or PlayStation Portable and PS Vita. These \"expensive failures\" came from \"venturing into things they were bad at,\" Pachter said.\n\nSony's PlayStation Network suffered a massive hack in 2011, at the time one of the largest in history. Microsoft had a red ring of death controversy hit its Xbox 360 consoles. The company extended the warranty on the consoles; repair and shipping costs led Microsoft to take a charge of more than $1 billion to pay for the costs.\n\nMore recently, Sony attempted to enter the streaming TV market. Its PlayStation Vue service, launched in 2015, had more than 60 channels for $40 monthly. But competition from YouTube TV and others led Sony to shut it down in January. .\n\nThe console wars continue\n\nSony appears poised to maintain its dominance in consoles sold, predicts Piers Harding-Rolls, research director for games at Ampere Analysis.\n\nSony, he said, \"remains in a good position for the new generation,\" and will likely sell 8.5 million PS5s worldwide by the end of March, he estimates. Microsoft \"will be more competitive,\" selling 6.5 million Xbox Series S/X consoles.\n\nBy 2024, PS5 sales are expected to reach 67 million, compared with Xbox Series S/X sales of 44 million, Ampere Analysis forecasts.\n\nThe new consoles arrive at a good time, with the COVID-19 pandemic keeping many folks at home. Games are one of the few entertainment sectors expected to see growth this year, with a forecast compound annual growth rate of 6.4% from now to 2024, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n\n\"Video games in the pandemic have continued to flourish,\" said PwC principal CJ Bangah.\n\nU.S. spending on games in 2020 is expected to hit a new record of $50 billion, fueled by $13.4 billion in spending during the holiday season, according to The NPD Group.\n\nDespite the hype of new consoles, NPD's Mat Piscatella expects the Nintendo Switch, which has sold more than 68 million units since its release in 2017, \"to continue on its current trajectory as being one of the fastest-selling consoles in U.S. history.\"\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/11/13/celebrities-leave-twitter-elon-musk-trump-administration/76268581007/", "title": "Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Lemon ditch Twitter as Trump appoints Elon ...", "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Lemon are among the big-name X (formerly Twitter) users leaving the social media site since President-elect Donald Trump announced the platform's owner, Elon Musk, will have a role in his administration.\n\nIn a Nov. 13 Instagram post, \"Halloween\" actress Curtis shared a screenshot showing her X account's successful deactivation. In her caption, she quoted the Serenity Prayer: \"God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change. Courage to change the things I can. And the wisdom to know the difference.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Curtis for comment.\n\nAround the same time, former CNN anchor Lemon posted an Instagram Reel and a statement on X detailing his reasons for leaving the Musk-owned platform, with which he's had a contentious relationship. In August, Lemon sued Musk over a scrapped content partnership deal with X.\n\n“I have loved connecting with all of you on Twitter and then on X for all of these years, but it’s time for me to leave the platform,” Lemon said in the Reel. “I once believed it was a place for honest debate and discussion, transparency, and free speech, but I now feel it does not serve that purpose.”\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nLemon also pointed to X's new terms of service, which go into effect on Friday and direct all legal disputes to be \"brought exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts located in Tarrant County, Texas.\"\n\n“As the Washington Post recently reported on X’s decision to change the terms, this ‘ensures that such lawsuits will be heard in courthouses that are a hub for conservatives, which experts say could make it easier for X to shield itself from litigation and punish critics,'” Lemon said. “I think that speaks for itself.”\n\nThis is not the first time changes at X have prompted high-profile users to leave the platform. In 2022, after Musk bought the site, stars like Jim Carrey and Whoopi Goldberg deactivated their accounts.\n\nCelebrities react to Trump's win:See posts from Cardi B, Joe Rogan, Stephen King and more\n\nGabrielle Union declares 'Enough is enough'\n\nOn Nov. 15, Gabrielle Union released a statement on X announcing her departure from the platform.\n\nThe \"L.A.'s Finest\" actress wrote, \"There are pivotal moments in life when we must declare that enough is enough — and for me, today is that day.\n\n“Platforms like X were founded on authentic connections, true engagement and creative expression, all anchored in respect for user privacy and trust. Yet with the recent and upcoming changes to the terms of service — and the return of volatile figures — I find myself at a crossroads, facing a direction I can no longer fully support.”\n\nThe actress continued, “I am committed to engaging in spaces that truly value inclusivity, respect and integrity in the digital word. Sometimes, that means recognizing the last straw and knowing when to step away.”\n\nUnion encouraged fans to keep up-to-date with her on Instagram, Threads and Facebook, as well as TikTok, BlueSky and Spill.\n\nBlueSky, which was founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in 2019, reported 2.5 million new signups in the post-election week and record engagement, including likes and follows. According to X's self-reported data on Nov. 5-6, the site saw a 15.5% increase in new user signups on Election Day and boasted a record number of posts and time spent on the mobile app.\n\nStephen King says X has 'become too toxic'\n\n\"King of Horror\" Stephen King, once an avid X user, has wiped his account of all posts, except for his Nov. 14 announcement that he's \"leaving Twitter.\"\n\n\"Tried to stay, but the atmosphere has just become too toxic. Follow me on Threads, if you like,\" the \"Carrie\" and \"Salem's Lot\" author wrote.\n\nIn his reaction to the presidential election results the previous week (among the deleted posts), King expressed concern for democracy. \"There's a sign you can see in many shops that sell beautiful but fragile items: LOVELY TO LOOK AT, DELIGHTFUL TO HOLD, BUT ONCE YOU BREAK IT, THEN IT'S SOLD. You can say the same about democracy,\" the author wrote.\n\nUK news outlet The Guardian is also leaving 'toxic' Twitter\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the U.K. newspaper The Guardian, which also has offices in the U.S. and Australia, announced plans to stop sharing content with its 27 million followers across more than 80 accounts on X.\n\n\"We think that the benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives and that resources could be better used promoting our journalism elsewhere,\" the outlet's announcement reads.\n\n\"This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism. The US presidential election campaign served only to underline what we have considered for a long time: that X is a toxic media platform and that its owner, Elon Musk, has been able to use its influence to shape political discourse.\"\n\nThe message concludes: \"Thankfully, we can do this because our business model does not rely on viral content tailored to the whims of the social media giants’ algorithms – instead we’re funded directly by our readers.\"\n\nMusk quickly fired back a response: \"They are irrelevant.\" In a separate post, he wrote, \"They are a dying publication.\"\n\n'America is done'Cardi B, Joe Rogan, Stephen King and more stars react to Trump's win\n\nWhat is Elon Musk's role in Trump's second presidency?\n\nLast April, NPR left X after its main account was labeled \"state-affiliated media,\" then later \"government-funded media.\" The designation was \"falsely implying that we are not editorially independent,\" the nonprofit news company said in a statement to USA TODAY at the time.\n\nA day later, PBS left the platform under the same circumstances.\n\nMusk, who also owns SpaceX and Tesla, bought the social media site then known as Twitter in 2022 for a reported $44 billion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump announced Musk, who backed his return to the White House with public appearances and reportedly millions in donations, and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a former rival for the Republican presidential ticket, as his picks to co-lead a so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe department would \"dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure federal agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.

The more than 700,000 employees at both companies represent one out of six of all U.S. supermarket, supercenter and warehouse club workers. The rivals' combined $170 billion food sales are nearly a fifth of America's $1 trillion grocery market.\n\nRegulators at the Federal Trade Commission have refused to discuss the proposal, but have spent more than a year scrutinizing the deal.\n\nHere are highlights of how The Enquirer has covered the merger so far:\n\n2024:\n\nState regulators sue to stop merger as talks with federal officials force a delay\n\nThe state attorney general for Washington filed a lawsuit seeking to shut down the merger. In his lawsuit, internal chats by Albertsons’ executives revealed company officials doubted the legality of the deal and were skeptical of promises that it would lower prices for consumers. Meanwhile, Kroger said ongoing negotiations with federal and state regulators would delay the completion of the deal as late as mid-August.\n\nMore: Before the Washington lawsuit and delay, court records in a California lawsuit revealed that federal regulators weren’t convinced of “the merits” of the deal. Records showed regulators, even after more than a year of scrutiny, were seeking more time to evaluate the deal and related divestiture plans.\n\nFood prices remain high at the supermarket\n\nAs antitrust regulators weigh the proposed merger's impact on competition and ultimately consumer prices, the latest government data released in January shows food prices remain high.\n\nInflation at the supermarket (food-at-home costs) has risen higher than the overall cost of living since the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in March 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n2023:\n\nKroger now controls almost 50% of grocery sales in its hometown, could it happen elsewhere?\n\nAs cities from Seattle to Houston fret about supermarket consolidation, The Enquirer took a look at how Kroger and Walmart amassed dominant market share in Cincinnati. Remember Thriftway and Bigg’s? So does Bill Remke, the former president of his family’s namesake grocery chain. Remke also recounts the family tragedy that forced them to sell the local grocery chain. Meanwhile, Remke Markets’ new owner, Michael Needler, testified before the U.S. Senate about the merger’s potential to squeeze independent grocers like him.\n\nKroger’s and Albertsons’ plan to reassure regulators\n\nIn September, Kroger and Albertsons unveiled a $1.9 billion plan to sell off 413 stores to Piggly Wiggly operator and franchiser C&S Wholesale Grocers. In a bid to show regulators that consumers will have other options, Kroger said it would also shed all of its Marianno's stores (in Chicago) and QFC stores (in the Pacific Northwest), while Albertsons will shed the Carrs nameplate in Alaska. All in, the two grocers said they’d shed stores in 17 states.\n\nDeparting Albertsons executives poised to reap millions if deal goes through\n\nCompany filings show the top 11 executives at Albertsons could collect almost $190 million in severance packages and other pay upon completion of the merger with Kroger. Albertsons CEO Vivek Sankaran alone could get between $30 million and $43 million in \"golden parachute\" and other pay, according to company regulatory disclosures.\n\nBenefit to Kroger and Albertsons shoppers? About 22 cents per $100 spent\n\nKroger and Albertsons say shoppers will enjoy lower prices after they merge. The two companies have said they’ll “invest” $500 million in lowering prices on items on shelves. But how does that compare with the companies’ combined $226 billion in sales? Less than 0.25%.\n\nKroger CEO says company will fight for deal in court\n\nIn May, CEO Rodney McMullen told Bloomberg News the company and Albertsons had “committed to litigate in advance” against regulators, if they opposed the merger.\n\nA month earlier, he and Sankaran co-authored an editorial seeking to reassure the public about the merger. In the op-ed piece, the CEOS promised the merger would deliver lower prices, more choices and keep jobs.\n\nAfter months of silence from regulators, antitrust experts believe a fight is brewing\n\nBig mergers happen all the time, right? Maybe not this time. Antitrust experts note that regulators under the Biden Administration have been fighting more big deals – and the proposed Kroger-Albertsons corporate marriage was a very big deal. Also, having the FTC chair label a previous Albertsons merger a “spectacular failure” signals at least a very hard look at the deal.\n\n2022:\n\nSkepticism, resistance and doubts over deal mount\n\nSeveral weeks after the deal was first announced, the FTC has made a key “second request” for information from Kroger about the deal. The disclosure indicates the agency plans an extensive review that will take months. Meanwhile, several state officials say they are investigating the merger proposal over antitrust concerns. Some states also sue over a special dividend payment to Albertsons shareholders that was part of the deal.\n\nKroger CEO tells The Enquirer why he wants to buy his rival\n\nThe day the deal was unveiled, The Enquirer asked Kroger’s CEO Rodney McMullen about the deal.\n\nKroger and Albertsons announce their plan to combine\n\nAfter months of quiet negotiation and days of rumors on Wall Street, Kroger and Albertsons announced their big deal to merge.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/14/trump-tiktok-ban-opinion-change-explained/72945840007/", "title": "Does Trump want to ban TikTok? What's behind his flip-flopping", "text": "Former President Donald Trump reversed his position on TikTok this week, coming out against a bill to ban the app or force its sale shortly before the House of Representatives voted Wednesday morning to do just that.\n\nWhile in the White House in 2020, Trump attempted to ban the app from the United States unless it sold itself to an American company. At the time he said Chinese ownership gave Beijing’s authoritarian government access to the personal information of American users.\n\n\"This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans’ personal and proprietary information — potentially allowing China to track the locations of federal employees and contractors, build dossiers of personal information for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTikTok said it would never hand over that information. It has spent $1.5 billion building Project Texas, which is supposed to stop any effort by the Chinese government to access the data of American users by confining that information to U.S. servers. But some Americans remain concerned that ByteDance would have to hand over that data if ordered by Chinese authorities.\n\nOn Monday, Trump told CNBC that he now opposes taking action to separate either the CCP from TikTok or TikTok from American users.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n“Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it,” Trump said in an interview with CNBC posted Monday. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. There are a lot of users, a lot of good, and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok.”\n\nTrump's comments came less than two weeks after reports that he met with a billionaire conservative donor who is part-owner of the parent company,\n\nTrump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his campaign has not commented directly on the relevance of Trump's meeting with the donor, but there are other possible explanations for Trump's flip flop, including his antipathy for Facebook and its creator Mark Zuckerberg, and a desire to appeal to TikTok's users and investors.\n\nTrump's comments echo Republican complaints about Facebook\n\nTrump said that banning TikTok would benefit rival Facebook, “and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the American people.” He criticized Facebook parent company Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s donations during the 2020 election to nonprofits that help local election offices improve their technology, educate voters, train poll workers, and get out the vote.\n\nThat echoed a Truth Social post last Thursday in which Trump alleged Facebook “cheated in the last election” and referred to Zuckerberg as “Zuckerschmuck,\" a nickname that borrows the Yiddish word “schmuck” to insult Zuckerberg, who is Jewish. That drew condemnation from CNN Anchor Dana Bash for being \"offensive.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, \"The President also shares concerns about Facebook, which we know has been used to manipulate millions of users and interfere in the 2020 election.\" Neither Trump on Truth Social nor Cheung in his statement provided any evidence of this interference.\n\nRepublicans in Congress held a hearing in February that targeted Zuckerberg’s giving to the Center for Tech and Civic Life and the Center for Election Innovation and Research. The right often refers to these donations as \"Zuckerbucks\" — a nickname denounced by the Anti-Defamation League for evoking antisemitic tropes.\n\nRepublicans say that private money should not be funding election administration, and Trump argues that Zuckerberg's philanthropy should be considered illegal campaign contributions. The bipartisan Federal Election Commission decided unanimously in 2022 that the donations are not illegal campaign contributions.\n\nA writer for the Cato Institute, a right-leaning think tank, wrote in 2022 that Zuckerberg's donations did not influence the outcome of the 2020 election.\n\nFrom Capitol Hill:Congress plows ahead with bill targeting TikTok against Donald Trump's wishes\n\nTrump's new stance aligns with conservative advocacy group\n\nOn March 1, Trump met with billionaire Jeff Yass at a donor retreat for Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group that has opposed Trump's impeachment, according to ABC News, which said it obtained a video clip from the meeting. Yass’s investment company, Susquehanna International Group, bought a large stake in ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, in 2012.\n\nYass is also a major donor to the Club for Growth’s super PAC, one of the players in the 2024 election that funds many of Trump’s allies in the House and Senate. Yass gave $23.5 million to Club for Growth Action from 2017 to 2020, during Trump's time in office, and has given $33.5 million since 2021, according to the latest records from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nTrump and many congressional Republicans were nonetheless very critical of TikTok at that time.\n\nDavid McIntosh, the president of Club for Growth, wrote a 2023 op-ed advocating against banning TikTok and gave a presentation in January on “the political risk of restricting or banning TikTok,” according to National Review. Former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway is working for Club for Growth to advocate in Congress for TikTok, according to Politico.\n\nA bill in the House to force China to divest from TikTok or face a ban passed 352 to 65 on Wednesday with strong bipartisan support. Proponents argue that China's involvement with the social media app is a threat to national security.\n\n“America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States,\" said Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wisconsin, who heads the House's select committee on the Chinese Communist Party. \"TikTok’s time in the United States is over unless it ends its relationship with CCP-controlled ByteDance.”\n\nTikTok said in a statement after the bill passed: \"This process was secret and the bill was jammed through for one reason: It's a ban. We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service.\"\n\nMany TikTok users also oppose a ban, including communities of activists for causes such as disability rights.\n\nFrom 2023:Meta to restore Trump Facebook and Instagram accounts, reversing Jan. 6 Capitol attack ban\n\nTrump's view aligns with the interests of TikTok investors and users\n\n“The real story behind TikTok is money and politics,” said James Lewis, a China expert and senior vice president at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nTikTok’s Chinese parent ByteDance valued itself at more than $200 billion last year when it bought back shares from existing investors. It recently launched a new share buyback. Its goal is to go public, Lewis said, but the value of TikTok in an initial public offering would be undercut by a TikTok ban in the U.S.\n\n“The investors in TikTok would like to cash out,” Lewis said. “They would like to do an IPO.\"\n\nWealthy investors like Yass hold a lot of sway with politicians, due to their importance to the economy and their ability to donate to political campaigns, Lewis said.\n\nAccording to ABC News, although Trump clashed with the Club for Growth over endorsements in Republican primaries, Trump spoke highly of Yass and McIntosh at the group's recent donor retreat, saying, \"We're back in love.\"\n\nYass did not comment for the ABC News story, but he previously told The Wall Street Journal, \"TikTok is about free speech and innovation, the epitome of libertarian and free market ideals. The idea of banning TikTok is an anathema to everything I believe.”\n\nThere may be other executives in Trump's orbit who have ties to TikTok. Oracle CEO Safra Catz served on Trump's transition team in 2016. The business software giant scored a $1.5 billion agreement in 2022 to serve as ByteDance’s “trusted technology provider” to relocate all Americans’ user data to servers in the U.S.\n\nTrump's stance could benefit his other interests\n\nTrump’s personal business and political interests could also be in play, according to China expert and Ohio State University professor Oded Shenkar.\n\nBy aligning himself with TikTok, which is popular with young people, Trump could attract a more youthful demographic to his businesses, including a new line of gold sneakers, and generate support from younger voters.\n\nHe could also gain favor with Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese government and state-linked entities spent more than $5.5 million at Trump Tower in New York and two of Trump’s hotels in Washington and Las Vegas while he was president, according to public documents and internal financial records obtained by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.\n\n“TikTok’s owner’s substantial lobbying efforts in the US suggest that they would highly value Trump’s conciliatory position towards them,” Shenkar said.\n\nTrump campaign is now recalibrating\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung revised Trump's stance again, saying he is concerned about TikTok but not backing the bill before Congress.\n\n\"President Trump made clear in his CNBC interview this week that he viewed Chinese ownership of Tik Tok as a national security threat, while at the same time appreciating it is an app used and liked by millions of Americans,\" Cheung wrote.\n\n\"That's why the President took strong action in 2020 to protect the privacy and data of American users of Tik Tok as well as establish a framework for Congress to follow to protect Americans from the threats posed by Chinese-owned technology companies operating in the United States,\" he wrote.\n\n\"President Trump believes Congress must take action to protect the security and privacy of American users on all social media platforms.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2022/04/19/netflix-loses-subscribers-stock-plunges/7372839001/", "title": "Netflix stock price falls after it loses 200k subscribers in 3 months", "text": "Are you still watching?\n\nNetflix's familiar prompt when binge watching a show now points to an urgent issue facing the streaming giant: Subscribers, no longer stuck in a binge-prone pandemic stasis and with more competitors than ever to choose from, are no longer a captive audience and are increasingly tuning out.\n\nNetflix suffered the first loss in worldwide subscribers in a decade, deepening troubles that have been mounting since a surge from a locked-down audience during the pandemic’s early stages began to fade.\n\nShares of Netflix plunged more than 36% in Wednesday morning trading.\n\nHow bad is it? Management predicted a conservative gain of 2.5 million subscribers. Instead, Netflix reported its customer base fell by 200,000 subscribers during the January-March period, according to a quarterly report released Tuesday.\n\n\"The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently,\" co-CEO Reed Hastings said in a letter to investors. Another culprit is widespread password sharing, he said. Hastings estimated that Netflix is being shared with over 100 million households worldwide, with about 30 million in the U.S and Canada.\n\nThe company recently announced it was taking steps to put the kibosh on sharing accounts, testing new features in Chile, Costa Rica and Peru that would require paying extra if users want to share their account with someone outside their household. Hastings indicated in Tuesday's earnings call that this could also be coming to the U.S. in around a year’s time.\n\nAlso possibly to blame for Netflix's woes? A price hike in January, which Netflix said was to \"continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options.\" Its basic plan starts at $9.99, up from $8.99 previously.\n\nThe popular Standard plan, which supports high-definition content and allows users to watch separately on two screens, jumps from $13.99 to $15.49. The Premium plan, which offers Ultra HD and supports up to four screens simultaneously, will increase from $17.99 a month to $19.99 a month.\n\nNetflix said Tuesday in its earnings call that it's introducing a lower-priced ad-supported version of its service. The company is also trying to give people another reason to subscribe by adding video games at no extra charge – a feature that began to roll out last year.\n\nThis is the first time that Netflix's subscribers have contracted since it became available throughout most of the world six years ago.\n\nNetflix is bracing for things to get worse with a projected loss of another 2 million subscribers during the April-June period.\n\nThe disappointing performance caused Netflix’s stock price to plunge 23% in extended trading. Investors had already been bailing out of the company's once high-flying stock amid a dramatic slowdown in subscriber growth. If the shares behave similarly in Wednesday’s regular trading session, Netflix’s stock will have lost more than half its value so far this year.\n\nIt marks the fourth time in the last five quarters that Netflix’s subscriber growth has fallen below the gains of the previous year, raising investor fears that its streaming service is mired in a malaise that has been magnified by growing competition from well-funded rivals like Apple and Walt Disney.\n\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Michelle Maltais on Twitter: @mmaltaisla", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/04/election-2024-live-updates-trump-harris/76033477007/", "title": "Election 2024 Monday recap: Trump, Harris make final push for votes", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news on the campaign trail for the 2024 election on Monday, Nov. 4.

The Republican and Democratic nominees have spent months facing off and laying out their campaign promises on issues ranging from health care to immigration and the economy.\n\nOn the final full day of campaigning, Trump held rallies in pivotal swing states, starting in North Carolina before heading to Pennsylvania for two campaign stops and wrapping up the day in Michigan.\n\nHarris concluded her campaign in Pennsylvania after holding rallies in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, followed by a concert in Allentown.\n\nKeep up with live coverage from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nPresidential election polls 2024:Latest surveys on Harris vs. Trump before Election Day\n\nOprah, Lady Gaga join Harris rally in Philadelphia\n\nKamala Harris' rally in Philadelphia got underway late in the evening with Lady Gaga singing \"God Bless America\" in front of 30,000 people.\n\nIt’s not often that Lady Gaga is the opening act instead of the main attraction.\n\nSeated at a piano, she spoke briefly about the importance of the election. Women will be part of the decision-making on Tuesday, she said, adding, “I am holding in my heart all the tough, tenacious women who made me who I am.”\n\nGaga said she voted for Harris, “someone who will be a president for all Americans.”\n\nHarris' husband Doug Emhoff spoke next and told the crowd, \"My wife cares about what you're going through. She understands what's in your way, and she has concrete plans to help us keep moving forward. Now, isn't that what we want for the next four years?\"\n\nOprah Winfrey was next on stage. She invoked the late John F. Kennedy and the late civil rights leader and Georgia Rep. John Lewis and told prospective voters who might be feeling burnt out that the election was too important to sit out.\n\n\"If we don't show up tomorrow, it is entirely possible that we might not have the opportunity to ever cast a ballot again,\" she said.\n\n- Francesca Chambers and Michael Collins\n\nTrump doubles down on election fraud claims at last rally\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spread 2020 election misinformation, claimed without evidence that Democrats would try to “cheat” in the 2024 election at his last rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n\"When you have open borders, transgender everything, high taxes - very high taxes, they're campaigning on the fact that they're going to raise everybody's taxes - and you have men playing in women's sports, you have to cheat…They have to cheat. They have to cheat. And they do it and they do it very well,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also cast doubt on the accuracy of voting machines in his speech. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, states routinely test and certify their voting machines and conduct checks to ensure ballots are properly counted before election results are finalized.\n\nFor months, Trump and his allies have tried to sow uncertainty around the security of the 2024 race, which political science and democracy experts said would only increase the risk of political violence in the aftermath of the election.\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump tells Grand Rapids: 'We're going to blow this thing away'\n\nDonald Trump started his remarks in Grand Rapids, Michigan, by reminiscing about the city, the same place he ended both his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\n“I want to say a very special hello to Grand Rapids. It's been a special place,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said he thinks he’s in “very good shape” for Election Day.\n\n“You're going to turn out tomorrow, and we're going to blow this thing away. Because, you know, we're leading. We're leading going in by hundreds of thousands of votes, but just pretend we're tied or losing by a little bit, because we want to put on a display tomorrow of unity and everything,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nThe final results of the 2024 race won’t be ready on election night. Some key swing states that Trump and Harris are vying for, like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, aren't permitted to start processing absentee and mail-in ballots until Election Day, which is expected to slow down the count.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'You will decide the outcome,' Harris tells Pennsylvania\n\nHarris told her supporters in Philadelphia on Monday that the swing state's voters would choose the next U.S. president.\n\n\"You will decide the outcome of this election, Pennsylvania,\" she said.\n\nHarris said at the rally, the last one of her campaign: \"America is ready for a fresh start, ready for a new way forward.\"\n\nShe pledged to be a president \"for all Americans\" and told the crowd that \"one of the highest forms of patriotism\" is to fight for the ideals and promise of America.\n\n\"I have always believed in our nation's promise because I have lived it,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she sees that same promise in the faces of her rallygoers. \"We are the promise of America,\" she declared from outside the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\n- Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump escalates rhetoric against migrants, opponent\n\nDonald Trump suggested at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday that Penn State wrestlers should fight against migrants.\n\n“Those Penn State guys. I wanted them to wrestle the migrants . . . I told (Ultimate Fighting Championship President) Dana (White) here to set up your league of champions, unbelievable, best fighters in the world, and a migrant league. At the end, I want the migrant to go against the champion, and I think the migrant might actually win. That's how nasty some of these guys are,” Trump said.\n\nAt his previous rally in Reading, Pennsylvania, Trump suggested that Kamala Harris should be in the same ring as boxer Mike Tyson.\n\n“‘Put Mike in the ring with Kamala.’ That will be interesting,” Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump has previously called his political opponents garbage, scum and enemy from within. Trump's latest comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi and Josh Meyer\n\nJoe Rogan endorses Trump\n\nJoe Rogan, who hosts the podcast “The Joe Rogan Experience,” endorsed Trump in a post on X, formerly Twitter, sharing a video clip of an interview with Elon Musk as part of his announcement.\n\nMusk “makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way,” Rogan wrote on X. “For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump. Enjoy the podcast.”\n\nTrump and Rogan had previously sat down for a nearly three hour interview last month, where the two discussed topics ranging from extraterrestrial aliens to election interference.\n\n“He was great. And he's not a person that does endorsements, but he did an endorsement. So I just want to thank Joe Rogan. That's fantastic,” Trump said at his rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Monday.\n\nHarris did not appear on Rogan’s show. He wrote on X that her campaign had reached out to him and offered a date for an interview, but he ended up declining because he would have had to travel to her. “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin,” he wrote.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nHarris stops by Puerto Rican restaurant in Pennsylvania\n\nVice President Kamala Harris grabbed dinner at Puerto Rican restaurant Monday night after a rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nHarris’ motorcade stopped by Old San Juan Cafe in Reading, where she was greeted by the owner Diana de La Rosa. La Rosa gave the Democratic presidential nominee a tour of the small eatery and helped her place her order, which included cassava and yellow rice.\n\n“I’m very hungry,” Harris said. “I don’t get a chance to eat as often as I like.”\n\nSpotted inside the restaurant during Harris’ visit: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., and Reading Mayor Eddie Moran.\n\nHarris’ campaign has been making a push to reach Puerto Rican voters, especially after a comedian called the U.S. territory a “floating island of garbage” at a Donald Trump rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nTrump: 'God saved me in order to save America'\n\nDonald Trump urged his supporters in Pittsburgh to get out and vote, referencing the July assassination attempt where he was shot in the ear by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n“Many people say that God saved me in order to save America,” Trump told the crowd, who burst into cheers.\n\n“And with your help, we will fulfill that extraordinary mission,\" Trump said. “Together, we're going to fulfill - we're going to save our country. But many, many people have said that. To every citizen across this land, I am asking for the honor of your vote.”\n\nTrump also said he would restore peace in the world and criticized his opponent’s handling of issues, including immigration.\n\n“We do not have to live this way,” he said.\n\nTrump and Harris are both deadlocked in Pennsylvania, a crucial swing state. Both candidates crisscrossed through the state on Monday to court voters before Election Day.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRapper Will.i.am performs new song 'Yes She Can'\n\nRapper Will.i.am warmed up the crowd at an election-eve rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia on Monday by performing a new song, “Yes She Can.”\n\n“What is wrong with America? Why can’t we get along in America?” the lyrics ask.\n\nThe song goes on to suggest that together Americans can break down barriers and urges them to “register and vote for your life.”\n\n“We could be better than we ever been, we about to have a woman president,” the song concludes, repeating the refrain, “Yes she can!”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHarris knocks on doors in last-minute push in Pennsylvania\n\nSearching for any and every possible vote in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, Vice President Kamala Harris did a little door-knocking herself Monday night.\n\nHarris was joined by two campaign staff members as she briefly stopped by two homes in Reading, Pennsylvania. At one front door, Harris was greeted by a woman who immediately gave her a hug.\n\n“How are you?” Harris said as the woman introduced the vice president to her husband, Henry. “Hi, Henry. Kamala Harris,” the vice president said. “Very nice to meet you.”\n\nThe woman asked Harris how she is doing.\n\n“You know – it’s the day before the election,” Harris said. “I just wanted to come by and ask for your vote.”\n\n“Well, you got my vote already,” the woman said, adding her husband plans to vote Tuesday.\n\nAt another home, a man answered and introduced himself as Cole. “Cole, that’s our son’s name!” Harris said as she shook his hand.\n\nThe Harris campaign has boasted about dwarfing Trump in the ground game. Over the weekend, more than 90,000 Harris volunteers took part in get-out-the-vote activities, the campaign said, including knocking on more than 3 million doors across the seven battleground states.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nHarris: 'Momentum is on our side'\n\nVice President Kamala Harris said momentum in her campaign will catapult her to the presidency.“Tomorrow is Election Day and the momentum is on our side,” Harris said during her rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key swing state.Harris said that her campaign tapped into the “ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams” of the American people, adding that it’s time for a new generation of leadership in the United States.“I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States,” Harris said.But she urged those who have not voted to make sure to cast their ballots, saying “we must finish strong.”“Make no mistake, we will win,\" she said.- Rebecca Morin\n\nTrump says Jill Stein may be one of his 'favorite' politicians\n\nDonald Trump again voiced his liking for Stein, the Green Party’s presidential candidate, at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pa.\n\n“I love the Green Party. Jill Stein…I never met her, but she may be one of my favorite politicians,” Trump told his supporters.\n\nHe previously said at a rally in June that he likes Stein “very much.”\n\nMany critics have said that Stein could act as a spoiler for Democrats and help Trump. In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times last month, Stein dismissed those concerns and said that “those conversations never go anywhere.”\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nVance bashes Biden’s garbage comment, calls Harris ‘trash’\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee JD Vance in Atlanta on Monday criticized Kamala Harris over a remark made last week by her boss, President Joe Biden. In a video call last Tuesday, Biden had referred to Trump supporters as “garbage.”\n\nThe Republican vice-presidential candidate used the moment to knock Harris.\n\n“And I want to ask us not to follow Kamala Harris’ terrible example, because I’m sure that everyone single one of us, all of us gathered here, know somebody planning to vote the wrong way tomorrow,” Vance told the crowd. “... Here in our movement, we love every citizen of this country.”\n\nVance soon followed this criticism with a bit of his own trash talk.\n\n“In two days, we are going to take out the trash in Washington, D.C., and the trash’s name is Kamala Harris,” he said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nHarris campaign touts ‘multiple paths’ to 270 electoral votes\n\nOn the eve of Election Day, the Harris campaign said Monday that all seven battleground states remain in play for the Democratic nominee, insisting the vice president doesn’t have to rely on the “blue wall” path for victory.\n\n“We truly believe that we have multiple paths to 270 electoral votes,” Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a call with reporters. “Sometimes when you get to this stage of the race, or even sooner, you often have to close out a pathway, or a state might not be in play. We are not seeing that at all.”\n\nAll seven of the top battlegrounds are margin-of-error races, polling has consistently showed.\n\nThe clearest path to victory for Harris has long been sweeping the three Rust Belt “blue wall” states that Biden carried in 2020: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. Doing so would likely give Harris enough electoral votes to win the election even if she were to lose Arizona, Nevada, Georgia and North Carolina.\n\nBut if Harris loses one of the “blue wall” states, she would need to offset the loss with wins among the four Sun Belt states. And Harris would need to win two Sun Belt states if she wins Michigan and Wisconsin, but loses Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes up for grabs.\n\n“We obviously see that the’ blue wall’ has often been the most straightforward path to get to 270, but we equally see favorable results and numbers in all the Sun Belts,” said O’Malley Dillon.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance encourages Georgians to vote 10 times ‘the legal way’\n\nUsing one of his repeated rally lines, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance told a crowd of supporters in Atlanta on Monday evening to vote for Trump 10 times – legally.\n\n“Here is the legal way. The legal way to vote ten times is to get your friends to the polls and take yourself to the polls and get nine of your friends and family to go along with you,” Vance said.\n\nVance noted the Peach State’s tight margin of victory four years ago. In 2020, President Biden won Georgia by less than 12,000 votes. So far, the southern swing state has seen record-breaking early voting turnout.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump says Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live\n\nDonald Trump claimed at a rally in Reading, Pa., on Monday that Kamala Harris ‘copied’ his routine on Saturday Night Live after she came onto the show just three days before the Nov. 5 election.\n\n“She uses everything I do. She uses…even Saturday Night Live they copied. They copied. Think of that. Saturday, oh she was great on - they copied my routine, I did it a long time ago, they copied the same routine. I think I did it better, actually. I don’t think - I think anybody could’ve done it. I think anybody could’ve done it better,” Trump said.\n\nDuring the show, comedian Maya Rudolph, who portrayed Harris, spoke to the real Harris through an empty vanity mirror. The two wore a similar suit and necklace, and Harris offered campaign advice to Rudolph.\n\nIn 2015 on “The Tonight Show,” Trump and comedian Jimmy Fallon did something similar. Fallon portrayed Trump, who spoke to the real Republican presidential candidate through a vanity mirror. Both also wore matching suits.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nGeorgia Supreme Court cancels late-arriving absentee ballots for Cobb County\n\nThe Georgia Supreme Court on Monday canceled any late-arriving absentee ballots that a lower-court judge had ordered be provided to 3,000 Cobb County voters who never received them.\n\nThe ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center filed the lawsuit after the county in a 2024 battleground state announced it would be mailing thousands of absentee ballots late. Superior Judge Robert Flournoy ordered the county to overnight ballots to voters and allow them to be counted as late as Friday.\n\nBut the Republican National Committee appealed the order because it opposes counting votes that arrive after Election Day. The state Supreme Court ruled that all ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day on Tuesday, as required by state law. The high court ordered county officials to hold on to the late-arriving ballots in a sealed container until further notice from the court.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nRapper Fat Joe to undecided Puerto Rican, Latino voters: ‘Where is your pride?’\n\nRapper Fat Joe, who is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent, called on Monday for undecided Latino voters to remember the actions former President Donald Trump has taken against the community – from calling Mexicans “rapists” and “drug dealers” in 2016 to slow response to Puerto Rico after back-to-back hurricanes in 2017.\n\n“Where's your pride?” said Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, during Vice President Kamala Harris’ rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania. “If you're still out there talking about ‘you might be voting for somebody or you're not decided.’ Where's your pride as a Latino?”\n\nHarris stopped in Allentown, a city in Pennsylvania that has a large Puerto Rican and Latino population, in an appeal to voters in the key swing state.\n\n– Rebecca Morin\n\nHarris campaign bracing for Trump to again prematurely declare victory\n\nKamala Harris' president campaign on Monday warned that Republican Donald Trump might try to exploit 2024's late-counted votes to prematurely declare he won the election like he did four years ago.\n\n“We all know that it's going to take some time to get election results,” Dana Remus, the Harris campaign’s legal counsel, said in a call Monday with reporters. “We also all know that Trump will likely use this time to allege fraud, spread misinformation and claim premature victory.”\n\nPennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow the pre-canvassing of mail-in ballots until Election Day, meaning the process to count the ballots could drag past Tuesday in these key battleground states.\n\nJen O’Malley Dillon, chair of the Harris campaign, said it expects near-complete results from North Carolina and Georgia on election night but only partial results from Nevada, Wisconsin, Arizona and Pennsylvania. In Nevada, mail ballots are allowed to be counted if they come in by Nov. 9. And in Pennsylvania, provisional ballots aren’t counted until Nov. 8.\n\n“That's obviously not a sign of fraud. It's just the way it works,” O’Malley Dillon said. “We believe this race is going to be incredibly close. So we may not know the results of this election for several days, but we are very focused on staying calm and confident throughout this period as the process goes through.”\n\nIn the 2020 election, Trump falsely declared victory after in-person Election Day returns showed him leading in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. His leads vanished after mail-in ballots that skewed heavily toward Joe Biden were counted, propelling Biden to victory.\n\nIn a May interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a USA TODAY Network partner, Trump raised doubts about the 2024 election outcome. \"If everything's honest, I'd gladly accept the results,\" Trump said then. \"If it's not, you have to fight for the right of the country.\"\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nVance doubles down on anti-Harris message in last rally\n\nVance kicked off his final campaign stop Monday night by intensifying his criticism of Harris.\n\n“It’s the last day of the campaign, and I think today I’m just gonna say whatever the hell I want to,” Vance said in opening statements to a crowd of supporters in Newtown, Penn.\n\n“This is when I tell you what I really think of Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe GOP candidate called his Democratic opponent “a disaster,” adding that she should “go back to San Francisco where you belong.”\n\nVance later said he did have something nice to say about Harris: a backhanded compliment about her media appearances.\n\n“The one thing I’ll say nice about Kamala Harris is that every single time she gives an interview I think we gain about 50,000 votes,” Vance said.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nPennsylvania recount requests could prove ‘vexatious’: expert\n\nPennsylvania could be headed for a big recount. Or many little ones that a former judge says could prove “vexatious.”\n\nThe state is a key battleground where polls show a dead heat between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. State law calls for an automatic recount if the winning margin is less than 0.5%.\n\nThe state with 9.1 million voters has more than 9,000 voting precincts. Under a 1927 law, it only takes three voters in a precinct to pay $50 fee to request a recount from the county Court of Common Pleas – regardless of the margin of victory. Precincts are capped at 1,200 voters each, under state law.\n\nAfter a flurry of precinct recounts since 2020, the law was updated, according to experts at Keep Our Republic, an advocacy group in Pennsylvania. To force a broader county-level recount, the three voters requesting a recount would need to persuade a judge there was fraud or errors with computations on vote totals.\n\n“The bar is higher now if you want a broader recount. But the law itself allows for I think potentially vexatious behavior,” said John Jones, a former federal judge in Pennsylvania and a member of Keep Our Republic's advisory council in the state. “You should watch carefully in the week after the election, because there may be a number of petitions in counties and they would have to be adjudicated by the county court.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nImmigration takes center stage at Trump’s Pennsylvania rally\n\nDonald Trump continued to lean heavily into his anti-immigrant rhetoric at a rally in Reading, Pa., on the eve of Election Day, telling his supporters that Kamala Harris has “eradicated” the southern border.\n\n“They're taking over your towns, your schools, your hospitals,” Trump said, referring to migrants.\n\nHe later added that, “The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer.”\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, illegal border crossings reached record highs, averaging more than 2 million per year from 2021 to 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection. But more recently, illegal crossings – or “encounters” – at the southern border fell to the lowest total in nearly four years only months after Biden announced broad restrictions on asylum.\n\nTrump also claimed that migrant crime has been “as vicious as there's ever been.” But data analyzed between 2012 to 2022 found that undocumented immigrants have a homicide conviction rate 14% below that of native-born Americans. Immigrants have a 62% lower homicide rate and undocumented immigrants have a 41% lower total criminal conviction rate than native-born Americans.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi, Chris Mueller and Terry Collins\n\nTop US cybersecurity official: Election has 'never been more secure'\n\nTop U.S. cybersecurity director Jen Easterly said Monday that the 2024 elections are more secure than ever, and that local, state and federal election officials are on alert and ready to combat any domestic and foreign interference in the democratic process.\n\n“As we head into tomorrow, I can say with great confidence that our election infrastructure has never been more secure and that the election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free and fair elections,” Easterly, the director of the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nEasterly and top election security aide Cait Conley acknowledged that there have been “small scale” disturbances, including Russian disinformation videos, severe weather, vandalism to some ballot drop boxes and other incidents that have for the most part already been made public.\n\nBut, Easterly said, “At this point, we see no evidence of activity that has the potential to materially impact the outcome of the presidential election.”\n\nCISA officials, in tandem with other officials nationwide, have been conducting hundreds of table-top exercises in recent years to prepare for any eventuality, Easterly said. She said various forms of disruptions are expected to continue on Election Day and beyond.\n\n“It's important to remember that disruptions happen in every election, which is why election officials invest so much into incident response, preparation and contingency plans,” Easterly said.\n\n- Josh Meyer\n\nSpin the numbers: Trump aides express confidence\n\nElection Day is almost here - finally - so it's time for presidential campaigns to spin numbers and predict victory.\n\nThe Trump campaign put out a memo Monday claiming that, in battleground states, the women's vote and the urban vote are down (bad for Democrats) and the rural vote is up (good for Republicans).\n\nWe'll see when states start counting votes on Tuesday night.\n\nDemocrats - who say the numbers overall favor Harris - suspect that Trump is preparing to declare victory before all the key states are called, the better to sow confusion when legal challenges commence.\n\nTrump aides said a premature declaration won't be necessary - the former president is going to win it outright.\n\n\"We will declare victory when we are confident that we have the 270 electoral votes that we need,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters gathered for a Monday rally in Raleigh, N.C. \"The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nVideo: RNC official debunks myth about noncitizen voting\n\nImmigrants here illegally aren’t likely to be registered to vote in Pennsylvania because they don’t have drivers licenses or Social Security numbers, an official with the Republican National Committee said in a video first obtained by ProPublica.\n\nJoe Neild made the comments on one of the Republican Party’s election integrity calls. The party holds them often in battleground states to train poll workers and poll watchers. In the video, an unnamed participant asks Neild, “How do you know if they are illegal aliens? How can you spot that?”\n\n“If they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be inside the pollbook, because if they’re illegal aliens, they’re not going to be able to register to vote because they’ll need a drivers license number or a Social Security number,” Neild said. He said Pennsylvania requires proof of citizenship in order to get a drivers license.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Republican National Committee for comment. A voicemail left for Neild was not immediately returned.\n\nBrian Hughes, a senior advisor for Trump campaign, told USA TODAY that the party worker was training poll watchers appropriately about what their role is and isn’t. “One of the things you can’t do is become an enforcement mechanism in whether or not someone is a citizen to vote,” Hughes said.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\n'F around and find out': Philly DA delivers harsh warning against election interference\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner delivered a stern warning on Monday for anyone who plans to interfere or intimidate voters on Election Day after concerns of \"frivolous, bogus, challenges\" being brought to eligible voters.\n\n\"Everybody in this city is working and has been working for months to make sure that there will be nothing tough about (voting) and nothing to fear in that experience,\" he said.\n\nKrasner added: \"But I also wanna be clear, anybody who thinks it's time to play militia, F around and find out. Anybody who thinks it's time to insult, to deride, to mistreat, to threaten people, F around and find out. We do have the cuffs, we do have the jail cells, we do have the Philly juries, and we do have the state prisons. So if you're going to try and turn an election into some form of coercion, if you're going to try and bully people, bully votes or voters, try to erase votes, try any of that nonsense, we're not playing. F around and find out.\"\n\nKrasner literally said the letter \"F,\" pronounced \"eff,\" not the actual curse word.\n\nVoters are encouraged to contact the Election Protection hotline, a national, nonpartisan service should they encounter any voting irregularities: 866-OUR-VOTE.\n\nKrasner gave a final message to those intending to disrupt election proceedings: \"You can have your fun in a jail cell, because that's what's coming.\"\n\n-Sam Woodward\n\nWhen will election results be announced?\n\nDo not expect final results on Election Night.\n\nElection workers have never completed ballot counting on Election Day at any point in the country's history. This year, local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nIn recent decades, news outlets have typically called the presidential race late on election night or the morning after, with two notable exceptions. In 2000, a famously close race and legal challenges dragged out the process — things likely to affect this year's cycle. In 2020, a rise in mail-in ballots during the COVID pandemic delayed results.\n\nThis year, state laws still in place in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin prohibiting election workers from counting early votes until Election Day are expected to delay results again.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nNorth Carolina sets record turnout in early voting despite hurricane damage\n\nNearly 4.5 million ballots in North Carolina were cast during early voting that ended Saturday, a new high-water mark above the 3.6 million cast during early voting in 2020, officials said.\n\nHurricane Helene heavily damaged 25 counties in the western part of the state. But turnout in those counties was 2 percentage points higher than in the rest of the rest, according to the state Board of Elections\n\nKaren Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state board of elections, called the workers and voters in the western counties “an inspiration to us all.”\n\nThe turnout included 4.2 million people who voted early in person and about 250,000 absentee ballots.\n\nAbout 57% of registered voters statewide have cast ballots. Up to another 1.5 million people are expected to vote on Election Day, according to Bob Phillips, the state’s executive director of Common Cause, a voting-rights advocacy group.\n\n“This has been a historic voter turnout for North Carolina,” Phillips said. “We’ve seen a lot of enthusiasm.”\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nFBI unveils election command post\n\nThe FBI has reported some foreign cyber-attacks during early voting in the 2024 election, but officials said it was not a major increase from 2020 as the agency opened its command post to respond to coordinate its response to election threats with other federal agencies, state and local authorities.\n\n“The threat reporting we’re getting in here is not a huge volume increase, but people are more aware of reporting information to the FBI,” James Barnacle, deputy assistant director of the FBI's criminal investigative division, told reporters during a tour Monday. “We have had some foreign malign influence operations and some attempted cyber attacks where adversaries are trying to hit the secretaries of state or state governments or local governments and cause issues with their infrastructure.”\n\nRussia, China and Iran are trying to influence the election, he said. For example, a video circulating in late October falsely portrayed the destruction of ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which federal officials labeled a Russian hoax.\n\nThe FBI election command office has about 80 people from 12 agencies on hand at any time from agencies including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Secret Service; the postal inspection service, the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department. The office opened on Friday and will remain open until at least Nov. 9.\n\n“This command post is a little more robust than it’s been in the past,” Barnacle said.\n\n-Bart Jansen\n\nSecret Service prepare Washington and Florida for Election Day\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service is working to secure locations in the nation's capital and Palm Beach County, Florida, where Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump will be on election night, respectively.\n\nThe agency said it is working with federal, state, and local partners to ensure heightened levels of safety. Fencing and other physical public safety measures will be installed around the White House, National Observatory, and the Palm Beach County Convention Center.\n\n\"These enhancements are not in response to any specific issue but are part of wide-ranging public safety preparations for Tuesday's election,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service said in a statement to USA TODAY.\n\n-Rachel Barber\n\nMusk Super PAC argues his $1 million giveaway not a lottery, DA says it’s illegal\n\nElon Musk's pro-Trump Super PAC picks winners of its $1 million-a-day giveaway based on who would be good spokespeople for its agenda and not registered voters at random, a lawyer for the tech billionaire said in court on Monday.\n\nChris Gober, a lawyer for Musk’s PAC political action committee made that argument in an effort to persuade a Pennsylvania judge that the giveaway was not an \"illegal lottery,\" as Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner alleges in a lawsuit seeking to block the payments ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election.\n\nIn response, Krasner took the stand to say the $1 million daily giveaways in the seven swing states expected to decide the election were indeed an illegal lottery. He also told Judge Angelo Foglietta that some Pennsylvania residents had been \"scammed for their information\" and called the giveaway a \"grift\" aimed at political marketing.\n\nIn his initial giveaways, Musk described it as a lottery-like system but changed the public messaging after legal experts – and, reportedly, the Justice Department – raised questions about its legality.\n\n\"There is no prize to be won, instead recipients must fulfill contractual obligations to serve as a spokesperson for the PAC,\" Gober said in the hearing before Foglietta.\n\nThe hearing in the key swing state comes just one day before Musk’s favored candidate Trump faces off against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in a tightly contested race.\n\n−Josh Meyer and Reuters\n\nFew problems with early voting: expert\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department election lawyer who is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said there were no significant problems with early voting such as voter intimidation or violent confrontations.\n\n“Election officials prepared for anything and everything,” Becker said. “But we saw no real issues.”\n\nWith about 80 million early votes cast, Becker said only isolated incidents were reported, such as a man with a machete was reported in Florida.\n\nMistakes that Becker described as normal included a shortage of staffers to handle mail ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania; an estimated 13,000 to 17,000 voters in Erie County, Pennsylvania, not receiving absentee ballots; and about 3,000 voters in Cobb County, Georgia, who didn’t get ballots. In each case, courts granted extra time for voters to receive and then return ballots.\n\n“This is normal,” Becker said. “This has been handled appropriately.”−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump jokes that Joe Biden likes him more than Kamala Harris\n\nDonald Trump at his rally in North Carolina on Monday morning said that Joe Biden said he liked Trump more than Kamala Harris. Minutes later he clarified that the comment was a joke.\n\n“Here’s news it’s breaking today. Sleepy Joe Biden has announced officially that he likes Trump more than he likes Kamala,” Trump said. The crowd roared with cheers.\n\nLater in his speech, Trump said he was “only kidding about Joe.”\n\n“He didn't officially say that,” Trump said. “When I say it's official. No, no, I'm only kidding.”\n\nBiden has made no such announcement. The president endorsed Harris after he stepped out of the 2024 race in July and has been a vocal supporter of Harris’ campaign ever since.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nNonpartisan election expert warns against Russian disinformation videos\n\nDavid Becker, director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, urged voters Monday to be skeptical of any videos that could be Russian disinformation aimed at dividing Americans in the wake of the presidential election.\n\nOne recent example is a viral video showing mail ballots destroyed in Pennsylvania, which federal investigators said was a Russian hoax.\n\n\"We're going to see a lot of that,\" Becker warned. \"Any videos you see -- vote flipping, people claiming to have committed voter fraud, people claiming that voter fraud was rampant because of what they saw someone else do. Everyone should be wary of any videos or claims made on social media, the Russians are behind a lot of this.\"\n\nThe federal government has been acting quickly to identify which videos were made by Russians to influence the election, he added.\n\n\"It's clearly designed to incite anger on the part of supporters of a losing candidate and divide us as a nation and make us hate our fellow Americans.\"\n\n-Riley Beggin\n\nTrump promises new tariff, this time on Mexico\n\nDonald Trump vowed to immediately enact a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico during a rally in Raleigh, N.C. on Monday as punishment if the country doesn’t help the U.S. decrease the flow of immigration.\n\nTrump argued the proposal has an “100% chance of working” because if the 25% tariff doesn’t work, he’ll squeeze the country with a 50% or 75% tariff.\n\nIf elected, Trump has proposed enacting a variety of other tariffs, which act as taxes on imported goods, including a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on goods from around the world.\n\nThe policies are designed to bolster U.S. manufacturing, but economists have said the proposals would raise prices on U.S. consumers and reduce economic growth by leading to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\nTariffs on Mexico could have a widespread impact, as Mexico is the No. 1 trading partner for the U.S.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nSenate polling roundup: Democrats retain advantage in toss-up races, though Republicans have edge on retaking chamber\n\nA wave of polling released Monday and over the weekend continue to show Republicans with an edge on retaking the U.S. Senate. Democrats retain an advantage in key battleground states.\n\nThe Cook Political Report has named Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin the four toss-up Senate races. All these seats are currently held by Democrats.\n\nFive new polls from Pennsylvania give Democratic Sen. Bob Casey a 1- to 5-point lead in the Keystone State, while one poll indicates the race is tied and one gives GOP challenger David McCormick a 1-point lead.\n\nTwo new Michigan polls found the race between former GOP Rep. Mike Rogers and Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is tied. Four polls gave Slotkin a lead between 2 and 8 percentage points, while one gave Rogers a 1-point lead.\n\nFour new polls from Wisconsin give incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin a 1- to 6-point lead, while one poll indicates she is tied with GOP challenger Eric Hovde. One poll gives Hovde a 1-point lead.\n\nAnd in Ohio -- the toss-up state recognized as most likely to flip to Republicans -- one new poll showed Sen. Sherrod Brown's opponent, Bernie Moreno, with a 1-point lead.\n\nArizona and Nevada are expected to slightly favor Democrats, and new polls indicate that is still the case. In Nevada, three polls say Democratic incumbent Sen. Jacky Rosen has a 2- to 9-point advantage over Republican candidate Sam Brown, while one has the race tied.\n\nIn Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Reuben Gallego is running against former TV anchor Kari Lake, four new polls gave Gallego a 2- to 8-point advantage.\n\nTo retake control of the chamber, Republicans only need to flip two seats. They've already got one in the bag: West Virginia, as Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring and a Republican is sure to win his spot.\n\nDemocrats are hoping they can make up for potential losses in Ohio and Montana by beating vulnerable Republicans in Florida and Texas. But two new polls from Morning Consult found voters preferred incumbent Republican Sens. Rick Scott in Florida and Ted Cruz in Texas by 3 percentage points each.\n\nYou can read more about each of these polls in detail here.\n\n−Riley Beggin\n\nHow to follow results on election night\n\nYou can follow along with the USA TODAY Network's hub, which will show election results as they are coming in from around the country especially in critical swing states that could determine the outcome of the campaign between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nIt will also feature the dozens of House and Senate races that will also determine who controls Congress.Live results and analysis will also be featured on USATODAY.com, along with our livestream.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the Associated Press will also offer a digital livestream of Tuesday night's US presidential election results. The inaugural AP VoteCast broadcast will include expert discussions, live vote counts and electoral map updates every 30 minutes, as well as rallies, and results from over 35 cameras nationwide.\n\n–Josh Meyer\n\nIs New Hampshire in play for Trump?\n\nRepublican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance diverged from his usual swing state stops on Sunday to rally support in New Hampshire just two days before the presidential election.\n\nHe predicted a Trump victory in the New England state, which has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 2004. Although, Trump did come close to flipping the state with a libertarian reputation in 2016.\n\n“What we’re doing is expanding the map,” Vance said. “I believe in two days; we will turn New Hampshire red.”\n\nBut Trump winning New Hampshire is still a long shot. A recent Saint Anselm College survey of New Hampshire voters showed Harris leading Trump by 5 points, 51%-46%.\n\n– Margie Cullen and Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump escalates violent rhetoric toward media at Pennsylvania rally Sunday\n\nDonald Trump said during a Sunday rally in Pennsylvania that a potential assassin would have to shoot through the news media to hit him.\n\nIn a wide-ranging speech Sunday morning in which he also repeated unfounded claims about voter fraud, Trump ramped up his rhetoric against journalists. Pointing to the protective glass surrounding him, he said, “To get me, somebody would have to shoot through the fake news. And I don’t mind that so much. I don’t mind that.”\n\nTrump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said the president's comments weren't about the press, but instead about his own personal safety in light of the two assassination attempts against him earlier this year.\n\nTrump's comments come as both presidential campaigns have received criticism in recent days for heightened, and at times violent, political rhetoric. Last week, Trump suggested that rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., who has endorsed Harris and become one of the former president's most vocal GOP critics.\n\n– Josh Meyer and Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen will we know the results on Election Day?\n\nDon't expect final results on election night. Local and state certification deadlines range from two days to more than a month after Nov. 5.\n\nAn increase in mail-in ballots amid the COVID pandemic delayed results in 2020. It took four days for votes to be counted and for news outlets to call the race for President Joe Biden. In 2016, the race was called for Donald Trump in the early hours of the next morning.\n\nIt is unclear how long vote counting will take this year, but legal challenges may also drag out the process of confirming a winner, as they did in the 2000 election.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat time do the polls open and close?\n\nMost states will allow voters to cast their ballots between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. on Election Day. However, polling hours on Nov. 5 will vary by locations.\n\nFor example, in some areas of Vermont, polls will open as early as 5 a.m. and in New York, polls will close as late as 9 p.m. Check with your state or local election office or its website to find the correct time to vote in your area.\n\nUSA TODAY’s Voter Guide details everything you need to know about making sure your voice is heard in this year’s general election.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nWhat companies are offering Election Day deals?\n\nRideshare companies Uber and Lyft are offering discounted trips for voters, while Hertz has a car rental deal, should you need some transportation to the polls on Nov. 5.\n\nSome restaurants are also offering freebies, including Krispy Kreme, which will hand out free Original Glazed doughnuts and \"I Voted\" stickers at participating U.S. locations on Election Day.\n\nIf voters are still hungry as they wait for results to roll in, Grubhub+ members will have access to an array of discounted deals and Uber Eats is offering 25% off on Election Night orders.\n\n– Mike Snider and Rachel Barber\n\nTrump reportedly gets FCC 'equal time' after Kamala Harris appears on NBC’s 'SNL'\n\nNBC filed a notice with the Federal Communications Commission saying it would provide former President Donald Trump with \"equal time\" following a brief appearance by Vice President Kamala Harris on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nHarris appeared on the sketch comedy show Saturday in a skit offering advice in the mirror to comedian Maya Rudolph, who has played Harris in the leadup to the election.\n\nFollowing her brief appearance, Republican FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr posted on X that it was a \"clear and blatant effort to evade the FCC's Equal Time rule.\" The Trump appointee suggested NBC should offer equal time to \"other qualifying campaigns.\"\n\nIn the notice filed Sunday, NBC said Harris appeared \"without charge\" on \"SNL\" for 1 minute and 30 seconds. In response, NBC provided Trump airtime Sunday, allowing him to directly address viewers during the NASCAR 2024 Cup playoff race, CNN's Brian Stelter reported.\n\nThe FCC's equal time rule requires American radio and television broadcast stations to provide equal access to competing political candidates.

However, after backlash from a Trump rally speaker’s statement against Puerto Rico and a new poll showing Harris has a chance in red Iowa, Trump is now standing at –138 and Harris at +120.\n\nOther betting odds have similarly tightened.\n\nThe betting favorite has only lost twice since 1866, according to the Conversation, a nonprofit news organization.\n\n-- James Powel and Rachel Barber\n\nLatest New York Times/Siena poll shows Trump, Harris deadlocked in key states\n\nWith just hours until Election Day, polls are continuing to show a tight presidential race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump\n\nSwing state polls published by the New York Times and Sienna College on Sunday showed Kamala Harris narrowly ahead in Nevada, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Georgia, while Trump led in Arizona. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania and Michigan, two pivotal blue wall states, Harris and Trump were locked in a dead heat.\n\nBut the results in every state were within the survey’s margin of error of ±3.5%, meaning the leads could be statistical errors and aren’t definite. Both candidates are counting on winning a combination of the seven swing states to get them to 270 electoral votes in the electoral college.\n\n-- Karissa Waddick\n\nAre banks open on election day?\n\nBranches of Bank of America, Truist, PNC, Capital One, Wells Fargo and other banks will be open their regular hours on Tuesday, Nov. 5.\n\nOther banking services, such as ATMs and online banking, should also be available as usual on Election Day.\n\n-- Gabe Hauari\n\nIs election day a federal holiday?\n\nElection Day is not a federal holiday.\n\nSome states do, however, observe Election Day as a holiday.

In the afternoon, he's holding two Pennsylvania rallies: One in Reading and one in Pittsburgh.\n\nIn the evening, Trump will wrap up the day with a stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKamala Harris schedule for Monday\n\nOn Monday, Kamala Harris will wrap up the campaign in Pennsylvania by holding rallies in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, followed by a concert in Allentown featuring rapper Fat Joe and a performance by Frankie Negron, both of whom have Puerto Rican heritage.\n\nCampaign officials say the rally aims to mobilize the Latino community in the Keystone State to get out and vote.\n\n− Terry Moseley", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2024/11/06/donald-trump-presidency-impact-detroit-three-automakers-uaw-car-buyers-ev/76088343007/", "title": "Experts: Trump presidency may help Detroit automakers, cost car ...", "text": "As if the U.S. auto industry's transition to electric vehicles hasn't been rocky enough, President-elect Donald Trump's victory over Democratic rival Kamala Harris adds uncertainty to the Detroit Three's push toward an all-electric future, industry watchers said.\n\nStill, some say the domestic automakers will see some wins from Trump taking over. For example, he is expected to ease some of the environmental regulations that have pressured the Detroit Three to make a fast push toward EV adoption.\n\nBut it's a mixed bag because Trump has also set his sights on scaling back or eliminating EV initiatives. Auto analysts said it would be difficult for him to completely gut President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act initiatives, but through executive orders, Trump could defund or limit some of the EV subsidies included there. Many parts of the IRA, such as expanding EV charger infrastructure, were in place to help the Detroit Three encourage EV adoption.\n\nAdd to that the impact of Trump's promise to impose bigger tariffs to imported goods. Sure, that keeps cheap Chinese vehicles off U.S. shores. But it also could affect parts and U.S.-brand cars built elsewhere, such as in Mexico, and could lead to higher new-vehicle prices — just when sky-high sticker prices were finally cooling off and keeping demand for new vehicles stable, experts said Wednesday.\n\nThen there is the union. While UAW members were divided in their support for Trump and Harris, President Shawn Fain endorsed Harris and vocalized his disdain for Trump. Trump is likely to be unfriendly in return, which some say plays to Fain's own combative style.\n\nAll in all, expert forecasters, such as Cox Automotive, predict U.S. auto sales will hold up and finish the year up 2% with 15.7 million new vehicle sales this year compared with 2023, regardless of the upcoming U.S. leadership change.\n\n\"Presidents come and go, but the auto industry motors on,\" Mark Schirmer, director of Industry Insights & Corporate Communications at Cox Automotive, said in a Wednesday morning newsletter.\n\nAutos 'one of the biggest beneficiaries' of the Trump win\n\nSome analysts say the Trump win is a boon for the Detroit auto industry. Higher tariffs — which are the taxes put on goods that cross national borders — would keep the Chinese from flooding the U.S. market with cheaper EVs than U.S. automakers offer.\n\nTrump has promised to scale back or eliminate many of the Environmental Protection Agency's emissions standards as well as incentives to promote production and adoption of EVs. Some experts said less regulation would ease carmakers' costs.\n\n\"I think autos are among the biggest beneficiaries — not sure why more people aren’t talking about it,\" Michael Ward, managing director of research for Freedom Capital Markets, told the Detroit Free Press of Trump's victory. \"Five things I looked at: Lower fuel is always good news for the autos, less inflation from the lower fuel prices leading to lower interest rates ... autos (are) among the most capital-intensive industries and lower rates benefit the consumer.\"\n\nWard said he also expects personal and business taxes to go down, giving consumers more purchasing power.\n\nBank of America Securities analyst John Murphy also said in a Wednesday investor note cited by CNBC that General Motors and Ford will be \"the main beneficiaries from the Trump administration.\" He cited the Biden-Harris \"environmental regime\" as pressuring the core business of the automakers to \"decarbonize by the end of the decade while shifting quickly to an EV portfolio.”\n\nThe impact of tariffs for buyers and carmakers\n\nMany of the industry experts also see some uncertainty under a Trump presidency.\n\n\"It’s very mixed in terms of the implications in this 313 area code,\" Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, told the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday.\n\nUnder Trump, Ives agreed there will be less pressure for GM, Ford and Stellantis — which makes Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Fiat brands — to continue pursuing a speedy EV transition. But while tariffs will keep the Chinese out, tariffs also complicate the supply chain of auto parts imported to the states.\n\nPut another way: \"Tariffs will lead to more jobs for U.S. workers at component suppliers and higher costs for car buyers, who already suffer from sticker shock,\" said Erik Gordon, business professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. \"People will keep cars longer, and that will be good for the replacement parts and service industries.\"\n\nOthers doubt that Trump will put large tariffs on every imported vehicle. Morningstar Autos Analyst David Whiston told the Free Press that large tariffs on all imports would violate the USMCA agreement for Canadian and Mexican production. That would severely hurt American automakers, especially GM and Stellantis, who make some of their pickups in Mexico, he said. Ford also makes cars in Mexico.\n\n\"I don’t think Trump would do tariffs (that) will hurt the Detroit Three, at least not severely,\" Whiston said in an email Wednesday. \"Things like the steel tariffs that took low billion-dollar profit amounts from earnings years back are probably a bigger tariff threat than one on all vehicle exports to the U.S.\"\n\nHe said China tariffs for now won’t make a big impact because few Chinese-made vehicles are imported currently.\n\nJoe McCabe, CEO of AutoForecast Solutions, told the Free Press that tariffs are not a long-term solution to building a domestic economy and manufacturing base, noting that tariffs become a tax on the consumer and ultimately prices go up. He pointed to an argument that the 60-year old “Chicken Tax” — a 25% tariff on imported light trucks imposed over European tariffs on American chicken — helped create Detroit automakers' truck dominance. But in doing so, it gave domestic-built trucks a monopoly, making them too expensive without competition.\n\n\"With that said, (the tariff strategy) is currently the only hammer in the U.S. toolbox until we find a more balanced solution,\" McCabe said. \"The goal is to buy time for our domestic market to improve efficiencies and competitive priced products.\"\n\nTrump impact on EV adoption\n\nOne of the first things Trump will likely do is revoke the $7,500 EV tax credit offered to buyers of EVs, Wedbush's Ives said. That would not only be \"a gut punch to the EV initiatives\" of the Detroit Three, but it would give EV-sales leader Tesla an advantage. Tesla, led by Trump ally Elon Musk, does not need the tax credit as much as GM and Ford does, Ives said, because Tesla has the sales volume to lower prices and other cost advantages.\n\nBut Whiston said axing the EV tax credits would be tough because they are statute as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Also, if the credits went away or got much harder to obtain, it hurts every EV maker, Whiston said.\n\n\"Though it hurts Tesla the least because they have a deep cost advantage in EV production versus legacy automakers,\" Whiston said.\n\nTrump has promised Musk a quasi-Cabinet position. Musk's access to the White House does not bode well for the Detroit carmakers, Ives said.\n\nBut there is a catch. Trump has said he won't allow California to require that all vehicles in the state go electric in a decade. With Trump's pal Musk running the world's most valuable EV company, Trump's anti-EV stance might soften.\n\n\"A rising tide raises all boats. So to the extent that Elon is able to hamper the vilification of EVs by a potential Trump administration, all the better,\" James Chen, former head of policy for Rivian and Tesla, told Reuters.\n\nWayne State University business professor Marick Masters said that ultimately Trump will want to grow jobs in manufacturing generally and motor vehicle and parts specifically.\n\n\"Since June of this year, US manufacturing has lost nearly 150,000 jobs and the auto industry (vehicles and parts) has lost over 30,000 jobs,\" Masters said. \"His policies will focus on lowering the cost of doing business and pushing China to engage in more 'fair' trade policies.\"\n\nU-M's Gordon believes that Trump will warm up to EVs, as long as they are U.S.-made.\n\n\"But he is unlikely to push them via regulation,\" Gordon said.\n\nEV industry responds\n\nTrump has made it clear that he wants to reduce or cut vehicle electrification mandates, saying consumers should drive the market. Masters predicts that a major shift will occur in policy, but it will give automakers more flexibility in transitioning to EVs.\n\nThe problem is that carmakers have invested billions to transition to EVs and they can't just \"pivot on a dime\" to change course, McCabe said.\n\n\"A balanced portfolio approach needs to be the direction,\" McCabe said. \"Growth in electrification (not just battery electric vehicles) with less punitive actions and longer carbon footprint targets need to be considered. Extended-range options in pickup trucks, for example, help a consumer determine if a plug is not a disruptor in their lives. Trump has always had California in his sights, but it will not be a stroke of a pen to change their ZEV mandates.\"\n\nSteven Greenhouse, a longtime labor writer at The New York Times and currently a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, noted that Trump “seemingly moderated his antipathy to EVs as he sidled up to Musk” during the campaign, but that he might still try to pull EV subsidies, “and that would certainly mess up Detroit's automakers' plans — and probably hurt many autoworkers.”\n\nElectric Drive Transportation Association President Genevieve Cullen said in a statement Wednesday that the group will continue to work with both parties to \"secure the economic and environmental opportunities presented by electric drive technologies.\"\n\nCullen said more than 130 EV models are currently available with nearly 6 million sold and 362 companies investing $320 billion in the U.S. EV market. Last year, the electrified vehicle segment — which includes hybrids, plug-in hybrids, all-electric EVs and fuel cell vehicles — supported 373,605 jobs in America, she said. Cullen noted another 850,000 anciliary jobs supported the EV industry.\n\n“Electrification is the future of transportation, and our nation cannot cede the opportunity to lead in this critical market,\" Cullen said.\n\nFederal regulations likely to be affected\n\nOne other area of the auto industry where a second Trump administration could have a big impact is in safety regulations.\n\nMichael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, which advocates for improved vehicle safety and fuel efficiency, said he expects the auto industry will be pleased with what is likely on the way at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\n“If the first Trump presidency is any indication, we will see NHTSA’s now-active rulemaking division come to a screeching halt. I think we only saw two relatively minor final rules make it across the finish line from 2017-2020 in Trump’s first term, whereas the Biden NHTSA has been far more active in rulemaking efforts,” Brooks said, noting that that dozens of rules are in the review process. “Most of those rulemaking efforts will be hitting wet concrete under the Trump administration, including important rules on impaired driving tech, pedestrian protection, autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems. Also likely would be attempted rollbacks of fuel economy standards and electric vehicle policy.”\n\nNHTSA’s work related to vehicle recalls is also likely to be affected. Brooks noted that under the previous Trump administration, the agency’s defect investigations were near “all-time lows,” which made it difficult to uncover defects and influence safety recalls. That stands in contrast to the agency’s current “far more active” work to pursue defect investigations and see them through to timely conclusions, he said.\n\n“If Trump follows through on making Elon Musk a leader in the administration, we could also see NHTSA enforcement investigations influenced, particularly those involving Tesla, which is currently facing an investigation into the capabilities of its 'Full Self-Driving' tech,” Brooks said of Musk.\n\nThe UAW and a 'new reality of American politics'\n\nU-M's Gordon said that while UAW members have had mixed support for Harris and Trump, \"Shawn Fain is going to be happy as a clam because Trump is a useful target for (Fain's) retro 'us versus them' name-calling style. Fain does better with a good enemy than he does with a friend.\"\n\nIn a statement to the news media Wednesday, Fain said regardless of who is president, UAW members continue to face \"unchecked corporate greed destroying\" lives by shipping jobs overseas to boost shareholder profits.\n\n\"We’ve said all along that no matter who is in the White House, our fight remains the same. The fight to fix our broken trade laws like the USMCA continues,\" Fain said. \"The fight for good union jobs and U.S. leadership in the emerging battery industry continues. The fight for a secure retirement for everyone in this country continues. The fight for a living wage, affordable health care and time for our families continues. It's time for Washington, D.C., to put up or shut up, no matter the party, no matter the candidate.\"\n\nFain said the key issue facing autoworkers is if the government will \"stand with the working class, or keep doing the bidding of the billionaires.\"\n\nWayne State's Masters said this election represents a continuing realignment of the political parties, eroding some of the union's past political prowess.\n\n\"The Republican Party has the chance to expand its base as the party of the working class across gender and race, literally turning the parties upside from their positions since the New Deal,\" Masters said, \"In this transition, organized labor has much less of a political voice than it has in the past, due to declining ranks across numerous industries.\"\n\nMasters believes that Trump will appeal directly to unionized and nonunion employees, going over the heads of union leaders, calling it \"the new reality of American politics.\"\n\nGreenhouse, the former labor writer, said it’s not clear what a second Trump term will mean for the UAW, but it’s not likely to be good.\n\n“Considering how Trump has often talked of retribution against his critics, he may pressure some prosecutors to launch investigations of the UAW and Fain,” he said. “Trump will no doubt appoint a National Labor Relations Board that is more hostile, less friendly toward unions than Biden's NLRB, and that could make it harder for the UAW's ambitious plans to unionize more auto plants.”\n\nFor Bob King, what Trump’s win will mean for the UAW and labor does prompt some worries, in large part because of those who are believed to be advising Trump. King, who served as UAW president from 2010-14, pointed to Project 2025, the expansive conservative presidential transition playbook pushed by the Heritage Foundation.\n\n“I think every leader and activist in the labor movement is concerned about attacks on workers' rights to organize, workers' rights to collective bargaining, keeping jobs in this country,” he said, noting that in regard to Trump’s advisers, “I think everybody in the labor movement is very, very concerned about that.”\n\nThose plans “all sound pretty negative about unions and pretty opposed to unions,” he said.\n\nThe Detroit 3 react\n\nIn a statement, Ford spokeswoman Robyn Jackson said the company congratulates President-elect Trump and the newly elected officials across the government.\n\nFord will remain \"steadfast in our strategy to provide customers choice of gas, electric and hybrid vehicles,\" the statement said. \"We look forward to working with the new administration and Congress on policies that strengthen the U.S. automotive industry, which supports 9.7 million American jobs and drives more than $1 trillion into the economy each year.”\n\nMore:UAW's Fain says strike will cripple Stellantis\n\nMore:GM recalls some Chevy Bolts once again due to fire risk\n\nAt GM, spokeswoman Liz Winter said in a statement, \"We congratulate and look forward to working with the president-elect, Congress, and all elected officials to ensure that the U.S. continues to lead the world in technology and innovation, to the benefit of American workers and consumers alike.\"\n\nStellantis spokeswoman Shawn Morgan provided a statement, noting that \"Stellantis congratulates former President Donald J. Trump on being elected the 47th President of the United States. We look forward to working with President-elect Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive manufacturing base in the U.S.\"\n\nStellantis CEO Carlos Tavares has previously indicated the company would be prepared for whoever wins the election, but has acknowledged that the winner would likely affect the speed of a transition toward electrification.\n\n\"We are not assuming that the destination is going to change, we think electrification will go on,” Tavares said late last year.\n\nContact Jamie L.

He demanded probes of baseless election fraud claims in the 2020 race he lost. After leaving office, Trump faced prosecution in two federal cases for alleged election interference and mishandling classified documents.\n\nHere is a sample of candidates – from among lawmakers, members of his first administration and appointees – who are being considered, according to news reports and people working on the transition:\n\nTrump justice:Who will Donald Trump name as U.S. attorney general?\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nFormer Kamala Harris aide says Joe Biden should resign so she can serve as 47th president\n\nJamal Simmons, a former communications director for Kamala Harris, made an unlikely suggestion about how the vice president might still have a chance of becoming president in 2024: If Joe Biden steps down from office.\n\nAsked on Sunday what they thought would be the most important thing to watch for in the 71 days until President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, panelists on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Scott Jennings, Ashley Allison and Brad Todd pointed to the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza or Trump’s actions while setting up his administration.\n\nSimmons went in a different direction. Biden, he said, “could resign the presidency in the next 30 days (and) make Kamala Harris the president of the United States.”\n\n“Joe Biden’s been a phenomenal president,” Simmons said. “He’s lived up to so many of the promises he’s made. There’s one promise left that he can fulfill: being a transitional figure.”\n\n– George Fabe Russell\n\nMissouri Sen. Eric Schmitt pulls out of attorney general's race\n\nThe jockeying for jobs in the next Trump administration is well underway – and is starting to include the names of people who are pulling themselves out of the various races.\n\nFor example: Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., confirmed Monday he has asked Trump transition officials not to consider him for attorney general.\n\n\"I ran for the U.S. Senate to represent the people of the Show Me State and I’m just getting started,\" Schmitt said in a post on X.\n\nAmong the names thought to still be under consideration for the Justice Department: Mike Lee, a senator from Utah; John Ratcliffe, Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence, and Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump advised Putin not to escalate war with Ukraine\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and advised him not to escalate the Ukraine war, a source familiar with the conversation told Reuters on Sunday, as President Joe Biden plans to urge Trump not to abandon Kyiv.\n\nTrump and Putin spoke in recent days, said the source. Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday. Trump has criticized the scale of U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv, vowing to end the war quickly, without saying how.\n\n– Reuters\n\nStephen Miller named Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy\n\nDonald Trump has tapped Stephen Miller, one of his longest-serving top immigration advisers, as deputy chief of staff for policy in the incoming White House.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance congratulated Miller on his new role in a post on X after CNN first reported the move. \"This is another fantastic pick by the president,\" Vance said.\n\nMiller's appointment comes after Trump campaigned for president in 2024 on mobilizing mass deportations of undocumented immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nMiller, 39, served as senior advisor to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump’s immigration policies, which included separating migrant children from their families and a ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. Miller played a central role in Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump asks Mike Waltz to be national security adviser\n\nTrump has asked Florida congressman Mike Waltz to serve as his national security adviser, according to two sources familiar with his selection.\n\nWaltz, 50, is set join the new administration as it navigates several tense geopolitical fights, including the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars. The role Trump asked Waltz to serve in does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker has been a member of the House Armed Services Committee, served in civilian roles at the Pentagon and is a decorated Green Beret combat veteran. He's also an outspoken critic of the Defense Department’s diversity programs.\n\nIn Congress, Waltz has demanded more defense spending from NATO allies and questioned the United States’ “blank check” for Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson\n\nWho will control the House next year? What about the Senate?\n\nRepublicans will take control of the Senate from Democrats in 2025. They're expected to control the chamber 53-47, though one Senate race in Arizona hasn't formally been called.\n\nIn the House, either party would need 218 seats to take control of the chamber. Republicans are poised to reach that crucial number: Of the 435 seats in the House, 203 have been called for Democrats, and 213 have been called for Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump picks Tom Homan, former head of immigration enforcement, to be 'border czar'\n\nTom Homan, the former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will become a “border czar” overseeing deportation policy for undocumented immigrants and aviation security, President-elect Donald Trump announced.\n\nHoman was a controversial figure in Trump’s first term because he oversaw the “zero tolerance” policy that separated families of undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut he has been a vocal defender of strict immigration enforcement for Trump, who vowed a mass deportation of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants will begin on his first day in office Jan. 20.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Elise Stefanik?

During the hearing, she asked them whether calling for the genocide of Jews warranted disciplinary action.\n\nAll three presidents waffled and dodged the question, instead offering legal responses without directly condemning calling for the genocide of Jews.

But her resume is thinner than previous appointees to the U.N. job, which involves representing the United States at the Security Council and in delicate diplomatic negotiations with other world leaders.\n\nCritics say that while she is good at parroting talking points, Nauert does not have the kind of in-depth policy knowledge or political background needed for the job.\n\nNauert did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, nor did several White House spokesmen.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Nauert would replace Nikki Haley, Trump’s current ambassador to the U.N. and the former governor of South Carolina. Previous U.N. ambassadors include Adlai Stevenson, George H.W. Bush and Madeline Albright.\n\nBrett Bruen, who served as director of global engagement in the Obama administration, said Nauert has earned a reputation as \"a quick study\" and capable spokeswoman.\n\nBut \"the job of representing our country in the complex corridors of power at the United Nations requires more experience in negotiations and knowledge of international law than Heather brings,\" Bruen said last month, when Nauert first emerged as a frontrunner for the post. \"We need more than a smooth spokesperson. We need a seasoned, steady, and strong voice who understands the subtleties of multinational diplomacy.\"\n\nIn briefings from the State Department's podium, Nauert has rarely stumbled under sharp questioning by U.S. and foreign reporters. Her biggest gaffe may have come when she cited D-Day as evidence of the strong relationship between the United States and Germany.\n\n“Tomorrow is the anniversary of the D-Day invasion. We obviously have a very long history with the government of Germany, and we have a strong relationship with the government,” she said in June.\n\nPrior to joining the State Department, Nauert, a 48-year-old native of Illinois, was a reporter for “Fox & Friends” and served in several other positions at the cable network channel.\n\nMore:Nikki Haley, top Trump aide, will step down as United Nations ambassador at end of the year\n\nRelated:Nikki Haley: World leaders laughed at Trump because they love his honesty\n\nAs a journalist, Nauert covered the 9/11 terror attacks, the war in Iraq and four presidential elections.

Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again.”\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nDuring Trump’s first administration, four people served as White House Chief of Staff: Reince Priebus, John Kelly, Mick Mulvaney, and Mark Meadows.\n\nStephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy\n\nTrump is expected to name Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy. He previously served as a senior advisor to Trump and director of speechwriting during his first term. While Trump has not formally announced him as his pick, Vice President-elect JD Vance and Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser in the 2024 Trump campaign, congratulated Miller on Monday on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“This is another fantastic pick by the president,” Vance said.\n\nTom Homan to be considered as the ‘Border Czar’\n\nTom Homan will serve as the “border czar,” Trump announced Sunday, managing the country’s borders. He previously served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement from his first administration. Trump said on Truth Social that Homan’s position will manage “the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security.” Homan will prioritize deporting immigrants living in the United States without legal permission.\n\nMore:Who has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far? Latest staff selections include Rep. Mike Waltz\n\nElise Stefanik to be considered for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations\n\nU.S. House Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, will serve as Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, according to the president-election on Monday. The position was previously held by Nikki Haley, who Trump announced would not be invited to rejoin the administration. The congresswoman represents the Empire State's 21st Congressional District seat and is Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference. She assumed both roles in 2021, following the departure of former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming.\n\nStefanik will serve in the role as Trump has promised to Israel’s war in Gaza, as well as the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nMike Huckabee to be considered for U.S. ambassador to Israel\n\nTrump said on Tuesday he is going to nominate former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\nHuckabee, an evangelical Christian, is a staunch supporter of Israel and defender of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, considered illegal by most of the international community.\n\n\"He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nLee Zeldin to be considered for the Environmental Protection Agency\n\nTrump announced former House Representative Lee Zeldin of New York as his nomination for the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday. Zeldin served as New York’s 1st Congressional District from 20215 until 2023. He lost his race for governor against Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nZeldin is expected to help roll back many of the climate regulations set by the Biden administration as Trump pushes an expansion of fossil-fuel energy.\n\nKristi Noem to be considered for Homeland Security Secretary\n\nTrump has chosen South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to serve as the next Homeland Security Secretary, two sources familiar with the decision said on Tuesday.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is responsible for everything from border protection and immigration to disaster response and the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nWho will not be asked to join?\n\nIn addition to Nikki Haley, Trump announced that former director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo, will not be asked to join his second administration. His name was previously rumored to be floated as an option for the next secretary of defense.\n\nWho else is rumored to be nominated?\n\nSources told Reuters on Monday that Trump was expected to tap U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, R-Florida, as his secretary of state.\n\nReuters contributed to the reporting of this story.\n\nVictor Hagan is the Alabama Election Reporting Fellow for the USA TODAY Network.

Nikki Haley, left at the end of last year.\n\nTrump initially tapped Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman and former Fox News host, to replace Haley.

Trump's first U.N. ambassador, ex-South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, left at the end of last year.\n\nNauert has served as the State Department’s chief spokeswoman since April 2017, winning Trump over with her polished, camera-ready defense of his \"America First\" approach to foreign policy. She has also earned the trust of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, traveling the globe with the former Kansas congressman and ex-CIA director.\n\nBut experts noted that Nauert would have been one of the most inexperienced U.N. ambassadors in history – at a time of extreme flux in international relations. Since taking office, Trump has picked major foreign policy fights with key U.S. allies, including Canada and France, while praising authoritarian regimes in Russia, North Korea and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThere were \"significant concerns\" on Capitol Hill about her abilities to handle complex negotiations with other world powers, said Brett Bruen, a former State Department foreign service officer who served in the Obama administration on global engagement. \"Basically folks in the Senate couldn't see her doing battle successfully with the Russians (and the) Chinese.\"\n\nThe U.N. job involves representing the United States at the U.N. Security Council and in delicate diplomatic negotiations with other world leaders. Previous U.N. ambassadors include Adlai Stevenson, George H.W. Bush and Madeleine Albright.\n\n\"Her only real foreign policy is this stint at the State Department in a kind of spokesperson role,\" David Bosco, a professor of international relations at Indiana University, told USA TODAY when Trump first announced his choice of Nauert. \"As I look at who we have had in this position over the decades, I think Nauert would be one of the least prepared for this position.\"\n\nAlthough Trump announced Nauert's name in early December, the White House never formally submitted her nomination to the Senate. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, James Risch of Idaho, told USA TODAY in January he was ready to hold a confirmation hearing quickly on Nauert's bid.\n\nBut Risch noted then that the Senate had not gotten any formal notification of her candidacy. He said it was \"red tape\" that was holding up her bid, as opposed to any problems with her background check.\n\nBut Bloomberg news reported Nauert's nomination ran into trouble because she had hired a nanny who was in the U.S. legally but who did not have a work permit. The State Department press office did not immediately respond to a question about the Bloomberg report.\n\nIn its statement on Nauert's withdrawal, the State Department said Trump would be announcing a new nominee for the U.N. ambassador position \"soon.\"\n\nBruen said having the U.N. position unfilled for this long puts the U.S. at a disadvantage. The U.S. is one of five permanent members of the international body's Security Council.\n\n\"Without an ambassador at the United Nations, especially at the Security Council, we are severely handicapped,\" he said. \"We now have a major gap, just as we are trying to address and advance major issues like North Korea, Iran, and Russians' extracurricular adventures.\"\n\nPrior to joining the State Department, Nauert, a 48-year-old native of Illinois, was a reporter for “Fox & Friends” and served in several other positions at the cable network channel. As a journalist, Nauert covered the 9/11 terror attacks, the war in Iraq and four presidential elections.\n\nSecretary of State Michael R. Pompeo said he respected Nauert's decision.\n\n“Heather Nauert has performed her duties as a senior member of my team with unequalled excellence,\" Pompeo said. \"I wish Heather nothing but the best in all of her future endeavors and know that she will continue to be a great representative of this nation in whatever role she finds herself.”\n\nMore:President Trump taps ex-Fox News anchor Heather Nauert for UN ambassador, strips post of Cabinet rank\n\nMore:Trump taps former Fox News reporter to lead agency countering Russian disinformation", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/11/trump-to-name-stephen-miller-as-deputy-chief-of-staff-for-policy/76199780007/", "title": "Trump to name Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is expected to name Stephen Miller, one of his top immigration advisers, to serve as White House deputy chief of staff for policy, according to several news reports.\n\nWhile Trump has yet to officially name Miller, sources familiar with the plans told CNN the announcement would be made in the next few days.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance and Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser in the 2024 Trump campaign, both congratulated Miller on his new role in posts on X.\n\n\"This is another fantastic pick by the president,\" Vance wrote in the post, early Monday morning.\n\nMore:Is 'more chaos' on tap at US-Mexico border as Donald Trump returns to White House?\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nWho is Stephen Miller?\n\nMiller served as senior advisor to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House.

It still holds the speed record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by a passenger liner, an honor earned on its maiden voyage in 1952, according to the SS United States Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that honors the ship's heritage.\n\nThe plan for the historic ship is for it to be towed by tugboats to Mobile, Alabama where it will be broken down to serve as an artificial reef. After that 12-month process – where hazardous materials, fuel and other parts that could harm the environment will be removed – it will be towed to the Florida panhandle where it will rest off the state's coast near Destin-Fort Walton Beach.\n\nBut the ship's Nov. 15 departure from the Philadelphia port where it has been docked for 28 years has been delayed \"because of a tropical disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico that could impede safe delivery of the vessel to its destination in Mobile, Alabama,\" Okaloosa County, Florida officials said in a press release.\n\nDig deeper:How SS United States, bigger than Titanic, will become world's largest artificial reef\n\nThe operation has been delayed \"to ensure logistical details and procedures maintain ideal conditions for the move,\" Okaloosa County spokesman Nick Tomecek said, Delaware Online reported, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nA new date has not been set.\n\nHuman head washes ashore:Found on Florida beach, police investigating: reports\n\nThe SS United States: What to know\n\nDeveloped by shipping operator United States Lines and the U.S. government, the SS United States was part luxury liner – celebrity passengers included Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe, Bob Hope and John Wayne – and part secret weapon, the conservancy website says. Built with the help of the Pentagon, the ship could also quickly be converted into a troop carrier.\n\nThe SS United States is currently docked on Philadelphia’s Delaware River. The ship has been there since 1996 and can no longer move under her own steam.\n\nWhy will the SS United States become a reef?\n\nOkaloosa County, Florida, which includes the cities of Destin and Fort Walton Beach, got the rights to the ocean liner last month to add it to its artificial reef program.\n\n“Once deployed off Destin-Fort Walton Beach, at nearly 1,000-feet long, the SS United States will be a home for a diverse range of marine life and attract divers and anglers from around the world,” Okaloosa County said in press release, reported the Pensacola News Journal, which is part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nThe exact location in the Gulf of Mexico for the vessel’s final resting place has not been set, but it is expected to be about 20 miles south of the Destin-Fort Walton Beach coast, officials said.\n\nWhile there are benefits to artificial reefs – snorkeling and fishing among them – some sites have led to illegal dumping, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And if what's sunken to make the artificial reef isn't properly broken down, toxic chemicals can leach out, some conservation groups say.\n\nContributing: Mollye Barrows, Juan Carlos Castillo, Matthew Korfhage, and Shannon Marvel McNaught\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Since 1978, numerous attempts to return the ship to profitability have been unsuccessful.\n\nAnd yet the liner still captivates the public, says Susan Gibbs, president of the SS United States Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that bought the ship in 2011 and sought to have it restored.\n\n\"She remains hugely fascinating to people from all over the world,\" Gibbs says.\n\nEven today, visitors come to Philadelphia to see it and artists set up easels and paint, she says. \"Children send us crayon drawings of the ship.\"\n\nThe liner's departure, originally scheduled for Friday, has been delayed by weather and checks on planning and procedures, Okaloosa County, Florida, officials announced Nov. 12. A new date has not been set.\n\nWhere is the SS United States moving to?\n\nCan't see our graphics? Click here.\n\nWhen departure day comes, four tractor tugs and one lead tug will maneuver the 990-foot liner – 108 feet longer than Titanic – from South Philadelphia down the Delaware River to the coast, Okaloosa County officials told USA TODAY.\n\nIt'll take about two weeks for a tugboat to tow the SS United States from Philadelphia to Mobile, Alabama. The ship's engines are not operable. The tug will guide the liner close to the coast, to avoid ocean currents.\n\nThe tugs will deliver the ship to the docks of Modern American Recycling Services – MARS – a company that specializes in vessel salvage and other marine operations. The vessel will spend a year there in preparation for its sinking in the Gulf Coast waters off Okaloosa County.\n\nWorkers will remove contaminants and non-metal objects from the ship, according to marineinsight.com. The vessel's two funnels, radar mast and other structures will be removed, with some destined to become part of a museum dedicated to the ship.\n\nWhere will the SS United States be sunk as a reef?\n\nOkaloosa County officials are still deciding on where the ship will be sunk. It’s expected to be about 20 miles south of the Florida Panhandle region in the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area, the Pensacola News Journal reported.\n\nHoles will be cut into the ship's hull to create holes to flood the vessel. Water will be pumped into the ship until it falls below the water line, letting water into the holes. It could take five hours or more for the liner to sink.\n\nThe ship will settle upright on the seafloor. Once submerged, it will become a silent habitat for marine life and provide extra protection against shoreline erosion.\n\nOkaloosa County has prioritized buying and sinking ships using tourist development tax dollars in recent years, which has made the Destin area a diving destination, the News Journal said.\n\nThe county agreed in October to buy the SS United States for $1 million, part of a $10.1 million budget appropriation that will turn the vessel into an artificial reef, the Northwest Florida Daily News reported.\n\nThe liner will join a group of other vessels that have become artificial reefs in the Gulf region, including the USS Oriskany, a 888-foot-long U.S. Navy aircraft carrier that was sunk 22.5 nautical miles off the Pensacola Pass in May 2006. The carrier has become a popular but challenging dive for scuba divers.\n\nNew museum will help preserve ship's memory\n\nThe SS United States is a marvel of engineering, the longest and largest ocean liner ever built in America and holder of a transatlantic naval speed record that remains unbroken to this day, USA TODAY reported.\n\nOkaloosa County will work with the SS United States Conservancy to build a companion museum and visitor center dedicated to the SS United States and its history. The museum will include \"hopefully, both of her funnels, the radar mast, and other components,\" Gibbs says.\n\nA location has not been set, but the museum will be built in the Destin-Fort Walton Beach area, United Press International reported.\n\nWhile it's still in the planning stage, the museum will be paired with the reef and is planned \"as an exciting space that will tell the story of the ship and its moments in American history,\" says Gibbs, who is the granddaughter of William Francis Gibbs, the designer of the SS United States.\n\nIt will display artifacts and documents the Conservancy has collected over the years and will incorporate the latest technology, including virtual reality, she says.\n\n\"We've begun brainstorming about an enhanced experience for visitors,\" Gibbs says. \"Where would we want to zoom people back to? Would it be the ship's maiden voyage and have you huddling up on the bridge as the wind is racing by?\"\n\nThe new reef and museum will attract thousands of eager visitors, including scuba divers and fishermen, all bringing tourist dollars to the local economy.\n\nHow does the SS United States compare with the RMS Titanic?\n\nA comparison between the two ocean liners is inevitable. For the record, the maiden voyage of the SS United States was in 1952, 40 years after the Titanic sank.\n\nBuilt in the U.S., the SS United States was believed to be \"the safest passenger ship ever built, in contrast to the 'unsinkable' Titanic,\" according to the Conservancy. It was built with fireproof materials.\n\nIts 24 lifeboats and additional rafts could hold 4,060 people, \"over 1,000 more than the ship itself could hold booked at 100 percent capacity,\" the Conservancy says.\n\nWhy couldn't the SS United States be saved?\n\nDespite its remarkable history, the SS United States could not be saved. The costs proved too high.\n\nIt was built after World War II, when hunger increased for international travel, and when ocean-going ships were viewed as necessary for rapid overseas movement of soldiers.\n\nConstruction began in 1950 and the U.S. government paid for part of the cost, with the understanding it could be used as a troopship, if needed. It had the ability to transport 14,000 troops 10,000 miles without refueling, according to gcaptain.com. It never had to.\n\nThe ship's maiden voyage began July 3, 1952, and the liner broke the trans-Atlantic speed record in both directions. During the next 17 years it made 400 two-way voyages, Gibbs says.\n\nBut as trans-ocean airline flights became more popular, few travelers booked passage and the ship's owner, United States Lines, lost money. The SS United States was taken out of service in November 1969.\n\nThe liner was sold to a succession of owners from 1978 to 2009. It's been docked on the Delaware River in Philadelphia since 1996.\n\nIt was purchased in 2011 by the SS United States Conservancy, which sought to save the ship by redeveloping it into a floating hotel or other East Coast tourist attraction. Financial backing fell through, and the liner was sold to Okaloosa County in 2024.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nYou can track the progress of the SS United States on its voyage to Mobile, Alabama, with this online map from Oklaloosa County.

The process is expected to take a couple of days and will force several bridges in the area to temporarily close for the move.\n\nOnce the SS US is escorted into the Atlantic Ocean, the county said, some of the tugboats will pull away and the rest of the ship’s voyage will require two to three tugs to tow the vessel until it reaches Mobile.

As part of the $10.1 million deal to purchase and prepare to sink the ship as an artificial reef Okaloosa County is partnering with the SS United States Conservancy to develop a land-based museum and visitor center in Destin-Fort Walton Beach “that will celebrate and commemorate our nation’s flagship.”\n\nOkaloosa will also provide the Conservancy with updates on the ship and support the Conservancy’s museum plans to preserve the SS United States’ storied history by incorporating iconic features from the ship, including the funnels, radar mast, and other signature components, as well as the Conservancy’s extensive curatorial and archival collection.\n\nOkaloosa County signed an agreement to purchase the ship in August after Escambia County's Tourist Development Council (TDC) delayed discussions about purchasing the grand ocean liner. Escambia County had originally pursued a possible to deal to buy the ship and sink it in the Gulf of Mexico off county waters as an artificial reef, but Escambia County leaders were not as adamant in obtaining the SS United States as Okaloosa County’s leaders.\n\nOkaloosa County has made purchasing and sinking ships with tourist development tax dollars a priority in recent years, which has made the Destin area a diving destination. It’s an effort some in Escambia County – including local divers, charter boat captains, and other county and tourism leaders – would like to emulate, saying it would put Escambia back on the map with divers and bring in more money and business.\n\nEscambia County’s Marine Advisory Committee and Natural Resources Department are working to identify other ships to in the area and sink continue building up the local artificial reef program, as well.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/12/historic-ss-united-states-ship-lawsuit-ejection-philadelphia-pier-delaware-river/70163909007/", "title": "SS United States, larger than Titanic, sued for eviction in Philly", "text": "The historic SS United States is the largest passenger ship built in America, still holder of the transatlantic speed record\n\nMoored in Philly since 1996, its landlords have filed suit to evict the ship\n\nThe SS United states Conservancy is fighting the suit, and has big plans to turn the ship into a floating hotel and museum\n\nEven a 53,000-ton symbol of American excellence is not immune to a housing crisis.\n\nThe SS United States, known variously as “America’s flagship” and “speed queen of the seas,” could be forced from its Delaware River berth in Philadelphia by an eviction lawsuit perhaps unique in the country.\n\nThough now immobile, the nearly thousand-foot-long ship remains the largest and fastest transatlantic passenger liner ever built in America. An icon of the golden days of oceanic luxury, it was also a marvel of engineering that hosted four U.S. presidents and celebrities from Marilyn Monroe to Walt Disney.\n\nFor the 27 years since the ship has been moored at Pier 82 on the Delaware River, the SS United States’ funnels have presided 175 feet high over the low-slung skyline of South Philly, an unlikely source of wonderment to shoppers in the parking lot of a nearby Ikea.\n\nBut during the pandemic in 2021, the vessel’s landlords hiked the rent by double. Now, according to federal legal filings, pier operators would like the ship gone. The suit for ejection was filed a few months before the Port of Philadelphia announced bold renovation plans.\n\nLawyers for operators Penn Warehousing & Distribution say in legal documents that the historic ship’s owners are scofflaws who’ve refused to pay the new rent — and caused damage to the pier. Penn's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe nonprofit SS United States Conservancy, the ship’s owners, denies these claims. They argue in court filings that they’re model tenants who’d dutifully paid the same $850 a day they'd agreed upon more than a decade ago — and that their lease with Penn Warehousing had no provisions for sudden and unilateral rent hikes.\n\nEither way, the ship’s future is now in question.\n\nThe SS United States is a monument to American exceptionalism\n\nThe SS United States is a vital piece of our history, said Conservancy president Susan Gibbs — one that must be preserved as a testament to American unity and ingenuity.\n\n“There is no other American ocean liner left,” Gibbs said, while standing atop the ship’s highest deck in May. “She was the greatest ship in her day, and she remains so now. And it's just so important to preserve our history as a nation.”\n\nMore photos:Peek inside the SS United States, the last of the great ocean liners\n\nBack in 2015:SS United States, once fastest liner afloat, faces scrapper's torch\n\nThe SS United States is the biggest passenger ship built entirely in this country. The two-way transatlantic speed record it set on its 1952 maiden voyage remains unrivaled by any ship anywhere.\n\n“The ship smashed the transatlantic speed record using only two-thirds of her power,” Gibbs crowed. The ship has still never been brought to its theoretical full speed of 42 knots.\n\nThe SS United States ferried immigrants to new homes in America after the World War and was fully racially integrated starting from its first voyage. The ship also played host to royalty, not just England's Duke of Windsor but also Duke Ellington of the United States. The future Jackie Kennedy plied her early journalism career aboard its decks, capturing the shipboard habits of aristocratic dogs. In sumptuous dining rooms, chef Otto Bismarck served specialties from poularde de Bresse to kangaroo tail soup.\n\nIf laid on its side, the 990-foot ship would be taller than any building in New Jersey or Delaware, and would also be the second tallest in Philadelphia — bested only by a recent Comcast tower that looks a little like a cigarette being pulled out of its pack.\n\nDespite its literally Titanic size, the SS United States could outrun a torpedo in its day, said the ship’s caretaker, Ray Griffiths, a feat that made the ship as attractive to diplomats as it was to stars like Gary Cooper or Liz Taylor.\n\nIndeed, aspects of the ship’s design remained state secrets during its early years. Its designer, William Francis Gibbs, was a legendary designer of Navy ships. The United States was built as a military-private partnership, which allowed it to transform into a military asset transporting 14,000 troops if the Cold War ever went hot.\n\n“She's overbuilt. She's built like a Navy ship would have been from that era,” Griffiths said. “Mr. Gibbs combined almost all of his favorite types of designs and put it in the ship. He tried to iron out every potential weakness that he could come up with. And he did a terrific job. Everybody knows about the Titanic, right? It sank. That's why it's so famous. This ship did not.”\n\nThe lawsuit that threatens the SS United States' berth in Philadelphia\n\nThe unsinkable SS United States’ current troubles began on Aug. 10, 2021, when a controller at Penn Warehousing sent a terse letter to the Conservancy, saying the ship had been in place for too long without a rent increase.\n\nHenceforth, as of two weeks from that moment, the rent would double to $1,700 a day, said the letter, double the rate previously outlined in the lease.\n\nThe Conservancy instead continued to pay the previously agreed-upon rate of $850 a day, pending negotiations. According to the lease document presented to the court, their rent was due at that rate “until the vessel is removed from its current location.”\n\nIn March of the next year, Penn Warehousing filed a removal notice and then a lawsuit, citing back rent of more than $160,000. They asked the courts to eject the ship from Pier 82.\n\nThe Conservancy’s lawyers countered that the port operator had no provisions in the lease that allowed them to unilaterally raise rent — certainly not with two weeks' notice during a pandemic — and that Penn Warehousing had taken this action to force the long-mothballed ship into financial duress, and out of the port.\n\nThe facts of the rent dispute are not substantively in question: Lawyers for each side attached largely the same documents as evidence.\n\nAfter the case for ejection in Pennsylvania was tossed on technical grounds, Penn Warehousing took it to federal court, where it now sits after multiple mitigation attempts failed. The trial is scheduled to go in front of a jury as soon as Sept. 18 of this year.\n\nA troubled 50-year-history for the SS United States\n\nThis lawsuit is hardly the first existential threat faced by the SS United States in the last half-century.\n\nAmerica’s onetime flagship was put out of service in 1969, victim mostly to the rise of commercial airplanes. It now floats forlornly behind a security checkpoint in a working pier off South Philly’s Columbus Boulevard, a stately and unlikely presence looming over the drive-thru lines of a nearby Chick-fil-A.\n\nThe vessel passed like a cursed monkey’s paw from owner to owner in the decades since it went out of service. Each new possessor had visionary plans for the famed vessel. It would be, perhaps, a time-share cruise ship. A Hawaiian passenger liner. A floating hotel. A casino, an offshore entertainment complex or a hospital ship.\n\nEach plan was scuttled. Time and again, the SS United States barely escaped the scrapyard.\n\nIn 1984, a debt-riddled Seattle developer stripped the ship hollow and auctioned “everything that was freestanding or could be unbolted from her interiors,” according to an article that year in the New York Times.\n\nPeeling primer now hangs like stalactites from much of its interior. Rust mottles its outer hull, whose lower half shimmers with rainbow reflections when the light hits it just so. The ship’s famous red, white and blue funnels stand denuded.\n\nThe ship’s magisterial grand ballroom, its original dancefloor still intact, stands empty except for a bar constructed for a Colin Farrell action movie, \"Dead Man Down,\" shot there in 2012.\n\nAll that remains of the ship’s first-class cabins are skeletal outlines on the floor. The vessel’s second-class bar is now in use only for fundraisers — a few beer bottles leftover from one such event stood scattered across a bartop on our May visit — or maybe the occasional shift drink by the skeleton crew who still keeps the United States in shape.\n\nBut whatever the ship’s cosmetic condition, said caretaker Griffiths, its “bones” are still good. The metal remains largely uncorroded. Even after being stripped, the ship is watertight after some careful maintenance.\n\nGriffiths pats the ship with evident pride.\n\nFormer passenger Andrew Staroscik remembers playing pingpong there, as a 7-year-old Polish child whose family escaped the German invasion in World War II. His first awestruck vision of America was of the men who hosed down the ship in New York Harbor.\n\n\"I remember arriving in New York City and the fire hoses shooting water,\" said Staroscik, now retired from a career at Bell Labs. \"It was like you see in movies.\"\n\nThis May, he was thrilled to find that pingpong table still there, though covered in dust and missing its net, along cavernous sun-filled walkways where he remembers sprinting back and forth en route to his new country.\n\n\"Shame it's in such a state,\" Staroscik said, gesturing to the ship that to him once seemed impossibly large.\n\nIn 1992, after auctioning the SS United States' fixtures, that Seattle developer eventually had to surrender the vessel to U.S. Marshals.\n\nThe SS United States was towed by new owners to Turkey, and then to Ukraine where she was stripped of asbestos — before finally being left out in South Philly to rust like some character in a Springsteen song.\n\nHow the ship was acquired by the nonprofit SS United States Conservancy for preservation\n\nSouth Philly is where Susan Gibbs first found her.\n\nHer grandfather William Francis Gibbs, a product of Harvard but a native of Philadelphia, had dreamed since his youth of designing the world’s fastest ship.\n\nHe pledged himself to the sea while still a boy, upon seeing the launch of a large ship in South Philly.\n\n“It was actually a lifelong obsession,” his granddaughter said. “He developed the first designs for a 1,000-foot-long, fast ocean liner back in 1914 or 1915. He dedicated his life to bringing this extraordinary ship into the world.”\n\nIn 1952 the SS United States became that masterpiece, the ship he’d dreamed of — a large passenger liner built with lightweight materials and designed to rigid military specifications, built to be both unburnable and unsinkable, with no wood on the ship that wasn't a kitchen butcher block or a piano.\n\n“She's America's flagship,” Susan Gibbs said. “And she just personified the nation's competence and technological know-how and ambition after World War II.”\n\nHer grandfather remained close to the ship, she said, calling the engineer and commodore each day while the ship was at sea, and greeting it in New York when it came back home.\n\nAfter she discovered a trove of old documents upon the death of her father in 1995, the SS United States became Susan Gibbs’s obsession as well.\n\nThe Conservancy she heads is a consortium of “maritime enthusiasts and historic preservationists” with donors from all 50 states and 40 countries, Gibbs said. A precursor group, in 1999, got the ship placed in the National Register of Historic Places, one of the youngest landmarks in the registry.\n\nThe Conservancy also made a believer out of billionaire Philadelphia philanthropist H.F. “Gerry” Lenfest, who ponied up $5.8 million in 2011 to help the nonprofit procure and preserve the historic vessel.\n\nThe SS United States' current stewards, like its past ones, have bold plans for the ship.\n\nIn 2018, they engaged developer RXR Realty and a host of naval designers, with plans to turn the ship’s more than 500,000 usable square feet into a floating hotel complex. Potential final destinations have included sites in Philadelphia, New York and Boston.\n\n“The vision is a hotel, an event space — with really amazing food and beverage opportunities, as the developers like to call it,” Gibbs said. “Like a 'Mad Men'-style lounge. As well as, of course, a Museum and Innovation Center.”\n\nThough delayed by the pandemic, these ambitious development plans are now again making “significant progress,” Gibbs said.\n\nWhat they need is a little more time.\n\nDevelopment plans for SS United States moving forward, amid obstacles\n\nTime is expensive for a ship like the SS United States. And it is not limitless. With each day, the amount Penn Warehousing says the ship owes grows larger.\n\nAnd the lawsuit might not be the only concern.\n\nIn July 2022, four months after Penn Warehousing's suit to eject the ship, the Port of Philadelphia unveiled a three-minute video outlining a bold new vision for the future, meant to revitalize the marine terminal on the Delaware River.\n\nAt Pier 82, where the SS United States sits, the agency’s video showed a bustling “Forest Products Center.”\n\nA computer depiction of the SS United States, moored to its pier, disappeared in the agency’s vision of the future. As triumphant music played, the ship was boarded over by a broad and blank dock, upon which moved a fleet of lumber trucks that seemed made from Legos.\n\nWhatever the results of the lawsuit, Gibbs knows the historic ocean liner has no permanent future at a South Philly pier walled off by security gates and closed to visitors.\n\nIts current berth at Pier 82 was always meant to be temporary, Gibbs said.\n\nThe question is whether they can find a new home in time — and whether they’ll get the chance to do so on their own timetable.\n\nThe SS United States may be the fastest transatlantic ship ever built. But it is now unable to move under its own steam. Indeed, three of its large propellers are displayed at museums around the country.\n\nMoving the ship even temporarily from its current berth would be not just time-consuming, but extremely costly. In 2015, facing insufficient funds, the Conservancy warned it might be forced to scrap the ship they’d charged themselves with preserving. That time, the donations came through.\n\n“From the beginning, we have seen three possible paths for the vessel,\" Gibbs said, standing outside the ship she treasures, “redevelopment as a stationary attraction, converting the ship into an artificial underwater reef or scrapping the vessel.”\n\nShe's confident there’s a path forward that doesn’t involve the grimmer two options, she said.\n\nGibbs points to the RMS Queen Mary, a British ocean liner with an equally troubled financial past, which just reopened to the public as a hotel and museum in California this spring. To the Queen Elizabeth 2, now a floating hotel in Dubai.\n\nThe SS United States can be “even better,” Gibbs said. With fixtures stripped, the ship has more possibilities for innovative design.\n\nRepresentatives from RXR Realty declined to comment on the current state of development plans. But Gibbs believes the Conservancy can still save a ship she sometimes wishes she didn’t fall in love with so deeply — a vessel she sees not just as the work of her grandfather, but as a vision of America at its best.\n\nA ship whose parts were built by people in all of the lower 48 states. An America not divided against itself. A country that worked together to accomplish something great.\n\nShe paused, suddenly, noting the reflections bouncing off the waves of the Delaware River and onto the sides of the ship: countless points of rainbowed light, dancing across the hull of the SS United States to music it seemed almost possible to hear.\n\n“Look at it shimmer,” she said, smiling. “Isn’t it beautiful?”\n\nMatthew Korfhage is a Philadelphia-based reporter for USA TODAY Network.

It took decades of research and development, stops and starts, power brokering, political compromise and lots of patience, but the painfully shy and late-blooming Philadelphia genius never gave up. He stuck to his vision and wowed all the right people in the private and public sector to attain his dream.\n\nThus, metaphorically, the story of Gibbs and the construction of the S.S. United States (completed in 1952) is really a snapshot of the American Dream culminating with this country's mid-century greatness. It may be a far cry from the uncertain America of today, but nostalgia aside, there's a great lesson to be learned about taking advantage of every opportunity despite economic challenges and individual setbacks. Gibbs was nothing if not persistent: He knew he had a hot property, and so did all the industrialists and politicians and military leaders and designers he approached and collaborated with.\n\nGibbs stood in awe of European ocean liner supremacy at the start of the 20th century, yet he figured out a way of transforming the American industry between the Titanic disaster of 1912 and the end of World War I. Gibbs wanted to combine speed, luxury and safety all in a superliner, and he came up with his own design. But his family fortune slipped away, and he was forced to leave Harvard and go into law. He was miserable.\n\nBut Gibbs obtained early support from J.P. Morgan Jr. and the Army during World War I, when troop and cargo transport was essential (future president Dwight Eisenhower was a young captain who came into contact with Gibbs). Then after the Great War, he needed government support in reconstructing the great German war prize, the Leviathan, into an American-flagged superliner. That turned into a political as well as a technological struggle. But Gibbs persevered by forming his own firm with younger brother, Frederic.\n\nEventually, Gibbs gained more confidence as his managerial skills matured and his ventures succeeded. He was no longer averse to conflict and even cultivated a talent for being disagreeable. As Steven Ujifusa recounts, Gibbs \"had a gift for wooing powerful supporters\" and maintaining \"autocratic control over every aspect of a project.\" And although it took 40 years to realize his dream, Gibbs managed to build ships of his design and \"willed into existence\" the finest ocean liner ever conjured.\n\nThe S.S. United States broke the transatlantic speed record held by the Queen Mary on her maiden voyage (July 4, 1952), crossing from New York Harbor to Cornwall in the U.K. in three days at an average speed of 40.96 mph. The ship was retired in 1969 and has changed ownership several times from 1978 to 1996, when it was docked in Philadelphia.\n\nAlthough there have been plans to return the ship to active service, the current owner, the SS United States Conservancy, has begun work this year on a restoration project for a proposed rebuild in Philadelphia. A new \"Save the United States\" online campaign has been launched, with the hope of raising funds and finding a developer to reinstate the ship in a selected city by the summer of next year.\n\n--\n\nBill Desowitz is the author of James Bond Unmasked.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/09/19/suffrage-movement-susan-b-anthony-portrait-monument-us-capitol-hillary-clinton/88317362/", "title": "No room for fourth bust on suffragette statue?", "text": "Denise Goolsby\n\nThe Desert Sun\n\nA 7-and-a-half ton, white marble statue is displayed prominently in the rotunda of the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., but unless you've taken a tour of this legislative hall or have studied the women's suffrage movement at length, there's a good chance you've never heard of the \"Portrait Monument,\" featuring the chiseled busts of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott.\n\nThe monument -- fashioned by sculptress Adelaide Johnson out of a massive slab of marble quarried in Carrara, Italy -- was unveiled at the Capitol rotunda on Feb. 15, 1921, on the 101st anniversary of Anthony's birth. Anthony, Stanton and Mott were among the leaders of the women's right to vote movement -- a decades-long fight that culminated in victory on Aug. 26, 1920, when the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was finally ratified by Congress.\n\nAside from the fact it's the only monument to women on display in the rotunda, there's something else that's unique about this work. It appears unfinished. Most notably, Johnson left a large piece of rough-hewn marble in the back of the statue. Her motive has been debated over the decades. Did she want her monument to represent the unfinished quest for women's equality? Was it representative of future, yet-to-be women's rights leaders, \"a kind of an unknown soldier of the woman's movement?\"\n\nI'd never heard about this piece until I took a tour of the U.S. Capitol in April 2010, when our guide walked over to the odd-shaped memorial and shared stories about its history.\n\nWhile the guide tossed out the possibility that the unfinished marble could be sculpted into the likeness of the first US woman president, that's a fact that has not been confirmed. A Senate bill in 2004 seeking to add the face of African-American civil rights activist Sojourner Truth died in Congress. An official with the office of the Architect of the Capitol told The Desert Sun no bust is planned for the unfinished marble because there's not enough room for one.\n\nRegardless, the history of this piece is fascinating and is truly symbolic of the unfinished business of the centuries-long push for women's equality.\n\nThe monument was presented to the U.S. Capitol as a gift \"from the women of the U.S.\" by the National Woman's Party - an American women's organization formed in 1916 with a singular focus: To secure an amendment to the U.S. Constitution ensuring a woman's right to vote. The presentation coincided with the NWP's national convention in Washington D.C. Once the 19th Amendment was ratified, the group tackled other equality-of-life-issues, including advocating for the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment, drafted by women's movement leader Alice Paul in 1923.\n\nThe historic presentation was captured in the pages of the Des Moines Register in its Feb. 21, 1921 edition:\n\n\"The women of America wrote the final chapter in the history of their struggle for the ballot tonight when the memorial statue of the three great suffrage pioneers – Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth C. Stanton and Lucretia Mott – was installed in the capitol rotunda.\n\nDelegates representing every state and more than fifty national women’s organizations, participated in the ceremonies.\n\nWith music, flowers and pageantry, the statue of the suffrage pioneers – the first memorial commemorating the work of women for women was presented to Congress tonight by American women and dedicated in the rotunda of the capitol.\n\nMiss Jane Addams of Chicago presided over the ceremonies.\"\n\nAddams was one of the most prominent activists/reformer of her era.\n\n“The placing of this memorial is a significant milestone on the long road to self-government,\" Addams said in the Des Moines Register story. \"It commemorates much more than a great achievement in the history of the United States although as such it deserves an honored place in the rotunda, because these pioneer suffragettes, whom we are meant to honor, all Americans as they were, were the first women in any country to form a definite organization for the sole purpose of securing for women ‘the sacred right of the elective franchise.’ They, therefore, became the pioneers of a great movement not only for their own countrywomen, but forward looking women of the world.”\n\nFor the ceremonies that night, the memorial was placed between the statues of Abraham Lincoln and Robert E. Lee, directly opposite the entrance to the rotunda and against a background of purple draperies.\n\n\"Suffragists and antisuffragists, teachers, mothers, artists, nurses and working women in a long processional carried wreaths which they placed at the base of the statue. Beside the representative of each organization walked flower girls and banner bearers robed in purple, white and gold.\"\n\nLeading the entire processional were descendants of the pioneers themselves.\n\nDelivering the presentation address, Sara Bard Field of San Francisco declared the memorial statue was presented to the nation not merely as the “busts of three women who have fought the good fight,” but as an offering of the “body and blood of a great sacrificial host,” who struggled with and after them to achieve the cause now won.\n\n“I do not feel that I arrogate to my faith in women too much,” Field said, “when I say that with the dedication of these busts of our pioneers there is presented tonight a renewed dedication of the women to the vast work of a greater freedom which lies before us.”\n\nTo the surprise of the many women gathered at the ceremony, Field remarked that “it made her heart glad” that the first gift of women to the nation’s gallery represents no military heroes, “but those who gave life, not took it, and through their likenesses we are dedicating the women’s protest against war.”\n\n“With the right to vote goes the right to representation in the “Hall of Fame,” say the suffragists.”\n\nFrederick Gillett, Speaker of the House of Representatives, accepted the memorial on behalf of Congress, which, ironically, was the first Congress ever elected by the women of the country as a whole.\n\nIn his address of acceptance, Gillett described the occasion as “symbolic of a change of tremendous significance – the admission of women in our electorate as equal partners in the great business of government.”\n\nThe Feb. 16, 1921 edition of The Washington (D.C.) Herald set the scene:\n\n\"Following the Speaker’s remarks of acceptance, lights were turned low and as strains of the “Recessional” lost themselves in the shadowed arches of the lofty dome, the drapery was removed from Mrs. Adelaide Johnson’s sculptured group. Suddenly, the statue was enveloped in a blaze of light, and the figures were revealed … between the marble figures of Washington and (Lee), Carrara white against the somber walls ... a soloist in the gallery sang softly and a chorus of fifty voices sang during the recessional of the women who had remained grouped around the statue.\"\n\nComing to the Capitol\n\nThe sculptress experienced great difficulty in securing Italian assistants to help carve the marble and workmen to move the sculpture to the SS Dante Alighieri, the Italian oceanliner - named after Dante, the Italian poet of the Middle Ages - that would deliver Johnson's monument to the U.S.\n\nOnce it was ready for shipment, it was almost an insurmountable challenge for Johnson to get the massive piece from Carrara to the port in Genoa. It was decided that shipping it by freight would be too slow.\n\nWhen the monument was crated - it stood about seven-and-a-half feet tall - \"the oxen were driven right into my studio and hauled it to the road,\" Johnson recounted at the time. \"The laborers went on strike when it was but half way to the vessel and the monument remained there for thirty hours. When the laborers again began moving it toward the sailing vessel, the sea was bad and it was decided to secure a freight train which was to run as far as Genoa. It was only when, after repeated delays, I was able to see the monument hoisted onto the liner in Genoa that I was able to breathe freely once more.\"\n\nAfter a transatlantic voyage, Johnson arrived in the U.S. with her suffrage memorial statue on Jan. 31, 1921.\n\nReports from that time said the statue would be placed in the Capitol Rotunda for the ceremony, then moved temporarily to the Capitol Crypt - the room below the rotunda, where it would remain on display. It's not actually a crypt - it was so-named because a tomb built below this room was to be the final resting place of President George Washington and his wife Martha. However, Washington's last will expressed his desire to be buried at his home in Mount Vernon in Virginia.\n\nBut the crypt - which features 40 Doric columns and statues of prominent individuals from the nation's original 13 colonies - was considered the basement of the Capitol at the time, and the massive marble tribute was pushed up against a wall where it collected dust until it was moved to a \"place of honor\" at the center of the crypt on Sept. 23, 1921.\n\nBut some hanky-panky had taken place between that time and Oct. 1, 1921, when Johnson returned to Washington, D.C. from her home in New York to see the new placement.\n\nShe was shocked to find that the inscription she placed at the back of the monument had been erased! It wasn't entirely unexpected, because the words she wrote caused a stir and sparked controversy prior to the dedication of her monument. Johnson, who had intended to chisel the inscription into the marble, was running out of time to complete her work, so it was stenciled onto the surface in gold lettering.\n\nBy the end of the second paragraph - after Johnson had described her three subjects in the context of history - she wrote about how the women, \"guided the only fundamental universal uprising on our planet: The Woman's Revolution.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Principle not policy; justice not favor; men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less, was the clarian call to the most astounding upheaval of all time ...\n\n\"Woman, first denied a soul, then called mindless, now arisen declared herself an entity to be reckoned.\n\n\"Spiritually, the woman movement ... represents the emancipation of womanhood. The release of the feminine principal in humanity, the moral integration of human evolution come to rescue torn and struggling humanity from its savage self.\"\n\nThere's more, but you get the point. It was too much for the men on the Hill. The Joint Committee on the Library - the group that oversaw the statuary of the Capitol, was adamant that the inscription be covered during the dedication, which it was. When it was later moved from against the wall and the inscription could be seen by the public, there was great haste in getting it removed for good.\n\nSeventy-six years after the statue was relegated to the \"basement,\" it took an act of Congress - House Concurrent Resolution 216 was passed in September 1996 - to get the monument moved back to the Capitol Rotunda, where it was relocated in May 1997.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe National Statuary Hall Collection in the U.S. Capitol is comprised of statues donated by individual states to honor persons notable in their history. The entire collection now consists of 100 statues contributed by 50 states, two from each. Thirty-five statues are displayed in National Statuary Hall while others have been placed in other parts of the Capitol including the Crypt, the Hall of Columns, and the Capitol Visitor Center.\n\nCalifornia statues:\n\nFather Junipero Serra (Miguel Jose Serra), Spanish missionary\n\nSculptor: Ettore Cadorin\n\nLocation: National Statuary Hall\n\nYear statue was added to collection: 1931\n\nRonald Wilson Reagan, U.S. President\n\nSculptor: Chas Fagan\n\nLocation: Capitol Rotunda\n\nYear statue was added to the collection: 2009", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/cruiselog/2015/03/04/cruise-ship-tours-princess-classics/23893499/", "title": "Inside the Princess ships that made cruising history", "text": "Gene Sloan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWhat were Princess Cruises' early ships like?

Loaded with furs in what's now Wisconsin, the Griffon was said to have sunk somewhere in northern Lake Michigan in 1679.\n\nA couple in Charlevoix think they've found it. Steve and Kathie Libert, of Charlevoix, said they've spent more than 40 years seeking the answer to one of North America’s most enduring mysteries — the final resting place of the legendary Griffon. Reports by French explorers and missionaries said Native Americans told them they saw the ship go down with all hands.\n\nThe Liberts say the wreck lies near tiny, uninhabited Poverty Island, part of a chain of islands that runs southwest into Lake Michigan from Michigan's Upper Peninsula. French archeologists who visited the site at the Liberts' invitation have said they believe the couple is on to something; they even staked a claim for France for whatever wreckage turns up, Steve and Kathie Libert say in their 2021 book, \"Le Griffon and the Huron Islands,\" published by Traverse City's Mission Point Press (about $26 in softcover and $35 in newly released hardcover).\n\nSteve is scheduled to talk about the couple's lifelong quest and sign books at 7 p.m. Thursday at the Rochester Hills Public Library. (The program is free to the public but advance registration is required; search under calendar.rhpl.org, move the cursor to May 12 and click on \"Solving the First Great Lakes Maritime Mystery.\")\n\nSkeptics abound\n\nProminent historians and shipwreck experts in Michigan doubt the Liberts' claim. Yet none has accompanied Steve on his dives, the couple said in an interview last week at their waterfront condominium in Charlevoix. The Liberts are well-known in northern Michigan for their decades-long campaign to find the Griffon, but this week's talk is Steve's first appearance in metro Detroit.\n\n\"I've been interested in this ship since I was 14,\" he said in an interview in Charlevoix last week.\n\n\"It started with a junior high teacher, talking about early European explorers. He mentioned this ship. As he walked the room, he said, 'Who knows? Maybe somebody will find that ship someday,' and he touched me on the shoulder.\"\n\nFrom then on, Steve's obsession grew. He met Kathie in high school when he returned on crutches after a football injury and teachers asked her to carry his books. After a long courtship and college degrees, they married in 1981.\n\n\"That's when I learned about his attachment to the Griffon, and really to the Great Lakes and all shipwrecks,\" she said. So she joined his quest, although she is unable to dive with him because she has had a perforated eardrum since childhood.\n\nMore:Travel the Great Lakes on a floating mansion with new Viking cruise ships\n\nMore:Report: Recycling in Michigan reaches 19.3%, up 35.4% in 3 years\n\n\"I've supported the historical part of it,\" including the accumulation and study of an entire wall of books about French exploration of North America, 17th-century shipbuilding techniques, and just about everything ever written — from 1769 on — about the Griffon. The ship's name is sometimes converted to an English spelling — \"The Griffin\" — but in French, it's Le Griffon.\n\nA lifelong dream\n\nThe Liberts have no children, so, in effect, the Griffon is their child. They pursued lifelong careers in Washington, D.C. — Steve in Naval intelligence, Kathie with her own marketing firm — but visited northern Michigan summer after summer. Now they're retired in Charlevoix, a four-hour boat ride from the dive site that they hope will someday disprove the naysayers.\n\nAt the couple’s condo, they showed the Free Press their underwater metal detectors, a wall of research books, and a sculpture of a Griffon — the French coat of arms symbol for which the ill-fated ship was named — as they made plans for Steve to dive again this summer.\n\nThey want what they’ve found preserved. They’ve vowed to take nothing at the dive site — that is, nothing but underwater photos and video. Their hope is to prove that this is the ship that went missing for 343 years.\n\nAsked about the couple's claims, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources was quick to dismiss them. In an email, a DNR spokesman said the wreckage the Liberts have targeted can't be the Griffon:\n\n\"Our archeologist’s review of recently published media images reveals the remains of a shipwreck that features typical late 19th-century Great Lakes shipbuilding materials and methodologies, and scantlings that are entirely too large to be a French colonial vessel. The keelson structure with mast steps, paired floors and futtocks, and ceiling timbers all suggest a sailing craft, probably a schooner or schooner-barge, that was built and operated during the last half of the 1800s. Additionally, this particular shipwreck is well-known, can be clearly seen on aerial imagery internet sites, and has been visited by state authorities.\"\n\nThe Liberts dispute that statement, pointing to their years of studying all they could find about the construction of 17th-century French ships, much of which they summarize and illustrate in their book.\n\nAnother skeptic is Corey Adkins, communications content director for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society. The nonprofit group operates the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in tiny Paradise, Michigan, near the shore of Lake Superior, as well as the oldest working lighthouse on the Great Lakes, Adkins said.\n\nThe group's search team has discovered several shipwrecks, including that of the 172-foot schooner-barge Atlanta, found just last year and deemed \"still beautiful after 130 years on the bottom of Lake Superior\" by society Executive Director Bruce Lynn. Its museum has extensive displays of numerous shipwreck artifacts and other lore of the lakes, scale models of every conceivable type of vessel that sank, and even the restored bell of the ill-fated Edmund Fitzgerald. As for the Griffon?\n\n\"We don't really have anything on the Griffon. There have been numerous quote-unquote discoveries of the Griffon that were never proven,\" Adkins said. The Society's website, viewed last week, had three paragraphs about the Griffon, including the sentence: \"In 2001, a famous Great Lakes shipwreck hunter, Steve Libert, claimed her wreck in northern Lake Michigan near Poverty Island.\" When a reporter mentioned that, Adkins said, \"I think we'll be removing that today.\"\n\n[ Want more news like this? Download our app for the latest ]\n\nWhether the Liberts found the Griffon or merely stumbled on the watery wreckage of some unidentified old ship, their book and the saga of their search open a door to the fascinating earliest days of European exploration in the Great Lakes, before the founding of Detroit in 1701. At the Rochester Hills Public Library, which also serves the neighboring city of Rochester and Oakland Township, Community Relations Manager Tiffany Stozicki said she hoped that Steve Libert's talk will pique interest not only in shipwrecks but in the broader subjects of what this region was like, and who lived here, a century and a half before Michigan became a state.\n\nStozicki said she contacted the Liberts after a patron left her a program from the Charlevoix Public Library, where Steve Libert spoke in November.\n\n\"I'm an independent historian, and I thought our patrons would be interested,\" said Stozicki, who is president of the Rochester-Avon Historical Society.\n\n\"Especially going back that far, it's really hard to prove things. But we just wanted to let our community consider this mystery. People are fascinated by shipwrecks and the Great Lakes,\" Stozicki said.\n\nFor students of history, of any age, the Liberts' book is a good example of using primary source documents — old maps and woodcuts from centuries-old books; records left by Jesuit missionaries, who traveled through the area of the Griffon's last sightings in 1670-1672; and the diaries of expedition leader Robert Cavelier de la Salle and of the exploring party's missionary priest, Father Louis Hennepin.\n\nExploring with La Salle\n\nAs the book states, \"In 1678, La Salle led the first party of Europeans to Niagara Falls\"; and that Hennepin \"was the first to publicize the grandeur of the falls in his 1679 manuscript, 'A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America.' In 1679, La Salle ordered his ship built in the wilderness above the great falls, launching Le Griffon five months later in early May. This ship was the first decked vessel to sail the upper Great Lakes of a scale and design in keeping with 17th Century shipbuilding.\"\n\nLa Salle named the ship Le Griffon, after the mythical creature whose body of a lion has the head and wings of an eagle. The name honored Count Frontenac, the governor of all French territories in North America, whose coat of arms featured the symbol. After La Salle's exploits in the Great Lakes, he led his followers down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico, claiming all he'd seen for France. Years later, he was shipwrecked off the coast of Texas and killed in 1687 by mutinous soldiers, according to historians cited by the Liberts.\n\n\"Kids should know, this is the guy who claimed all the land that became the Louisiana Purchase. That's a lot of our country,\" Steve Libert said.\n\nThe Liberts' book also uses interpretative history — color photos shot above water and below; Kathie's line drawings that depict the Griffon buffeted by the storm that sank it, as well as showing details of its likely hull design, and numerous contemporary maps of northern Lake Michigan.\n\nThe Griffon had seven cannons, according to old French records, Kathie said.\n\n\"They weren't locked down. They just sat there (on gun carriages). We're just hoping and praying, if we could find one of those in the sand somewhere, that would prove everything,\" she said.\n\nProof or not, it's certain that a storied chunk of the Great Lakes' mystery, romance and tragedy lies, somewhere, in the watery grave of Le Griffon.\n\nContact Bill Laitner: blaitner@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/az-narratives/2014/12/04/uss-arizona-pearl-harbor-survivors/19892203/", "title": "USS Arizona: The men who survived", "text": "Shaun McKinnon\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nGRASS VALLEY, Calif.\n\nLou Conter is telling the story of the night his patrol bomber was shot down seven miles off the coast of New Guinea, dumping the seaplane's 10-man crew into the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crew was not alone in the water.\n\n\"We had 10 or 12 sharks around us all the time,\" Conter says. \"I told the men, 'If a shark comes close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.'\"\n\nThe men stayed afloat until another plane saw the burning wreckage and tossed out a life raft. The exhausted crew dragged ashore an hour later and hid in the jungle, fearful they would be captured by Japanese soldiers. The next night, an American PT boat retrieved all 10 men.\n\nAs Conter told it, the story wasn't about punching sharks, or skulking in the jungle or chasing shadows to the waiting rescue boat. Conter was talking about survival, about coming back alive.\n\nHis time in the war started that way.\n\nHe was 20 when he escaped the burning wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor. He tried to save as many injured crewmen as he could, but when the sun set on Dec. 7, 1941, he was one of just 335 sailors who did not perish.\n\nConter fought on through World War II, scraped past a lot of close calls, then went to Korea. After that, he started teaching U.S. troops the skills of survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He wrote a training manual whose precepts the Navy still follows. Today, he tries to pass on what he knows to students of history.\n\nAt 93, he is one of the last survivors of the attack on the Arizona. He endured what he did, he says, because that was his job. And that's what he told every soldier and airman who took his courses.\n\nWhatever happens, find a way to survive.\n\nConter was stationed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in September 1941, when he turned 20. He and a buddy had been talking about their future in the Navy.\n\n\"Lou, let's go to flight school,\" Conter's buddy said one day.\n\n\"We won't get in,\" Conter said. \"We're right-arm rates.\" At the time, sailors wore patches designating their rates, the enlisted expression of rank, on the right or left sleeve, depending on their assignment. Aviators most often arose from left-arm rates.\n\nConter had made friends with a young lady in Honolulu. Her father was an engineer and a top executive for a dredging company with a big Navy contract. Conter was at the young lady's house one day when her father received an important visitor: Admiral William Calhoun, the commander of base force for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nCalhoun quizzed Conter about his posting, his job on the ship. Conter told the admiral he was interested in flight school, but doubted he would earn admission.\n\nCalhoun told Conter to put in for the assignment. A few weeks later, Conter and his buddy passed a flight test at sea and on Nov. 1, they got their orders: Report to Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Arizona's captain called the two sailors in and told them the ship was headed back to Long Beach in early December. They could ride to the mainland then and leave for Florida.\n\nTheir orders were lost on the Arizona when the battleship sank on Dec. 7. Conter and his buddy waited for new instructions, but heard nothing.\n\nIn early January, Conter visited his young lady friend again and again, Admiral Calhoun was there.\n\n\"I thought you'd be in flight school,\" he said.\n\nConter told him about the lost orders. Three days later, he and his buddy were on a ship to San Francisco and then a train to Pensacola.\n\nConter got his wings in November 1942. He was soon flying one of the Navy's Black Cats, a squadron of long-range patrol bombers painted black for night missions.\n\nThe Black Cats flew surveillance, search and rescue, sea patrol, but they proved especially valuable for nighttime assaults and nuisance raids on Japanese submarines and ships. The planes could fly at low altitudes, then buzz upward for a bombing run, confounding enemy gunners trying to calculate speed and distance.\n\nThe crews were based on tender ships moored in secluded harbors. Conter served on the San Pablo and Half Moon. The planes took off and landed on the water; the pilots tied up to buoys near the ship.\n\n\"We'd leave at 5:30 in the evening and stay out 12 or 14 hours, then return in the morning,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes, we'd come back, eat, then sleep on the beach.\"\n\nConter's crews flew missions across the South Pacific: New Guinea, Borneo, New Britain, the coast off Perth, Australia.\n\nThe crews learned the routines of the Japanese ships. The best time for a bombing raid was after 1 a.m., when the ship was quiet.\n\n\"We wouldn't get much fire back and by the time they sounded general quarters, we were on our way,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes they'd get shooting at you and you'd look at the shells and they looked like they were going to hit you. Then they'd go by.\"\n\nConter's plane hadn't been out long in September 1943 when enemy bullets pierced one of their rear hatches and hit a parachute flare. The flare exploded and started a fire, which forced the plane into the water.\n\n\"Say your prayers, men, we're seven miles off shore and we're in 10, 15-foot swells,\" one of the officers said as the crew abandoned the plane. \"I don't think we'll ever be able to swim to shore.\"\n\n\"Baloney,\" Conter replied. \"Knock it off. Just stay together, hold hands and kick slowly 'cause there'll be sharks around. If a shark comes too close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.\"\n\nThe men helped one another, holding up anyone who weakened. Not long after, a second plane dropped a life raft and all 10 of the crew made to shore and, the next night, back to the base.\n\nIn late 1943, Conter flew a mission to rescue more than 200 coast watchers in New Guinea. Coast watchers were military intelligence operatives who gathered information about enemy activities on islands across the South Pacific.\n\nThe planes flew up the Sepik River from the northern coast of New Guinea. The river wound through dense vegetation, leaving 15 or 20 feet of clearance on each side of the plane. If a plane crashed, crocodiles awaited in the river.\n\n\"In three days, we rescued 219 coast watchers without losing anybody,\" Conter said. \"The Japanese were only a mile away. It was one of the biggest rescues in World War II, but no one knew about it because everything was top secret in those days.\"\n\nIn Korea, Conter flew 29 missions, but his work in Naval intelligence left him vulnerable if the North Koreans captured him, so he was shipped to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in February 1954, the rank he held until he retired. His work turned toward survival training in a new military program called SERE, for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.\n\nConter helped establish training bases in Florida and California and in 1965, he returned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for troops headed to Vietnam.\n\nHe had stopped at Pearl Harbor more than a decade earlier, on his way to a posting in Korea. A platform marked the wreckage of the USS Arizona. Conter and others in his group boarded a boat to go out to the platform and see his old ship.\n\n\"We got halfway there and I told them to turn around,\" Conter said. \"I wasn't going out there. I couldn't.\"\n\nIn 1967, Conter retired from the Navy. More than 20 years earlier, he had earned his real estate license in California and had maintained it. He settled in Palm Springs and built a career as a real estate developer, buying up land for commercial and residential projects.\n\nThat same year, he met his wife, Valerie, in Palm Springs. Her sister knew Jack Warner, the film studio mogul, and invited Valerie to a movie premiere party Warner was hosting in Palm Springs for his latest project, \"Camelot\".\n\nConter attended the same event and was seated next to Valerie. They struck up a conversation and, after a brief courtship, married.\n\nToday, Lou and Valerie Conter live in a two-level house at the end of a winding road on a golf course in Grass Valley, a mountain town about 60 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nTall pines tower over the house. Deer and rabbits wander the hillside. Golfers play through 50 yards from Conter's driveway.\n\n\"I'm going to be back out there one of these days,\" Conter said, his voice wistful as he watches a foursome trying to stay on the greens. Conter's doctor has sidelined him for now for health reasons, but he is certain he will return soon.\n\nHe took up golf seriously in Palm Springs and played in the Bob Hope Classic six times, once on a team with crooner Johnny Mathis. He keeps a photo from that tournament on a bookshelf in an alcove off the kitchen.\n\nOn the same bookshelf sit mementos from his time on the Arizona. Medals. Photographs. A painting of the Arizona hangs on the wall of a sitting room. He keeps a folder of newspaper clippings, magazine stories and copies of a telegram.\n\n\"Here's the one that told my mother I was missing in action on the Arizona,\" he says. It is dated Dec. 21, 1941.\n\n\"The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Louis Anthony Counter quartermaster third class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThe telegram, which misspelled Conter's last name, promises further information and asks his family not to divulge Conter's posting.\n\nA second telegram, dated Jan. 6 reported that Conter was alive and would contact his family.\n\n\"I'd already sent word, even before the first one got there,\" he says. \"So they knew.\"\n\nThough Conter turned around the first time he ventured toward the sunken Arizona, he has been back since, to see it with other survivors.\n\nHe joined the USS Arizona Reunion Association and stays in touch with a few of the remaining survivors. One, Joe Langdell, lives about 40 miles away in Yuba City.\n\nHe keeps up with what the military does, and some of it irritates him. Discipline seems less important than it was in his day. Too many strategic decisions come down from Washington instead of from the commanders on the ground.\n\nAnd he has watched with dismay the changes in survival training. He once helped design programs that sent soldiers into the wilds for days or weeks at a time. Now, some courses require less than a week of field time.\n\n\"You can't get a guy hungry in three or four days,\" Conter says.\n\nBut there are moments when he knows what he did meant something. His old co-pilot in the New Guinea days was asked once if he'd had survival training for the war.\n\n\"He said, 'I had survival training in the ocean. We had survival training on the job. And my co-pilot, Lou Conter, saved my life.'\"\n\nConter stares at his hands.\n\n\"Some things,\" he says, \"you don't know about what they'll mean until years later.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS\n\nOnce a month or so, Clarendon Hetrick's phone rings with a call from Utah. On the other end of the line is an old shipmate from the USS Saratoga, the aircraft carrier where Hetrick worked as a mechanic through most of World War II.\n\nFor an hour or so, the two men talk. They catch up. They trade stories. Not war stories, usually, not unless one of them has had it out with a doctor or a pushy clerk. Just stories, the kind buddies tell each other.\n\n\"He's there anytime I call him,\" Hetrick says. \"He's there for me. I guess he'd do anything he could for me. He's more like family than just a friend.\"\n\nHetrick, who is 91, has outlived most of the men he knew on the Saratoga. He is one of nine living survivors from the attack on the USS Arizona, the battleship he boarded in 1941 when he was 17.\n\nHe will answer questions about that December day when he escaped the burning wreckage of the Arizona, reciting as many of the details as he can remember. The new shoes he left on the deck of the sinking ship, the ones he intended to retrieve later. The shock of jumping into a harbor knowing he couldn't swim.\n\nBut he kept most of it to himself until he started meeting up with other survivors, years after he retired from the military.\n\n\"I was always wanting to learn more when I was younger,\" says Hetrick's younger son, Robert, who lives not far from his dad in Las Vegas. \"But I had a brother in Vietnam who didn't want to talk about it at all, so I guess I realized if they want to talk, they'll talk. That was the way it was.\"\n\nHetrick shrugs, trying to get comfortable in the recliner. \"It just didn't appeal to me to bring it up,\" he says.\n\nFires still burned on the broken USS Arizona the morning after the Japanese ambush. Hetrick slept on the battleship USS Tennessee, which had been moored just ahead of the Arizona along Ford Island.\n\nThe Tennessee took hits in the attack, but two of the armor piercing bombs, the kind that sunk the Arizona, failed to detonate. Debris from the Arizona showered the Tennessee's stern and started fires, but the vessel stayed afloat.\n\nHetrick took a motor launch to the receiving station on shore, where he and other survivors were allowed to shower and given a change of clothes. The men followed orders in a fog of wonderment and confusion.\n\n\"We didn't hear much from the outside at first,\" Hetrick said. \"It hadn't really sunk in what had happened.\"\n\nThe Navy began assigning sailors to new postings. Hetrick was sent to the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. The ship remained anchored outside Pearl Harbor for most of a month as U.S. commanders planned their next move against the Japanese in the South Pacific.\n\nOne day, a Navy officer came on board and asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for an assignment in the aviation section. Hetrick thought about it. He liked the idea of working as an aircraft mechanic, so he volunteered.\n\n\"They gave me 30 minutes to get off the ship and catch a transport to San Diego for training,\" he said. \"It didn't take me that long. I had one pair of dungarees and that was it, that and a towel and shaving gear.\"\n\nThe Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor not long after. It never returned, crippled in the Battle of the Coral Sea and scuttled by the Navy to keep the enemy from salvaging her.\n\nAfter about six months of training in San Diego, Hetrick returned to Honolulu and joined the USS Saratoga, the sister ship of the Lexington. He worked on board as a mechanic for a torpedo squadron and ended up in charge of the hydraulic shop.\n\nThe Saratoga sailed across the South Pacific, to Guam, the Philippines, around New Guinea. Hetrick was on board during battles at Midway and Wake Island and for the U.S. invasion of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The Saratoga was attacked by six Japanese suicide bombers within about 24 hours.\n\n\"I put on two life jackets,\" Hetrick said. \"I told another kid if they come back again tonight, I'm leaving.\"\n\nHetrick earned a Purple Heart for wounds during one of the bombing raids.\n\nThe Saratoga had returned to Pearl Harbor by the time the Japanese surrendered. The Navy loaded 5,000 bunks on board, along with a row of portable latrines, and the Saratoga sailed to San Francisco, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge with toilet paper streamers and thousands of sailors who needed something to do.\n\nHetrick was still just 21 by then, but a seasoned sailor who shared little in common with the 17-year-old kid who left high school and joined the Navy on his parents' signature.\n\n\"I didn't have the slightest idea what would happen when I signed up,\" he said. \"I decided I'd do whatever they told me to. When they said, 'grab your sea bags and let's go,' I did.\"\n\nWhen he first arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hetrick wasn't even old enough to buy a beer until he found a place where they didn't ask questions if a guy was in a service uniform.\n\nNow, stateside again, Hetrick reported to a Navy station in San Diego, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Jeanne. As his stint was about to end, the Navy decided to transfer him back to Pearl Harbor. He asked if Jeanne could come with him.\n\n\"They said, 'If you re-enlist, we'll send her over.' I said, 'You send her over, I'll re-enlist.' I'd been told things like that before. They wouldn't send her over so I didn't re-enlist.\"\n\nBut Hetrick couldn't find work, so inside of six months, he signed up for the Navy Reserve. He was sent to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station up the coast in Orange County.\n\nIn 1949, the newly created U.S. Air Force was trying to fill it out its ranks with experienced support crews, almost begging for mechanics who knew the aircraft. Hetrick saw a new opportunity and joined.\n\n\"On the day I swore into the Air Force, I was still in my Navy uniform,\" he said. \"Three months later, I was in Korea.\"\n\nHe worked his way up to crew chief on a squadron of B-26 bombers,\n\nAfter 18 months overseas, he returned to Langley Field in Virginia. (\"Two of us with the same rank were up for the same kind of job,\" he said. \"He wanted the east coast, I wanted the west coast. He got the west coast and I got the east coast. So you see how that works.\")\n\nFrom Virginia, he went to Utah, to France and then to Albuquerque, where he retired in November 1961.\n\nHe was on his own once again, he and his young family. They moved to Modesto, Calif., where he got a job driving a produce truck in the fruit orchards.\n\n\"They paid me by the day,\" he said. \"After 36 hours, I still hadn't put in a day. I asked the boss, 'how many hours is in a day for you?' He said, 'whatever I can get out of you.' I quit. I wasn't working for nothing.\"\n\nHe hired on with a farm labor contractor and within a year, he and a guy he worked with started their own business, contracting with the orchard owners to harvest crops. They covered the growing seasons: cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, grapes.\n\nThe venture was working out well. Until his partner ran off with all the money.\n\nHetrick recovered. He built a reputation as a guy who could bring in the harvest on time.\n\nAround 2005, he and Jeanne moved to Bullhead City. A few years after that, they left for Las Vegas, where their son, Bob, and his family help them get around.\n\nLas Vegas seems to like Hetrick. He was at a restaurant last summer and someone noticed his USS Arizona cap. He didn't have to pay for dinner.\n\nHetrick turns a rusted chunk of metal over in his hands, running his fingers along the curves and edges. It is a piece of rigging used to secure a mooring line from a ship.\n\nFrom the USS Arizona.\n\nHe first visited the Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor on the 50th anniversary of the attack and has returned since.\n\n\"It gets your breath when you first see it,\" he says. \"It's hard to explain.\" He thinks back. \"You know, you can see where I came out of, the hatchway. There's a little air bubble. It's the same place where the oil is leaking\" — oil stores aboard the ship that, even today, still seep to the surface — \"that's where I got out from below.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hetrick returned to Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary of the Japanese attack. He had visited before, but this trip meant more. He brought all of his family: his wife Jeanne, his three sons and their families. And he was allowed to visit a part of the Arizona few people ever see.\n\nDuring construction of the memorial, the Navy sliced off pieces of the Arizona's wreckage to make room for the structure that sits above the sunken ship today. The pieces – the largest is about as long as a bus – sit in a salvage yard on the Waipi'o Peninsula on Oahu. The Navy occasionally cuts away small bits of the wreckage for memorials.\n\nFor Hetrick, the section of mooring line links him to those final moments of the Arizona. He will tell his story if he's asked and he will remember details along the way.\n\n\"I remember hearing explosions at first,\" he says. \"It sounded like someone shooting guns. You don't fire guns in port, so I ran out real quick to see what was happening. I saw one airplane, with a big red meatball on the side. Nobody could debate what that was, no question about it.\"\n\nHe remembers the crewman trying to climb a ladder to escape through a hatchway on the deck. The man told him later he had broken both his hips in one of the explosions and had survived only because Hetrick was there to urge him on.\n\nHetrick still likes to talk about the new shoes he bought the day before the attack in Honolulu. As he prepared to jump off the burning ship, he took the shoes off and set them on the quarterdeck.\n\n\"I left them there and hoped to get them back,\" he says. \"I ain't seen 'em since.\"\n\nHe remembers when the order was given to abandon ship. He jumped into the harbor, even though he had never passed his swimming test.\n\n\"When somebody says get out of here and you're on a hundred tons of ammunition, well, you don't question it,\" he says. \"If somebody in authority said do something back then, you didn't question it. I think that's what kept me living to this day.\"\n\nHe's not sure he'd have learned that lesson if he hadn't enlisted in the Navy. He says that decision was the best thing he could have done.\n\n\"I'd do it a hundred times more,\" he says.\n\nPROVO, Utah\n\nKen Potts eases around the side of the pool table, waving toward items like a museum tour guide in a back room.\n\n\"This shows where all the ships were,\" he says, pointing at a map depicting Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. \"There's the battleships … there's the Nevada, the Arizona, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, Maryland, the Oklahoma. The California was way down here.\"\n\nHe stops in front of a newspaper, the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with the headline: \"WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES\"\n\n\"That's one of the first extras that was put out that day,\" Potts says. \"I bought it at the receiving station in Pearl Harbor. It's in good shape for a paper.\"\n\nFarther down the paneled wall hangs a painting of the USS Arizona, the battleship Navy recruit Potts boarded in December 1939. By 1941, he worked the cranes on the ship, a job that entailed retrieving the Arizona's small seaplanes after they landed on the water.\n\nHe points out the cranes and the locations along the ship where he would tie up the motor boats he piloted to fetch supplies and ferry sailors to and from shore. He gazes at the picture.\n\n\"They were saying, when it first started, some of the ones whose station was up here – \"\n\nHe traces his finger up onto the main forward mast, to the crow's nest and the bridge. He clears his throat. \"They tried to jump off. Some of 'em made it, some of 'em landed on the deck. That was the end of it.\"\n\nA moment passes. He returns his attention to the cranes and the catapults that flung the seaplanes into flight.\n\n\"Once after we crossed the equator, one of the planes came back,\" he says. \"The sea was real rough when it came in and the sharks started gathering around. They called the Marines out with rifles to protect the plane and the guys while we hauled it in.\"\n\nPotts was returning to the Arizona with fresh produce when the first Japanese bombers dove into Pearl Harbor. He climbed aboard the ship, ducking to avoid bullets from the gunner planes. He helped rescue some of his shipmates. Seventy-three years later, he is one of just nine survivors of the attack on the Arizona.\n\nHe keeps the mementos from his experience – the maps, the photos, the clippings, the medals, the painting – in a room behind a door on the side wall of the living room in the house where he has lived for 54 years. He doesn't like to talk about the attack. Sometimes he can't control his emotions, so he declines speaking requests.\n\nBut he is proud of his service, of the other sailors on the Arizona. And there's a trophy in the corner the paneled room that means as much as anything else there.\n\nA few weeks after the war started, sometime in early 1942, Potts opened a letter from his mother. Why is the FBI checking up on you, she wanted to know. Someone from the bureau had been asking questions. He heard the same stories from his grandmother and his aunts.\n\nHe didn't know what to tell them. It scared him a little. Potts was working aboard an oil tanker, making short runs out of the harbor to refuel ships anchored off the coast. In the chaotic days following the Dec. 7 ambush, the Navy wasn't letting ships into the harbor, fearful the Japanese might send in more bombers.\n\nFinally, after a few weeks on the tanker, Potts was handed a new assignment. He would work in the port director's office, delivering sealed packets to the captains of Navy ships. Inside the packets were the captains' new orders, military secrets, classified information that required clearance to handle.\n\nThat's why the FBI was nosing around me, Potts thought.\n\n\"These captains of the ships, when they left the states, they had no idea where they were going, just that they're going via Pearl Harbor,\" Potts said.\n\nHe resumed one of his old jobs from the Arizona, piloting motor launches from the receiving station out to the Navy ships.\n\nPotts was based out of the port director's office – there were two, one at the harbor, one on the ninth floor of the Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu – but he logged most of his hours at the controls of the motor boat, a Jeep or a station wagon.\n\n\"The station wagon was for the captains of some of the ships that would come in,\" he said. \"Not Navy ships, other ships. The Navy captain who lived on Waikiki Beach gave a lot of parties and invited these guys. I had to take them to the parties and sit there until it was over.\"\n\nThe parties sometimes dragged into the early morning hours.\n\n\"It was boring,\" Potts says. \"But it was a lot better than being shot at.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his thoughts on the work in the office. He tried not to remember the days after the attack. The day when they assigned him and a crew of divers to a motor launch and sent them to the Arizona to remove bodies of dead sailors.\n\n\"When they dropped that bomb that made our ammunition explode, it dang near broke the ship in two, so we couldn't go anywhere forward of that,\" he says. \"We took all the bodies we could find.\"\n\nWhen he reaches that part of his story, he stops. He can't relive those images anymore. He describes the store of booze they pulled out of safe and the money.\n\n\"One day our boat was stacked with two dollar bills,\" he said. \"They paid everybody in two dollar bills back then. We hauled it all back in.\"\n\nPotts stayed in Honolulu until the end of the war. He finally received his orders to return to the states. He would sail to San Francisco on one of the cruise ships refitted to move troops, the Lurline, or maybe the Matsonia.\n\nAs he was packing, a buddy warned him that his possessions would be searched at the port in San Francisco. If they found anything that belonged to the Navy or hadn't been approved, they'd take it.\n\nPotts picked up the Colt 45 he'd found on Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. The gun took away some of the terror he had felt from the moment he saw the first bomber, the panic he felt when he found the armories on board the ship locked. With a gun, he could defend himself. He had held on to it through the war.\n\nBut he didn't want to start his civilian life in the brig, so he left it in Honolulu.\n\n\"We got into San Francisco,\" he says, \"and they never even opened my bags. Never would've found it.\"\n\nHe bought another gun in the states and he is never far from it. A pistol sits on top of his television at home. He keeps it with him when he travels. And he keeps it loaded.\n\n\"It ain't worth a damn if it ain't loaded,\" he says.\n\nPotts returned to Illinois in late 1945 to await his formal discharge, hanging out in Chicago. He was still active, so would report to the Navy Pier each morning to check a list for the names of sailors who had been given duties for the day. His name never appeared and he would leave for the day.\n\n\"I came back to the pier one morning and my name was on the list to do KP work,\" he says. Kitchen patrol. Mess hall duty. Peeling potatoes.\n\n\"I went and found the head guy and by the time I got through explaining things to him,\" Potts says, \"my name was never on that list again.\"\n\nHis mother had moved to Decatur, Ill., by then, so he followed and took a job at a hardware store. He started chatting up a regular customer, a contractor, and got a job building houses.\n\n\"What houses they built!\" Potts says, shaking his head. \"That lumber was so damn green then, we used to kid we had to shoot the squirrels out of it.\"\n\nHe wasn't happy where he was, so he loaded up his big 12-cylinder Lincoln Zephyr and headed west. He stopped in the small town of Payson, Utah.\n\n\"They said what a wonderful place it was to live, with jobs and everything, so I bought a little place up in Spanish Fork,\" he says, \"I'm still looking for that easy money.\"\n\nWith his experience running cranes on the Arizona, Potts figures he could have landed a decent job at the Geneva Steel operation, but he didn't want to work shifts, so he worked as a carpenter again and eventually went into the used car business with a friend.\n\nHe moved to Provo and sold cars until 1990. He and his wife, Doris, have lived in the same house for 54 years.\n\nThe paneled room behind the door in the living room of the Provo house is filled with trophies of almost any imaginable sort. Two deer racks (his wife shot one, his son the other). Guns. Knives. A bow. An impressive collection of restaurant menus from 30 years of cross-country searches for used cars.\n\nAnd in the back corner, a real trophy. It sits a little higher than most items, but not necessarily on a platform. It fit in that location. And it holds deep meaning for Potts, even though he did nothing to win it.\n\nPotts had not returned to Honolulu in the decades since he left for San Francisco in 1945. He wasn't ready to see it all again, to sharpen the memories he'd tried to dull.\n\nIn 2006, one of his sons offered to take Potts to Hawaii for the 65th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He stayed on the 17th floor of a hotel on Waikiki Beach. He visited the memorial and was relieved to see the builders got it right.\n\n\"It's one of the best actual memorials I've seen,\" he says. \"It's where the war started.\"\n\nFive years later, in 2011, he got a call from the band director at Timpview High School in Provo. The marching band had been invited to fly to Pearl Harbor and perform at activities commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack.\n\nThe band members had decided they wanted to honor survivors from that day. Would Ken be willing to go as a guest of honor? The band would cover all expenses for him and Doris.\n\nPotts was touched. He could see the band was sincere. To prepare for the trip, they were studying World War II history, attending lectures, writing research papers. They offered to perform at a gathering of Utah survivors. How could he say no?\n\n\"Talk about treating you like royalty,\" he says. He was able to visit the national cemetery at an area called the Punch Bowl. He watched the band perform and stood as a survivor of the Arizona, one of the sailors who lived. He went out to the floating memorial.\n\n\"I got the lay a wreath in front of the names of the fallen,\" he says quietly.\n\nWhen he returned home, he got another call from the band director. The band had won a trophy in one of the competitions during their stay in Honolulu. They had voted. They were dedicating it to Potts and wanted him to have it.\n\nHe squeezes past the pool table, past the photos and the maps and the medals. Here is a story he will tell, a memory he will keep.\n\nThe trophy sits on a small white base that raises it above other items on a shelf. It is about three feet tall, with a carved island figure on top and the silhouette of a Hawaiian warrior on a plaque. The inscription reads \"Spirit of Aloha Award, Timpview High School Marching Band.\"\n\nHe touches the trophy.\n\n\"It's my pride and joy.\"\n\nLA MIRADA, Calif.\n\nFor 30 years, Lauren Bruner punched a clock at a manufacturing plant south of Los Angeles, a World War II veteran in a landscape crawling with them.\n\nNo one knew much about Bruner's years in the Navy, not the early years anyway. The easy stories he'd tell. The ones that gave him nightmares, the stories from the day he nearly burned to death, he kept to himself.\n\nYet in a place where you couldn't cross the street without running into a war vet, Bruner was not just another ex-sailor who made it home. Only 335 men survived the bombing of the USS Arizona, the mighty battleship whose loss at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, inspired a nation to go to war.\n\nBruner was one of them.\n\nBy 1991, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the number of living Arizona crewmen had shrunk. Survivors' groups wanted to find all of them so their stories would not be lost.\n\nA woman from Illinois drew Bruner's name. No one among the groups knew where he was or what he was doing, but the woman persisted. She tracked him to the Los Angeles area, then started a phone search.\n\nFinally, she located some of Bruner's tax records and found his address and telephone number.\n\n\"No one knew where the hell I was,\" Bruner says. \"I was here all the time. When they sent me my discharge, I just stayed here.\"\n\nThe woman helped connect Bruner with other survivors from the Arizona and Pearl Harbor. He finally found people who understood his experience.\n\n\"I never talked about it much then,\" he says. \"I just didn't want to. I still get to the point when I'm talking about it, first thing you know, I go to bed at night, wake up and can't sleep for a week.\"\n\nBruner, who turned 94 in November, is now one of nine living USS Arizona crewmen who survived the ship's sinking. He has been telling his story to an author, Ed McGrath, who is working on a book and a film about Bruner's escape from a collapsing tower on the ship.\n\nThe survivors' group that found him was right, he has concluded: The stories of the Arizona should not die with the men who lived them.\n\n\"The kids coming up now have never heard of it,\" he says, his voice tinged with sadness and dismay. \"Never heard of it.\"\n\nBruner was at his battle station in an anti-aircraft gun director, a metal box on the forward mast of the Arizona, when an armor-piercing bomb ignited the ship's powder magazine. The fireball from the explosion engulfed the six men in the box and trapped them.\n\nA sailor on the deck of the repair ship Vestal spotted the men and threw a line across. Their skin charred and falling off, the men crawled down the line to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the sinking ship.\n\nHe won't talk much about the escape, or about the men who didn't make it across. Nightmares invade his sleep when he remembers those final moments.\n\nFrom the Vestal, Bruner was taken to the USS Solace, a hospital ship in the harbor. The Solace dispatched motor boats to the Arizona to rescue wounded sailors and her crew pulled others from the water.\n\nBruner was burned over more than two-thirds of his body. He had taken a bullet to the back of his leg as he was climbing the tower, but the burns were far worse. He stayed aboard the Solace about a month. In January, another ship took him to San Francisco to the Navy hospital on Treasure Island.\n\nHe was treated there for four months. Before the war started, a hospital stay that long would have earned a sailor a discharge, but not anymore. He knew he was near release the day an officer came by and launched into a pep talk about the war and the Navy's role in it.\n\n\"I got another ship for you,\" the officer said at last.\n\n\"OK,\" Bruner said. \"What's up with this one?\"\n\n\"It's a brand new destroyer, the Coghlan, DD-606,\" he said, \"built right here in 'Frisco.\"\n\nAs the war with Japan intensified, the Navy was building new warships as fast as it could. And the ships needed experienced sailors.\n\nBruner was put in charge of the gun batteries. The ship carried four 5-inch anti-aircraft guns and six half-inch machine guns, and, initially, five 21-inch torpedo tubes. The guns used the same type of control mechanisms Bruner had mastered on the Arizona. Sight-setters and pointers would locate targets visually and determine their distance and range. An electro-mechanical computer would aim the guns.\n\n\"I had to start training the new recruits on every machine,\" Bruner said. \"The new ones, they didn't know beans.\"\n\nBruner looked each recruit in the eyes to determine the right job, but he wasn't testing their mettle, not yet. He wanted men with eyes set in the right place on their face. He looked for what he called medium spacing. With eyes too close or two far apart, a crewman could deliver faulty readings.\n\nThe Coghlan left San Francisco in September 1942 and sailed toward Pearl Harbor for an assignment. The ship was still a day away from Honolulu when the captain received new orders. The ship was to turn around and steam toward Alaska.\n\nThe Japanese military had established strategic outposts in the Aleutian Islands and had its eye on Alaska. Japan wanted the northern Pacific to control its shipping routes and block U.S. attacks from that direction.\n\nThe Coghlan approached the Aleutians in October, as winter was pushing fall aside. The sea turned rough, tossing the ship with 40-foot swells, bouncing the vessel like a rubber ball in a washing machine.\n\n\"When we got up into the Aleutians, we started banging on the Japanese that had already landed,\" Bruner said. \"We'd patrol at night. They were trying to replenish submarines or send smaller ships in. We'd go out and blow them up.\"\n\nBy winter, temperatures plunged below zero. The Coghlan's crew battled just to keep the guns free of ice as they headed toward their next target.\n\n\"We had to have two crews, a regular crew and a stand-by crew lined up waiting,\" Bruner said. \"We'd send two guys out to knock the icicles off the guns, then they'd high-tail it back in. By the time they were back, the icicles were forming again and two more guys would go out.\"\n\nThe Coghlan supported Army landings and Navy bombing runs. In March, the crew turned back Japanese forces in the Battle of Komandorski.\n\nLate in the year, after an overhaul in San Francisco, the Coghlan returned to patrol duty off the Aleutians with a half dozen other U.S. vessels. The ships encountered a Japanese fleet, two big cruisers, six destroyers, some troop ships, and engaged.\n\n\"We lit into them, started firing on them,\" Bruner said. \"This went on for four straight hours. We got into a run-and-gun battle. One of our cruisers, the heavy cruiser, got hit and water got into the oil. They were dead in the water.\"\n\nFinally, the four U.S. destroyers were ordered to mount a torpedo run.\n\n\"We took off,\" Bruner said, \"firing just as fast as we could. We got as close as 5,000 yards, which was point-blank for those ships. We cut the torpedoes loose.\"\n\nThe Americans stopped the Japanese ships and wiped out some of the top officers. The Coghlan turned back, almost spent. Another five minutes, Bruner figured, and they'd have run out of ammunition.\n\nBruner and the Coghlan returned to Honolulu and finished out the war in the South Pacific. The ship accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines and was anchored in the harbor off Nagasaki, Japan, when the second atomic bomb exploded.\n\nBruner toured Nagasaki in a Jeep with other Navy officers and chief mates. A few days later, the drove through the crumbling streets of Hiroshima. The cities were in ruins. But the war was over.\n\n\"When I got back home, my doctors here wanted to know about my medical background,\" Bruner said. \"I would tell them. They said, 'You should have been dead a long time ago.'\"\n\nHe finished his stint in the Navy in Shanghai, working shore patrol the way he did back in Honolulu. He was cut loose in San Francisco and returned to Los Angeles, where he had married a girl back in late 1942.\n\nOne day, a young fellow knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself. \"I'm planning to marry your wife's sister, but I've got to have somebody take my place at work. I wanted to know if you could do it for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nBruner thought it an odd request. He asked what the fellow did.\n\n\"I'm a painter,\" he said. \"A brush painter.\"\n\nBruner laughs as he remembers the conversation.\n\n\"Well, I'd brushed enough paint on that damn ship, I figured I could do it,\" he says. \"I said, 'sure, I'll take it.' I still had to wait 29 years for that guy to come back and take his brush back.\"\n\nHis new employer manufactured industrial refrigeration units. Bruner started as a painter, trained as a carpenter, then helped start a new sheet-metal department. Almost three decades later, he was the plant manager, second-in-command.\n\nThree months before he would mark 30 years with the company, he was let go, bought out like a lot other older workers in those days.\n\nBy the time the woman from Illinois found him, he was ready to face his past.\n\nBruner lives alone , in a post-war neighborhood in the far northern edges of Orange County. Trains run close enough to hear the horns during the day, but not close enough to make them a nuisance.\n\nAn avocado tree grows in the backyard. Bruner's neighbor, who has become a close friend and a source of transportation, picks the fruit to keep it from rotting on the ground. Long a bachelor again, Bruner has also entertained lady friends from time to time.\n\nBruner keeps mementos of his time on the Arizona in the sitting room. Framed medals. Photos of the ship and other survivors at reunions in Honolulu. A sign over the arched door marks the room as \"Captain's Quarters.\"\n\nFor a long time, he didn't think he would ever return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nNow, Bruner prepares for his next trip in the Captain's Quarters. He will meet three other survivors in Hawaii for their last reunion. He looks forward to his time with the guys from his years in the Navy.\n\nThe first couple of trips back to Hawaii were difficult. The ones after that were, too.\n\n\"It never gets easy to go back,\" he says.\n\nSo why go back?\n\n\"To see the people I knew back in those days,\" he says. \"They were very good days before the war. I even had a couple of dates with girls.\"\n\nHis mouth quirks into a smile.\n\n\"I was on a date on that Saturday night with a gal I'd been running around with,\" he says. He doesn't need to say which Saturday night by now. \"We're were out and around. We were going to have a date the next day.\n\n\"The next day never came.\"\n\nMORRIS, Okla.\n\n\n\nLonnie Cook was born in this rural town south of Tulsa, not long after it was founded as a stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway. Only a few hundred people lived there then. Today, the population can almost reach 1,500 when everyone is home.\n\nCook enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and was assigned to the USS Arizona, one of the largest battleships in the fleet with a crew that, at full complement, numbered more than 1,500.\n\nAbout a year after he boarded the ship, he ran into a young recruit named Clyde Williams, a fellow from Okmulgee, Okla., a few miles down the road from Morris. All those sailors from all those places and here was a guy who was practically a neighbor.\n\n\"I was back here on leave before the war started and he was here too,\" Cook says. \"We picked up a couple of girls and made the rounds. Then we had to go back.\"\n\nCook was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Williams was in the Arizona's band.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Cook was changing clothes at his locker, savoring the thought of a day in Honolulu with the $60 he'd won in a craps game the night before. Williams was on deck, tuning up to play for colors, an early call after the previous day's fleet Battle of the Bands on shore.\n\nMinutes later, the Japanese attacked and the Arizona was on fire, sinking beneath the surface.\n\nCook made it off alive. He returned after the war to his home along the railway in eastern Oklahoma. By then, he'd seen the world, witnessed history before it was history. His ships steamed across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal to Africa. He fought with other sailors in the Battle of Midway and watched the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nBack on land, Cook followed welding jobs from Kentucky and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and Long Island, west to North Dakota and Wisconsin and finally to a ranch house in Salinas, Calif., where he raised a family and stayed put for almost 30 years.\n\nBut one day and one place in Cook's 94 years seem to embody all the rest, the day in December 1941 when the young sailor from Oklahoma escaped the ship that sent America to war.\n\nSeven decades later, he is one of nine living survivors from the Arizona. His story is always in demand, though he'd just as soon not tell it in front of a lot of people. He remembers all the details and most of what happened later.\n\nAnd he still likes to talk about that other young fellow from Oklahoma, the one who didn't make it home.\n\nWhen he left Morris the first time in 1939 after high school, Cook wasn't sure where he'd end up. Jobs were few, so he set off for Warner, Okla, with the idea of playing football at Connors State Agricultural College.\n\n\"They told me the team was already picked,\" he said. \"I said goodbye and left.\"\n\nHis mother suggested Hills Business College in Oklahoma City. He enrolled, but after a couple of weeks, the noisy streetcars and the police sirens kept him up all night.\n\n\"I went back and told my mother I wasn't going up there anymore,\" he said.\n\nBy April 1940, the Navy seemed like a good idea and by summer, he was on board the Arizona, stationed at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nHe was assigned a battle station in the No. 3 gun turret. His job was to put the primer in the big 14-inch gun. Other crewmen would roll out the shell, use a mechanical device to ram it in, then load four bags of powder behind it. The primer went in last, before the end of the gun was sealed shut.\n\n\"From down inside, it wasn't too bad when they fired it,\" Cook said. \"It was like a hard jolt.\"\n\nCook made it to his battle station on Dec. 7, 1941, but the Arizona was moored in a cramped harbor and couldn't have fired the big guns even in a prolonged assault. Cook and the other men stayed below deck until the smoke from a fire forced them to leave.\n\nThe bomb that shattered the Arizona's bow exploded as Cook and the others climbed out of the turret. He stepped off the deck into a motor launch as the ship was sinking.\n\nThe next morning, the Arizona was still burning as oil flowed out of her full tanks. No one seemed to be in charge on Ford Island, where Cook had spent the night. He met up with some of the guys from the turret crew and they hopped a boat to shore, where there was a call for volunteers to join the Navy's destroyers.\n\n\"We said we'd volunteer if they'd put two or three of us together on the same ship,\" he said. \"They agreed.\"\n\nCook was assigned to the USS Patterson, then two months later, transferred to the Aylwin, a destroyer that had been moored at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 and engaged the bombers as the attack began.\n\nIn February, the Aylwin was part of a U.S. task force preparing for a raid on a Japanese base at Raubal, on the island of New Britain near Australia. Enemy patrol planes spotted the ships and the raid was canceled. As the ships turned around, a squadron of enemy bombers appeared. The ships sent up their own planes and turned back the assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Aylwin joined a task force in the Coral Sea with the USS Lexington, one of the Navy's early aircraft carriers. On the morning of May 8, the fighting intensified as American aircraft tried to turn back the enemy planes.\n\nJapanese torpedo bombers hit the Lexington and crippled the big ship. Explosions rocked the vessel and fires burned into the evening. The crew was evacuated and another U.S. destroyer scuttled the Lexington to keep the Japanese from capturing her.\n\nYears later, at a reunion in Tucson, Cook learned that one of his buddies from the Arizona had been sent to the Lexington and was in the Coral Sea when the carrier was attacked. He had settled in New Mexico with his family.\n\nCook got the buddy's telephone number and tried to call him. The buddy wasn't home, but his son-in-law answered.\n\n\"Can you tell me what ship did he go on after the Arizona?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"The Lexington,\" the son-in-law said.\n\n\"Was he on it when it sunk?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was.\"\n\nCook never got a chance to catch up with his buddy, but marveled at the connections he seemed to make from his short stint aboard the Arizona.\n\nA month after the Coral Sea battle, Cook's ship was part of the American forces in the critical Battle of Midway. After that, he steamed north to Kodiak, Alaska, where other Navy ships were trying to turn back Japanese inroads throughout the strategically important Aleutian Islands.\n\nBefore the year was out, Cook was sent to gunnery school in Washington, D.C., and to the South Boston Navy Yard, where he joined the new destroyer Pringle on its shakedown cruise.\n\nAbout halfway through the cruise, the Pringle was ordered to accompany the battleship Iowa to Africa, where President Roosevelt was to attend a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Morocco.\n\nDuring the conference, the Pringle sailed into the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in a river. One day, some smaller boats sailed past. One of the men started yelling.\n\n\"Is there anybody there from Oklahoma?\"\n\nThere were: Cook and another crewman. The man in the boat was from Muskogee, a town about 40 miles east of Morris.\n\nLonnie and Marietta Cook met in Morris after the war, but the road to their home here today winds thousands of miles across the country.\n\nCook was discharged in 1948 in San Diego and stuck around California, where he worked as a metal finisher at Van Nuys manufacturing plant. That didn't last long and he headed back to Morris, where he met Marietta.\n\nShe likes the story of how they tied the knot. He tries to abbreviate it: \"We went to California and got married.\"\n\n\"Tell them the rest,\" Marietta prompts.\n\n\"She went to California and I followed her,\" Lonnie says.\n\nMarietta shakes her head. \"He called me one night and said if you won't let me come to California, I found a lady who's got a new black Buick and I'm going to move to Texas.\"\n\n\"It was a new Mercury,\" Lonnie says.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, come on, then,'\" Marietta says, and in 1950, they wed.\n\nThat's where the cross-country adventures begin. Cook worked in California, mostly welding jobs, until the union he belonged to called a strike. He headed east and landed in Paducah, Ky. From there, he worked jobs in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and back to New York, where he welded 20-inch gas lines going through Brooklyn.\n\nHe returned to Oklahoma again and started his own business, outfitting a one-ton Ford pickup with a winch and other equipment that let him work the oil fields. A while later, he and Marietta were on the road again, to a missile base in Sturgess, S.D., to gas lines in Wisconsin and North Dakota.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Salinas, Calif., just inland from Monterey on the central coast. They bought a small ranch and, while Lonnie continued to work welding jobs, they grew walnuts, almonds, peaches, apples, nectarines, cherries and grapes.\n\n\"I canned 500 quarts of fruit one year,\" Marietta says. \"I really miss it.\"\n\nLonnie finally retired from welding in 1982 and in 1994, the Cooks moved back to Morris. Lonnie had taken up trap shooting and hoped to do a little hunting back home. It turned out little was the right word. He hasn't hunted in a while, though he still reloads his own ammunition on a garage workbench.\n\nAfter so many years of travel, the Cooks have settled into a more tranquil pace. They spoil their granddaughters and can now move on to a new great-granddaughter. Once a week, they motor on into Tulsa, where Marietta takes a china painting class and Lonnie wanders the aisles of sporting-goods stores.\n\nOccasionally, they head into Okmulgee for an evening out at the One Fire, a casino operated by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\nCook has returned to Pearl Harbor three times and he likes the Arizona memorial. It is respectful. He's not so fond of the crowds around Honolulu and doesn't plan to go back.\n\nAs he talks about Pearl Harbor again, other memories surface.\n\nCook was the gun captain on the Pringle at the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. The ship provided fire support for the Marines going ashore. Cook stood on a shelf in the gun mount with his big binoculars and watched the Marines raise the flag to mark the U.S. victory.\n\nAbout a month later, Japanese suicide bombers sunk the Pringle near Okinawa.\n\nDuring his voyage to Alaska, Cook remembers the flying fish, which stirred up the water like a torpedo wake. That was enough to rattle nerves on board the ship, which was at general quarters every day an hour before sundown and an hour before sunrise.\n\n\"The nights up there were already short, so I didn't get much sleep,\" Cook says. \"That's what I'm catching up now. When she says anything, I tell her I'm catching up from the war.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Cooks attended a fund-raising dinner at a local American Legion post. Cook is invited to such events occasionally and sometimes introduced as an Arizona survivor.\n\nAt this one, he was looking around the room and he saw a picture of a sailor way back in the back, in a setting arranged like a memorial. He squinted and thought about where he was.\n\n\"That must be old Clyde Williams,\" he thought, the Arizona band member killed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe walked back there. Sure enough.\n\nIt was Clyde.\n\nROSWELL, N.M.\n\nHis name was Cactus Jack and to his fans in southeastern New Mexico, he was the dulcet-voiced host of Sagebrush Serenade, a program of country music on KSWS radio.\n\nHe was in the studio on Valentine's Day 1955 when a nervous young man walked in. He was the opening act for country superstar Hank Snow that night at the North High School auditorium. He had a record, a new song he was trying out.\n\n\"Would you like to listen to it?\" the young man asked.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Sure, let's see it.\" He put the disc on a turntable and dropped the needle.\n\nWhat he heard wasn't quite country music, but he liked it and he told the kid. Song's got some zip to it, he said. He agreed to play it on his show.\n\nThe song, \"Hound Dog\" and the singer, Elvis Presley, both went over pretty well, the way Cactus Jack remembers it.\n\nFor a lot of people, meeting Elvis and playing one of his first records on the air might sound like one of life's truly unforgettable days. But John Anderson, the Navy chief petty officer who called himself Cactus Jack on the air, had a good head start already.\n\nHe had chased Japanese soldiers along the coast of China three years before America declared war on Japan. In World War II, he fought at Guadalcanal, in the battle of the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. He fought cold and hunger on a ship nearly dead in the ocean off Alaska.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a stuntman for Orson Welles and John Wayne and helped build Alan Ladd's house in the hills outside Hollywood.\n\nAnd he was aboard on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment in history, but one that struck Anderson to his core. There, he lost his twin brother\n\n\"It was a bloody catastrophe, a bloody mess,\" he says. \"I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw that day.\"\n\nAnderson always talks about his brother, Delbert \"Jake\" Anderson, when he tells the story of his own escape from the burning ship.\n\nHe is one of nine living survivors of the Arizona and, at 97, he has amassed a lifetime of unforgettable days.\n\nAnderson grew up in the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota, the son of a prominent local judge. He had five brothers, including Jake, and four sisters, all grouped so close in age that paying for college wasn't practical for their folks.\n\nAs a youngster, Anderson heard stories about the Navy from his uncle, a man named Ray Stokes. Uncle Ray was nearing the end of his career in 1937 when John and Jake both decided to enlist.\n\nJohn was sent from training camp in Illinois to Bremerton, Wash. He was assigned briefly to the Arizona, then to the Saratoga, an aircraft carrier, then, as the Navy tinkered once more with its troop alignment, back to the Arizona.\n\nBefore the big battleship could leave Puget Sound, Anderson volunteered for another mission, joining the small Asiatic Fleet along the coast of China.\n\nAnderson went aboard the USS Edsall, a destroyer that supported various military action at sea and ashore. Japan and China were at war again and America was trying to protect its interests without getting involved in the conflict.\n\n\"We saved people on commercial ships on the seas, we rescued missionaries in the interior of China, we shot up a bunch of pirates,\" Anderson said.\n\nAt Kulangsu, an international settlement on an island off the southern Chinese coast, Anderson's unit ran into the French Foreign Legion, who had been cornered by Japanese soldiers on a high ridge.\n\n\"I'd never seen so many guys with so much guts,\" he said. \"They were holed up behind sandbags, but they never got hit.\"\n\nThe Edsall sailed farther north, then headed to the Philippines, where they played baseball with a group of indigenous Moros, who had fought the United States more than 20 years earlier.\n\n\"We were told to watch out for them, these guys were assassins,\" Anderson said. \"We made friends. We left and never fired a shot at them.\"\n\nIn 1940, Anderson reported to the Arizona once more, joining his brother for the first time since they had enlisted. They would serve together for a little over a year.\n\nThe day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anderson volunteered for duty on the Macdonough, a destroyer that downed at least one of the Japanese attack planes on Dec. 7.\n\nThe ship steamed toward the Asiatic Pacific and soon Anderson was chasing Japanese forces again, only this time the United States was at war. This time the objective was clear.\n\nThat summer, the ship joined others for the invasion at Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, one of the first major assaults against Japan by the Americans. The Macdonough stayed until September, then sailed back on patrol in the Pacific.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Macdonough headed north toward the Aleutian Islands, where Japan was trying to establish strategic strongholds that could control shipping lanes and thwart allied attacks on the Japanese islands.\n\n\"It was rough weather, foggy, raining cold,\" Anderson said. \"Here we are, we can't see the enemy. We can't see our own ships. Then we got hit.\"\n\nThe Macdonough had collided with another destroyer, the Sicard. The ship was dead in the water. The crew unloaded anything they could do without, to keep the damaged hull above the water line. They knew the oil tanker Tippecanoe was out there, but couldn't see her.\n\nFinally, the tanker spotted the destroyer. Anderson spoke to one of the tanker's crew about towing the Macdonough. The fellow he was talking with recognized Anderson's voice and they realized they had served together on the Yangtze Patrol before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe tanker towed them to Adak, Alaska, and from there, another ship took the crippled destroyer to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nOver the next year, Anderson would sail across the South Pacific, joining other ships in the American assault on the Marshall Islands, Parry Island and the Palau Islands. The Macdonough pulled picket patrol often, protecting other troops and guarding against kamikaze attacks by Japanese planes.\n\n\"We made so many landings,\" Anderson said. \"We would go in with a landing party or we furnished artillery for the landing force. Sometimes we never landed, but we kept the line, always watching out for kamikazes.\"\n\nOn a fall day in 1945, John Anderson teetered on the base of a church steeple 110 feet above the ground. The steeple clock chimed and a statue of an angel wielding a sword emerged from an alcove and knocked Anderson off the steeple.\n\n\"Cut!\" a director yelled. A stunt coordinator helped pull Anderson from the pile of cigarette crates that had broken his fall. Anderson had finished his first day as a Hollywood stunt man.\n\nThe job wasn't what he expected in September, when he was discharged from the Navy. He had a ticket home to Minnesota, but decided to find a place to stay and come up with a plan.\n\nAs he walked past a bar, still in his Navy uniform, a fellow popped out the door and looked Anderson up and down, checking him out more closely someone would ordinarily.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Anderson demanded to know.\n\n\"You,\" the fellow said. \"Are you in the Navy?\"\n\n\"I was,\" Anderson said. \"I just got discharged. The war's over.\"\n\n\"Would you like a job?\" The fellow told him to report to the front gate of Sam Goldwyn's studio in Hollywood on Monday morning. He gave Anderson the name of a contact there.\n\nAnderson decided he had nothing to lose. After an initial run-in with the guard at the gate (\"Three weeks ago, I was shooting at people and killing them and I didn't even know who they were,\" he growled at the guard. \"You I know.\") he met his contact and not long after, he was standing in for Orson Welles in a scene from the movie \"The Stranger.\"\n\nIt turned out most of the regular stuntmen were still in the military. The studios needed tough men who could handle dangerous situations. The job paid $700.\n\n\"Next thing you know, I'm in a movie with John Wayne,\" Anderson says years later. \"I didn't have any speaking parts, but I was working for the studio and they paid me.\"\n\nHe got to know Alan Ladd, who had starred in a series of war movies. When the regular stuntmen returned and the studio cut loose the subs, Ladd hired some of them to work on his house in the Holmby Hills above Los Angeles.\n\nAt nights, Anderson was taking classes in meteorology and electronics, trying to learn skills that could help him stand out among all the returning servicemen and women.\n\nOne day, he stopped for coffee at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. He felt a tap on his shoulder. He saw Gene LaRocque, a man he'd served with aboard the Macdonough.\n\n\"Are you out of the Navy, Andy?\" LaRocque asked. When Anderson said he was, his old friend was incredulous. \"Andy, you had 12 years of the damnedest fighting I ever saw. You're the bravest man I ever know. You can't leave the Navy.\"\n\nLaRocque took Anderson to San Pedro, where his current ship was anchored. He introduced him to other officers. By the end of the day, had persuaded Anderson to sign up for the Navy Reserve. Put in eight years at least and you'll have a pension, he promised.\n\nAnderson would serve another 23 years before finally retiring once more.\n\nAnderson's road to the radio booth started in Hollywood, with a screen test at a studio where he had worked. He waited for the result. You have a great voice, he was told. Why not try radio?\n\nSo he did. He started on a small station, playing organ music. An administrator at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, N.M., heard Anderson and talked him into joining the school to help improve its radio station and start a television station.\n\nAnderson picked up and moved to New Mexico. He clashed with the station manager of the radio station and finally quit. Or got fired. Or both. That led to a job in Roswell, the Sagebrush Serenade and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"They played country music because the people here loved that,\" Anderson says. \"Some of the ships I was on had guys who liked to play the guitar, so I knew something about it. The owner said, 'give it a name and say who are. Anything you choose is fine. You're on your own, every day.'\"\n\nAs Cactus Jack, Anderson made a few concessions to his seagoing past.\n\n\"I cleaned up my language,\" he says, admitting he deployed a salty vocabulary, even after leaving active duty. \"In the service, if you didn't use nasty words, you weren't a good sailor.\"\n\nA few years later, a new station owner showed Anderson his plans to start a TV station. He said he wanted Anderson to join the on-air staff. Did he know anything about meteorology?\n\nAnderson smiled. Did he ever. Soon, he became one of the earliest TV weathermen and an evening fixture in Roswell homes, or at least those with televisions.\n\nNot long after he returned to Pearl Harbor near the end of the war, Anderson searched out some of the battle reports from Dec. 7, 1941. He knew his brother hadn't made it off the Arizona alive, but he didn't know much else.\n\nHe found a report by a gunner's mate. The report said most of the guys in the anti-aircraft batteries, where Jake fought, were shot down early in the assault. When the fourth bomb detonated in the powder magazine, anyone left was blown over the side.\n\nAnderson has returned to the Arizona memorial often and has taken his family there. He has met many of his old friends and shipmates. Many have since died.\n\n\"It's always a great thing for me to see them,\" he says. \"That's what I want to remember. The things I don't want to remember was the blood.\"\n\nAlthough he is 97, he decided he couldn't miss a final reunion this year and he bought his tickets early. He wanted one last unforgettable day.\n\nUPDATE: John Anderson died in November 2015, less than a year after this report.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n\n\n\nDonald Stratton completed the paperwork for a concealed weapons permit at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and approached the counter to submit fingerprints.\n\nHe was still adjusting to his new life in Colorado, hundreds of miles inland from his old home in coastal California and more than a mile higher in elevation. He had turned 90 and was starting over again.\n\nAs he waited, he had a feeling he knew what would happen, but he didn't say anything. A clerk tried to complete the process, normally a routine, if messy, step to secure the permit. She returned, puzzled.\n\nThey were having trouble reading his prints, she told Stratton. It was as if he had none.\n\nStratton hesitated, then confirmed her suspicion. His fingers were almost smooth, lacking all but a few of the swirls that create an identity.\n\nStratton told her why: He had been aboard the USS Arizona when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. He survived, but was burned badly over two-thirds of his body. Doctors treated him and he recovered, but the his fingers never healed properly.\n\nThe clerks decided they could not send Stratton away without his permit. They found a way to take prints from the edges of his fingers, enough to satisfy the law.\n\nAs he recounts the experience, he rubs his hands together, then holds them out, turning them over. He pushes his shirtsleeves up to show his arms. He motions toward his gnarled ear. He catalogs the scars and their origin.\n\nThey are the marks of a survivor, 73 years on. They are reminders of a moment in time he can never escape, a moment he sees again and again.\n\n\"Through all that, I never did lose consciousness,\" he says. \"I knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nAs the USS Arizona burned and sunk into the harbor, Stratton and five other men had been trapped on an anti-aircraft gun control platform on the ship's foremast, burned in a fireball when below-deck ammunition exploded.\n\nA sailor on the repair ship Vestal, tied up nearby, spotted them and threw them a line. The men, their charred skin peeling away, climbed hand-over-hand across the line to safety.\n\nStratton and other men climbed into a small boat that took them ashore. They still had to climb onto the dock and then into a truck for a short ride to a Navy hospital. The burn ward filled with the injured. The smell of burned skin filled the air. Doctors and nurses wove among gurneys, administering morphine shots and looking for the victims most in need.\n\nWithin a day or two, someone came into the ward and said a few of the wounded would be sent to California. He asked for volunteers.\n\n\"I'll go,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"No,\" the worker said. \"We don't think you'd make it. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"I want to go anyway,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"Fine,\" the worker said. \"If you can stand up and stay up while we change the linen on this bed, we'll see about it.\"\n\nStratton climbed to his feet and, biting back the pain, he stood and when his bed was ready, he collapsed back into it. By Christmas, he was in a hospital at Mare Island near San Francisco. He stayed there for months. He weighed 92 pounds by the time he was sent to rehabilitation in Corona, Calif. Finally, the Navy gave him a medical discharge.\n\nA year later, he felt better, so he re-enlisted. The Navy wanted to keep him in Idaho, working with new recruits at a boot camp, but he pushed for a seagoing assignment and wound up on the destroyer USS Stack as a gunner's mate.\n\nHe saw action across the South Pacific, patrolled areas where suicide bombers were attacking American destroyers. Once he was awakened by a loud noise and a flash and thought his ship was under attack.\n\nIt wasn't, but the flash was a reminder, as if he needed anything more.\n\nBefore the end of the war, he went to San Diego for gunner's mate school. He finished his training and was discharged in December 1945.\n\nStratton grew up in the tiny prairie town of Red Cloud, Neb., about as far away from an ocean as any place in the country. He joined the Navy because it seemed like a better environment.\n\n\"You either had a nice place aboard a ship and were high and dry or you didn't have anything,\" he reasoned. \"In the Army you were crawling around in the mud and everything else and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nAfter his second discharge, he knocked around Nebraska again, working in his dad's tavern, then on a beer truck, but he grew bored. He decided to head back to the water. In California, he earned his naval seaman's license and went to work on a drilling rig offshore near Santa Barbara.\n\nHe made bargemaster on a huge drilling rig, but yearned for something more interesting, so he got a job as a tender with a commercial deep sea diving business. As a tender, he stayed on the surface, monitoring the divers working on rigs, piers, pipelines, any piece of seaside or seagoing equipment.\n\nStratton logged thousands of miles of travel. Nicaragua. Chile. Colombia. Kuwait. In Alaska, he helped set up platforms that could keep up with tides that rose and fell as much as 32 feet.\n\nIn his dining room in Colorado Springs, he keeps a replica of a hard diving helmet, the kind his divers used. The face plate is glass and around the bottom are screws that would secure it to the diving suit. Stratton falls easily into the memories of his years on diving boats.\n\n\"We worked with a crane barge capable of lifting 700 tons,\" he sys. \"I motioned to crane operator what we needed, what tools to send down.\" He touches the diving helmet. \"I ran the decompression chamber on jobs. Once, I made a dive in a two-man submarine, down in over 1,200 feet of water off Santa Barbara coast. One of the first people to do that.\"\n\nFor years, Stratton wore the scars from the Arizona without talking about them much. Lots of men brought home scars from World War II and Korea. The offshore diving business could leave its own kind of scars.\n\nIn 1966, 25 years after the attack, Stratton returned to Pearl Harbor with his family. In the waters off Honolulu, he confronted his memories. It was the first time Randy, his son, had seen his father cry.\n\nIn the years after, he became active in survivors' groups and started going back to Pearl Harbor more often. At the USS Arizona memorial, he became friends with a National Park Service historian and inspired a Pearl Harbor action figure that the service sold at the gift shop.\n\nIn time, he felt no anger toward the Japanese, but he couldn't forget what they did. Sometimes, Japanese pilots attended memorial ceremonies and some of the other survivors would shake their hands. Stratton could not.\n\n\"Listen, all those men down there on that ship, a thousand of them, they wouldn't do it and I don't think they'd want me to do it,\" he says. \"We can't forget what happened there that day. We can't let it happen again.\"\n\nA while back, Stratton and his wife Velma retired to Yuma and lived there about 15 years. He played a lot of golf, but missed California. They moved to Santa Maria, not far from Santa Barbara, to be near their oldest son, then to Colorado Springs to be near Randy. They will celebrate 65 years of marriage in April.\n\nThe Stratton men have taken up a more personal cause. He wants to secure a proper medal for Joe George, the sailor from the Vestal who helped rescue the six men from the gunner's control tower.\n\nA lot of people agree that what George did was heroic, but the Navy balks at every step, in part because George disobeyed a direct order.\n\n\"He should have the Navy Cross,\" Stratton says. \"He saved six people's lives. Joe saved six lives and he didn't get crap. He refused to cut the line no matter what. As far he was concerned he was saving lives.\"\n\nIn 1971, Stratton was working long hours with a diving outfit on a nuclear power plant project not far from Santa Barbara. He needed a truck to carry equipment back and forth, so he scouted out a car lot and bought a 1965 Chevrolet pickup.\n\nHe kept the truck, held on to it through repairs, engine overhauls, new paint jobs. It sits today in the carport outside his home. He still tools around town in the truck, but it's a classic now, so he drives it almost as often to car shows.\n\nHe can tell stories about his years with the diving crews, but the truck has evolved into a reminder of another time. The license plate reads USS ARIZ. A mural on a white bed cover depicts the USS Arizona and the memorial that floats above it in Pearl Harbor. It identifies Stratton as a survivor of the attack that sank the ship.\n\nWherever he goes on the pickup, people ask him about his experience. Yes, he'll say, he was on the Arizona and he survived. Yes, a lot of brave men died. Yes, some of them were his friends.\n\nHe still remembers the day he saw the Arizona in dry dock at Bremerton, Wash.\n\n\"It was quite a sight for an old flatlander like me to see a 35,000-ton battleship out of the water,\" he says. \"It was a big ship with a lot of metal, I'll tell you.\" He owns a chunk of the ship's burned deck, a reminder he keeps in a box with a few other items.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Stratton ambles down the driveway and fires up the engine. He eases the truck out of the carport, far enough to show it off. He fiddles with the radio.\n\n\"Randy, come and turn on the music box.\" His son reaches in the cab and queues up one of the hundreds of songs he and his daughter downloaded onto the new MP3 player.\n\n\"Lots of big band songs,\" Randy says, as the first bars of a brass line pour from the speakers. \"The stuff he likes.\"\n\nHow lucky can one guy be?\n\nI kissed her and she kissed me\n\nStratton's eyes brighten. A smile spreads across his face as Dean Martin's voice fills the cab.\n\nLike a fella once said\n\nAin't that a kick in the head?\n\nThe smile widens. Almost imperceptibly, he sways.\n\nWEST WARWICK, R.I.\n\n\n\nThe six men stared straight ahead, almost as if they were back in line, at attention. They listened for their names and their service branch. They stayed composed as their stories were told, stories of bravery, of quick thinking. Stories of survival.\n\nEach of the six men were at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes swarmed the Navy fleet in an ambush that would provoke war. On the 70th anniversary of the attack, the men had been brought to the state capitol to receive new honors.\n\nAs each name was read, Rhode Island National Guard Maj. Gen. Kevin McBride presented the man with the Rhode Island Star, one of the state's highest military honors.\n\nWorld War II veterans are a special breed, Lt. Col. Denis Riel said as the men accepted the medals. Without them, Riel said, who knows where we'd be today.\n\nMcBride reached the last man, Raymond Haerry, a 20-year-old coxswain on the day of the assault. Haerry straightened in his seat as his story was told. He had escaped the USS Arizona, the battleship whose losses surpassed any other.\n\nFor Haerry, McBride had a the state's highest military honor, the Rhode Island Cross. Haerry accepted the medal, but found he could not speak. He handed the microphone to his son, Raymond Haerry, Jr., who spoke of his father's courage and resilience.\n\nThree years later, Ray Haerry Jr. holds the cross in his hand, fighting back tears.\n\n\"I hadn't told him he was going to be individually honored that day,\" he says. \"I had to help my father out of his seat. He stood strong and tall right in front of this general. I heard the general say, 'You're a remarkable guy.' I think it was one of the proudest days of my father's life.\"\n\nHis dad has never sought recognition for his service on the Arizona and barely talks about the day of the attack. He will tell his story to people he knows well and trusts, but he is 93 and the details are fading from his memory.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of six Rhode Islanders who had lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor, the only one from the Arizona. Today, he is one of nine remaining survivors from the mighty battleship.\n\n\"I do as much as I can to keep his story alive,\" his son says. \"It's always been my fear that people are going to forget that day, that people are going to forget the sacrifice that was made that day.\"\n\nHaerry ran away from home to join the Navy. He grew up in New Jersey and after high school, enrolled at MIT in Boston. He was smart enough to excel, but started cutting classes not long after the start of his first semester.\n\nHe and a buddy would sneak off campus and hop freight trains to see how far they could get. He missed enough of his classes that he was finally asked to leave. As soon as he turned 18, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nOn the Arizona, he worked on the deck crew. He cleaned and painted day after day, but he also operated the motor boats used to ferry crew members to shore, a job that let him leave the ship periodically.\n\nHaerry had made two runs to shore on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. It was Sunday and some of the crewmen with liberty wanted an early start. He was eating breakfast when he heard the first pops of the attack planes strafing Battleship Row.\n\nHe ran to the anti-aircraft battery, his battle station, but there was no ammunition ready. He could see the planes were flying too low for his guns anyway, but before his crew could figure out their next move, an armor-piercing bomb detonated near the powder magazine beneath the No. 2 gun turret.\n\nHaerry felt the entire ship life out of the water. As it fell, he was thrown from the ship into the harbor. He half-swam, half-walked the 70 yards to Ford Island and manned a mounted machine gun. He spent the rest of the day retrieving bodies from the harbor.\n\n\"He remembers body parts in the water, charred burned bodies that he swam by,\" his son Ray, Jr., says. \"Something had happened that no one could comprehend.\"\n\nHaerry sailed on Navy ships through World War II and again during the Korean conflict. He spent long months on a tender, a vessel that carries equipment, parts and other supplies for ships at sea.\n\nOn one mission, Haerry's tender was tied to a larger ship as the crew delivered supplies and completed maintenance tasks. The sky began to darken and the wind grew. A storm was approaching, a big one by the looks of it.\n\nThe tender didn't want to be tied to the larger ship when the worst of the storm blew through. High winds could slam one ship into the other and sink one or both of the vessels.\n\nHaerry held the rope that connected the ships as another crewman swung an ax to cut it. As the boat heaved, the man with the ax missed and hit Haerry's hand, nearly severing it from his wrist. He did not reach a hospital for several days, but doctors still saved his hand.\n\nA year after World War II ended, Haerry went home for a while and married a girl he'd met not long before. He and Evelyn had their first son, Ray, Jr., in 1947.\n\nFor a while, the young family lived in Puerto Rico as Haerry, now a chief boatswain's mate, drew new assignments aboard his tender.\n\n\"He was out to sea nine months out of the year, only home for three months,\" Ray Jr. says. \"He was very military by then, very disciplined.\"\n\nAfter he returned from Korea, Haerry was promoted to master chief petty officer, signifying his experience and level of service. He had turned down a promotion to ensign, preferring the camaraderie of the enlisted ranks.\n\nAt his request, he was assigned to the officer candidate school in Newport, R.I. He left home at 5 every morning and took a ferry from Jamestown to the Navy base. He liked teaching and liked the chance to instill discipline.\n\n\"I've gotten letters from some of the officer candidates who had my father as an instructor,\" Ray Jr. says. \"They said he was a tough bastard, but that's exactly what they needed.\"\n\nHis service on the Arizona also seemed to give him added credibility among the young sailors. They respected a guy who survived such a horrific attack.\n\nThere was a tradition at the end of training that the graduates would give the chief a silver dollar. Haerry would come home on those days with cigar boxes full of the coins.\n\nFor a long time, Haerry never talked about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He displayed no pictures, kept no mementos that his family knew about. He would answer questions, but in short bursts of description, with no emotion.\n\n\"The only people he would talk to were either very close friends or relatives,\" his son says. \"He'd always have to be prompted.\"\n\nIt took Ray Jr. years, decades to piece together his father's story. He would draw out snippets and stash them away, collecting them until he would weave the barest narrative.\n\nAs anniversaries of the attack passed, Ray Jr. would asked his dad if he wanted to visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor.\n\nNope. He wanted to part of it. He's never been back.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Ray Jr. says. \"To go through that to me is incomprehensible. Nobody was expecting anything like that.\"\n\nHis dad will return finally at his death. Ray Jr. has arranged for his father's remains to be interred in the sunken Arizona, an honor accorded any of the sailors or Marines who survived the attack.\n\nThree years ago, Ray Jr. received a call from a lieutenant colonel in the Rhode Island National Guard. He told Ray about the plans to honor Pearl Harbor survivors at the statehouse. One of the survivors would receive the Rhode Island Cross.\n\nAs they talked, Ray mentioned that his dad had been aboard the Arizona. That caught the lieutenant colonel's interest. He called back a few days later.\n\n\"We found our guy,\" he told Ray Jr.\n\nFive years ago, Haerry moved into a nursing home, He stays in a room on the second floor. Thickets of tangled shrubs and rows of trees are visible from his window.\n\nThe nurse who checks in on him regularly likes Haerry. She prods him to move around more and to leave the room for meals. He has told her about his escape from the Arizona.\n\nRay Jr. seems surprised. \"He told you the story?\" She nods and smiles.\n\nHaerry accepts the chocolate bars his son has brought him. He likes chocolate and is disappointed if Ray Jr. forgets it. There are a few personal photos on the table, but nothing from his years in the Navy.\n\nExcept the cap. The USS Arizona ballcap that almost every survivor owns and wears.\n\nHe doesn't want to answer questions about his war service, shrugging them off or insisting he can't remember the details anymore. But he clutches the cap and puts it on as he sits in an easy chair by the window.\n\n\"These guys were the first heroes of the war, even though the war hasn't been declared,\" Ray Jr. says. \"I think my dad was one of the first American heroes of World War II.\"\n\nHe and his father chat a little. Haerry says he wants lunch delivered to his room, but the nurse says no. You need the exercise. Haerry nods and like a good sailor taking orders from the chief, he pulls himself up with a walker and shuffles off to lunch.\n\nYUBA CITY, Calif.\n\nJoe Langdell found a table in the wardroom of one of the ships moored in Pearl Harbor and sat down with his breakfast.\n\nThree days had passed since Japanese bombers had punched a fiery hole in the Navy's Pacific fleet. Three days since the war started.\n\nCrippled ships still floated around the mooring posts along Ford Island. Repair crews were already at work on the battleships that had survived. Salvage work would begin soon on others. Sailors found food and shelter wherever they could.\n\nLangdell's ship, the USS Arizona, lay dead in the water where she sank 14 minutes into the attack. The mast and towers near the bow tilted at a sickening angle. Fire had blackened much of the structure still visible.\n\nLangdell heard someone enter the room.\n\n\"Are there any officers from the Arizona here?\" he said.\n\nLangdell was an ensign, an entry-level officer, not yet a year in the Navy. He was nervous about volunteering for anything, but he raised his hand.\n\nThe man walked over and looked at Langdell's name tag.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell,\" he said, \"when you're done with your breakfast, you'll report to the pier and you'll be met by a motor whale boat and a party of 20 enlisted men with sheets and pillow cases.\"\n\nWhat is this? Langdell thought.\n\n\"You will go to the Arizona and you will take off all the bodies and body parts above the water line,\" the man said. \"Cover the decks, anywhere you can find them up to the top of the masts.\"\n\n\"So that's what we did,\" he says, staring out at the harbor nearly seven decades later.\n\nLangdell is one of the last nine survivors from the Arizona. At 100, he is the oldest.\n\nHe was on Ford Island when the Japanese attacked, training for new assignment. His own battle station was beneath the gun turret shattered by the last bomb to hit the Arizona. From the shore, he helped wounded men from the water, men whose bodies had been torn apart by bombs and bullets and fire.\n\nBut he could not be prepared for what he found on the charred hulk of the battleship. He still will not talk about it. His younger son believes the experience changed his dad forever.\n\n\"How could it not?\" the son wonders.\n\nLangdell says only this: \"It took two days to take all the bodies. We carefully wrapped them in sheets. The body parts we put in pillow cases. We swept the decks and took the small bones. Everything was taken ashore and properly taken care of.\"\n\nLangdell arrived at Pearl Harbor along a different path than many of the young sailors, who signed up for the service because they were unable to find work as civilians.\n\nBorn in 1914, seven months after the first bolts were tightened on a new battleship in Brooklyn, Langdell grew up wooded agricultural area along the Souhegan River in southern New Hampshire.\n\nHis dad operated a livery stable and a small dairy and later earned money as an auctioneer. The family sold maple syrup distilled from the trees on their farm.\n\nAfter high school, Langdell enrolled at Boston University, working nights to pay for his classes, and in 1938, he earned a degree in business administration. He went to work as a junior accountant for a prominent Boston firm.\n\nBut he became restless. He signed up for a Navy program that allowed college graduates to attend officer candidate school and emerge as ensigns within three months. By early 1941, Langdell was one of the \"90-day wonders\" and drew his first assignment: The USS Arizona.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Langdell asked for a posting on one of the new destroyers the Navy was set to launch. He was soon aboard the USS Frazier, which left the shipyard at San Francisco in July 1942.\n\nThe Frazier patrolled the South Pacific at first, but in early 1943, steamed northward toward Alaska, where Japan was trying to secure positions in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOne day in May, crewmen spotted two periscopes in the water and the Frazier opened fire. The guns hit the periscope. Using its sonar equipment, the ship fired depth charges and eventually sank the enemy submarine.\n\nToward the end the war, Langdell was stationed in the Philippines, at a base in Manila. Among his responsibilities was overseeing the naval officers' clubs in the area.\n\nOne morning, he was at his desk, catching up on paperwork, when he heard a vehicle screech to a halt outside. A young sailor ran in, out of breath.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell, Mr. Langdell, you've got to come here quick,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Langdell asked.\n\n\"It's easier if you come see it,\" the sailor said.\n\nThey hopped in a Jeep and head up the hill toward one of the Quonset huts, the one where liquor for the officers' clubs was stored. As they walked toward it, Langdell reeled at an odor. Alcohol.\n\nInside, he found broken bottles scattered in a soggy soup of booze and cardboard. Someone had stacked the boxes too high and in the humid environment of the island, the cardboard had grown damp and weak.\n\nThe boxes had collapsed.\n\nLangdell was discharged at the war's end and returned to Massachusetts, where his wife, Libby, waited.\n\nJoe had met Elizabeth McGauhy in Chicago half a decade earlier. He was attending midshipman's school at Northwestern University. She was attending an art academy to learn dress designing. They met at a dance at the YWCA on North State Street.\n\nThey danced. They went out for coffee afterward. They continued to see each other and, when Langdell left for Hawaii, they corresponded, often.\n\nAs he prepared for his new posting on the Frazier, Langdell decided to make a move. He asked his brother, Ted, to visit Libby and see if she could cook. The report: Oh, yes, she can cook.\n\nJoe proposed and Libby accepted. They would be married in San Francisco, before the Frazier set sail. The only question was how Langdell would send Libby word about his arrival from Pearl Harbor. The Navy censors would never allow such information in a letter.\n\nLangdell knew Libby was friends with a skater in the Ice Follies, which was summering in San Francisco. He wrote Libby a letter and suggested it would be a good idea if Libby visited her friend on or about a particular date. Libby got the message.\n\nThey were married in an Episcopal Church on Van Ness Avenue. Langdell had borrowed a car, a Dusenburg, for the honeymoon. Libby had arranged stays north of the city. Friends told them when the left the church, keep the water on their left.\n\nWhat they didn't count on was the side-street parking. Langdell took a right turn instead of a left and the newlyweds didn't realize their mistake until they stopped for gas in Gilroy, about 80 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nThe Langdells ended up honeymooning in Monterey and Carmel on the central California coast.\n\nAfter the war, Langdell returned to the family auction business in Massachusetts, but after all those years in Hawaii, the Philippines and in the tropical South Seas, he couldn't readjust to the cold. He and Libby moved west to Walnut Creek east of San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually bought a home-furnishings outlet farther inland and finally built their own store in Yuba City, north of Sacramento. They ran Joe and Libby Langdell's Village Mart for more than 20 years until they retired.\n\nOccasionally, they would close the store and hook a 33-foot trailer to a pick-up truck. They traveled around the country, meeting up with other USS Arizona survivors, with shipmates from the Frazier. Keeping the memories alive.\n\nLangdell returned to Pearl Harbor in 1976. His oldest son had joined the Navy and his first posting was aboard the USS Ouellet, a frigate. The family visited the Arizona memorial and toured other sites near the harbor.\n\nBefore the trip, Langdell hadn't talked much about his years in the war, about his time on the Arizona. Afterward, Langdell sought out other survivors who had formed reunion organizations. He was active in those groups for many years, serving as president of one devoted to the Arizona.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the attack neared, Langdell got a call from a documentary filmmaker. He wanted to interview Langdell for his project. He was also interviewing a Japanese pilot named Zenji Abe, a pilot who had taken part in the raid on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Would Langdell agree to meet Abe on film?\n\nThe two men not only met, they took a boat to the USS Arizona memorial and laid a wreath in front of the wall with the names of the crewmen who died on the ship.\n\nIn the documentary, \"The Life and Death of a Lady,\" Langdell and Abe speak, side by side on the memorial. Abe offered condolences and said he prayed that all their souls were at peace.\n\nLangdell said much more.\n\n\"It is only by the grace of God that I stand here today,\" he said. \"I witnessed your attack from Ford Island. Helpless, I watched your bomb sink the Arizona in nine minutes.\"\n\nSentiment ran high against the Japanese, he said, but also against U.S. leaders whose decisions many questioned in the aftermath. He acknowledged the wreath.\n\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.\"\n\nIn 2006, Langdell walked along the steep shoreline of Ford Island, the Arizona memorial in the background. He told his story as his son, Ted, recorded it on video.\n\n\"The lesson I've learned from that experience is that the 1,177 men entombed on the ship right now will never know the love of a wife or the joy of grandchildren,\" he said. \"It's just not going to happen. We all have to remember that they did not die in vain.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Langdell celebrated his 100th birthday with with his older son, John, who flew in from Spearfish, S.D. On Veteran's Day, he participated once more in a parade through Marysville, the next town over from Yuba City. But he doesn't tell his story anymore, not on his own.\n\nLangdell lives now in a skilled nursing center. He has trouble remembering the past. He struggles to speak at times (though when he's feeling good, he likes to flirt with the nurses). He sits in his wheelchair as his son recites the narrative, keeping his father's story alive.\n\nPhotographs hang on the walls of his room. His wife, Libby, who died two years ago. His kids and grandkids. Pictures of past parades. A framed painting of the Arizona, the repair ship Vestal next to it.\n\nHe likes to wear a cap that identifies him as a veteran of the Arizona.\n\n\"Why do you like the hat, dad?\" Ted asks.\n\n\"It acknowledges to people that I'm a survivor,\" Joe replies, his voice soft. \"The hat represents the Arizona.\n\nTed asks him about the ship.\n\n\"The Arizona was a fighting battleship,\" Joe says. \"One of the last ones…\" He talks about going aboard the Frazier.\n\nLangdell will return to the Arizona once more. When he dies, his remains will be interred under the No. 4 gun turret, with the men who died there and survivors who had died since.\n\nA final tribute.\n\nUPDATE: Joe Langdell died in February 2015, months after this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/bicentennial/2024/11/08/tallahassee-leon-county-history-as-told-by-street-signs-landmarks-gerald-ensley-tlh-200-bicentennial/75964452007/", "title": "Tallahassee, Leon County history as told by street signs, landmarks", "text": "Gerald Ensley\n\nTallahassee Democrat columnist\n\nWhat’s in our names?\n\nFor years, former Tallahassee Democrat columnist and city historian Gerald Ensley shared brief vignettes in the pages of the Tallahassee Democrat on the historical figures and meanings behind the streets that people travel and the landmarks that residents love.\n\nThese waypoints tell the tale of Florida's capital city.\n\nRepublishing his Local Names series has been one of the most repeated requests from readers to the Tallahassee Democrat. So here, today, for the first time, we republish his complete collection, lightly updated and edited. It's long, so bookmark it, settle in and enjoy the story of us.\n\nHappy 200th birthday, Tallahassee and Leon County.\n\nConcrete posts once marked Tallahassee's streets\n\nFor more than 40 years, Tallahassee streets were identified by concrete, waist-high posts in the ground — several of which remain around Tallahassee. The four-sided posts were white with street names in black lettering.\n\nThey were installed in Tallahassee in 1936. They were replaced by aluminum signs on tall, metal posts in 1979 when national traffic codes required street signs to be reflective and high enough to be viewed easily.\n\nThe concrete markers also caused more damage than metal posts when struck by cars and presented maintenance problems: \"Every two to three years we had to repaint them and re-stencil the street names,\" said Ellis Cheshire, a retired city street markers supervisor.\n\nSome of the concrete markers were re-used by the city as parking lot bumpers and barriers, such as on Martin Street, where 30 of them prevent cars from driving into Lafayette Park. Some were used for erosion control, such as at the Tallahassee Museum. Residents claimed some as mementos and a few, now weathered and illegible, remain on street corners.\n\nPottsdamer was prominent Black landowner, cigar maker\n\nPottsdamer Street, in the Callen neighborhood in southwest Tallahassee, is named for Edward A. Pottsdamer, a prominent Tallahassee Black businessman and land owner in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nPottsdamer was born in Lake City in 1877 and moved to Tallahassee in 1891. He apparently apprenticed at the Wahnish Cigar Factory in the All Saints neighborhood, before starting his own nearby E. A. Pottsdamer Cigar Company. In 1922, he won the blue ribbon at the state fair for making Florida's best cigar.\n\nPottsdamer acquired significant Tallahassee property. In 1929, he deeded property to the Leon County School Board, where a new Lincoln High was built after fire destroyed the original school. In the early 1970s, the city and county purchased land for the Donald L. Tucker Civic Center from Pottsdamer's heirs.\n\nPottsdamer was active in civic affairs: In 1920, he was elected to the board of the state Republican Party; in 1938, he was elected to the executive board of the Leon County Republican Party. He was a Mason, a member of the Knights of Pythias, head of the Black community bond drive during World War II and won a Silver Eagle Award for his work with Boy Scouts.\n\nThough Pottsdamer and his wife, Pinkie, were childless, they raised two nephews. The older boy died in 1920, at age 7, when he was electrocuted by a live electric wire, downed by a storm, at the corner of Madison and Bronough streets. The younger nephew, Vinzant Pottsdamer, was a Marine Corps veteran who taught at Lincoln High (1950-1966) and Atlanta before his death in 1997.\n\nThe Callen neighborhood, between the FSU golf course and Pine View Elementary, was developed in 1953 by then-Tallahassee Police Chief Frank Stoutamire. The three streets are Pottsdamer, Gunn and Callen. Dr. William Gunn was Tallahassee's first Black physician. Maude Callen was Gunn's niece, who was raised by her uncle, graduated from Florida A&M, was a nurse-midwife in South Carolina and became famous in 1951 as the subject of a photo essay in Life magazine.\n\nEdward Pottsdamer died in 1961 and is buried beside his wife, who died in 1957, in the Old City Cemetery. Several home furnishings from Pottsdamer's home are in the FAMU Black Archives.\n\nBel Air: A long-gone hideaway from yellow fever\n\nBel Air was a community established in 1841 about six miles south of Tallahassee because of the yellow fever epidemic that enveloped the city. The open pine woods and breezes were believed to provide a more healthy climate. Bel Air, also spelled Bel Aire and Bellair, remained a resort community for the socially prominent and wealthy until the end of the Civil War.\n\nNo signs remain today of the community, which local historians Joe Knetsch and Claude Kenneson believe was probably located near today's Flea Market on Capital Circle SW, just west of the Woodville Highway.\n\nThe Bel Air Road remained the name for the main highway south from Tallahassee into the 20th century. It ran along the path of Woodville Highway and paralleled the St. Marks Railroad (today's St. Marks bike trail). Local historian Mary Cathrin May believes Bel Air Road originally began at the Tallahassee railroad depot and ran south along today's Wahnish Way to the Woodville Highway.\n\nBy 1885, Adams Street had been extended south to Four Points and the Woodville Highway, and became the northern end of the Bel Air Road.\n\nTwo roads named for developer T.S. Green\n\nGreen Street in Levy Park, as well as T.S. Green Road in Miccosukee, are named for Thomas Sherrill Green, a Tallahassee real estate developer in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nGreen owned land all over Tallahassee and developed several neighborhoods. Starting in 1925, he developed the Sunniland neighborhood (now subsumed into the Levy Park neighborhood), which is bounded by Seventh Avenue, Milton Street, 10th Avenue and M.L. King Boulevard. He named the street between Milton and M.L. King for himself.\n\nGreen was a native of Mt. Gilead, N.C., who lived from 1906 to 1929 in Miccosukee, where he operated a general store and produce warehouse beside the railroad.\n\nIn 1937, he and his wife, Velva, built an impressive, two story brick home at 228 E. Tharpe St., overlooking Lake Ella. The Greens had three sons. Velva Green died in 1971; T.S. Green died in 1974 at age 96.\n\nAll Saints Neighborhood: Holy rolling on Gaines street\n\nThe streets in this neighborhood between Gaines Street and the railroad once all bore names of saints — and there is only speculation about why they were so named.\n\nOne theory holds they were named by Irish laborers who helped build the adjacent railroad in the 1850s and may have settled in the area. Another theory is they were named by George K. Walker, who developed the area in the 1880s.\n\nThree of the saints' names remain: St. Francis, St. Michaels and All Saints streets. But originally, modern-day Duval Street (St. Peter's), Bronough Street (St. James) and Railroad Avenue (St. Patrick's) also bore saints' names for the portions of them between Gaines and the railroad tracks.\n\nThe once-fading neighborhood is experiencing a wave of new buildings and businesses.\n\nWahnish Way: A Jewish pioneer and tobacco tycoon\n\nThe main drag through the Florida A&M University campus, originally called Railroad Avenue, was named in 1966 for Sam Wahnish, a city commissioner (1938-1941) and civic leader.\n\nWahnish was a member of one of Tallahassee's pioneer Jewish families, and his father, Abraham Wahnish, was a prominent tobacco farmer and cigar manufacturer.\n\nSam Wahnish served five years as vice president of Wahnish and Sons Cigar Factory before spending 45 years in the state comptroller's office.\n\nThe two-story cigar factory, built in 1905 is still standing on St. Francis Street, and has been a lighting company and nightclub and was once targeted to be a museum. In 1971, the Railroad Avenue name was restored to a portion of Wahnish Way from Madison Street to FAMU Way.\n\nSam Wahnish died in 1976. The road bearing his name was changed this year to honor FAMU tennis star Althea Gibson. The city is looking for other ways to honor him.\n\nOx Bottom Road: Lost livestock led to name\n\nThis road connects Thomasville Road and Meridian Road, and was built through a one-time rural area of farms and properties originally accessible only from Bannerman Road.\n\nIn 1950, W.J. and Sue Boynton bought a tract of 1,200 acres from Mrs. Alfred B. Maclay.\n\nThe Boyntons were told their property was known locally as \"the ox bottom\" because of a low-lying field (between the present-day Ox Bow Circle and Evening Star Lane) where lost oxen were often found back when fields were plowed by oxen. The bottom was filled with maiden cane, a nutritious native plant that oxen loved to eat.\n\nThe Boyntons, who raised cattle, called their property Ox Bottom Ranch. In 1967, the Boyntons and other property owners deeded land for the road to Leon County, which named it Ox Bottom Road.\n\nFlagg Street honors jeweler, one-term mayor\n\nFlagg Street, off the Woodville Highway, is named for Francis Hopkins Flagg, the founder of the summer community of Bel Air. The community, on the east side of Woodville Highway, just north of Capital Circle Southeast, was located in the area of Flagg Street. Bel Air was a retreat for well-to-do Tallahassee families in the mid-19th century.\n\nFlagg was a jeweler from Massachusetts who came to Tallahassee in 1838 and opened a watch shop on Monroe Street. In 1847, Flagg won $2,000 in the Louisiana lottery. With his winnings, he bought a home at 323 E. Park Ave., from R.A. Shine, one of the city's leading early builders.\n\nIn 1848, Flagg was elected to a one-year term as mayor; he was later a member of the city council (1865-1870) and secretary-treasurer of the local railroad. Flagg died in 1872 and the home was sold.\n\nBut in 1894, the home was bought by Simeon Chittenden for his son, after his marriage to Francis Flagg's granddaughter — bringing the home full circle. The Chittenden family still owned the home, which has been restored, on the southeast corner of Park Avenue and Gadsden Street.\n\nLonnbladh Road gets name from Los Robles developer\n\nLonnbladh Road in northeast Tallahassee is named for Leon Lonnbladh, the co-developer of the Los Robles subdivision at Thomasville and Meridian Roads. Lonnbladh was born in 1877 in Sweden.\n\nA civil engineer, he moved to the United States in 1901 and worked for several railroad companies. He came to Tallahassee in 1924 to survey a new railroad to Tampa. When that project failed, Lonnbladh remained in Tallahassee and became a land developer.\n\nLonnbladh and Albert Thornton developed the Mediterranean-themed Los Robles (\"The Oaks\") in 1926, just before the collapse of the Florida land boom. Only eight buildings were constructed in Los Robles before 1930 and only four structures were built in the Mediterranean style, including the still extant entrance gate and the Tallahassee Woman's Club.\n\nLonnbladh also owned land near Welaunee Plantation — where the road named for him was deeded to the county in 1938. Lonnbladh died in 1952 in his Los Robles home at 246 DeSoto St.\n\nMacomb Street: Former judge opened first Capitol, launched Fourth of July party\n\nThis one-time main drag of the Black Frenchtown community is named for David Macomb, one of Tallahassee's early prominent white residents.\n\nA native of Michigan, Macomb came to Tallahassee at its founding in 1824. He organized the city's first Fourth of July celebration in 1826 and that same year delivered the main speech at the completion of the first Capitol building.\n\nHe was one of the founders of St.John's Episcopal Church in 1829 and one of Leon County's first county judges.\n\nHe infamously fought a Tallahassee duel against Prince Achille Murat, in which he shot off half of the prince's little finger. Macomb died in 1837.\n\nHis son, David Jr., was a U.S. Navy admiral for whom a World War II ship was named.\n\nCampbell Park named for prominent Black physician\n\nCampbell Pond Park, at the end of Shoreline Drive off the Woodville Highway, is named for Alpha Omega Campbell, a prominent Black physician in 20th century Tallahassee.\n\nCampbell was a Gadsden County native, who treated white and Black people and operated a private hospital for African Americans on W. Virginia Street (near its intersection with M.L. King Boulevard). Campbell's prosperity allowed him to acquire a large swath of land near the present-day park.\n\nThe southside streets of Alpha, Omega, Zillah and Gaile are named for the doctor, a daughter and a granddaughter — and numerous babies he delivered in Tallahassee were named for him.\n\nIn 1955, Campbell was indicted in the death of a white woman who had an illegal abortion. Though Campbell insisted the woman came to him only for treatment after her abortion was botched by a white doctor, he was convicted of manslaughter, sent to prison for four years and had his medical license revoked. After prison, his efforts to have his medical license re-instated were unsuccessful.\n\nCampbell died in 1971. The city purchased the land for the park in 1981.\n\nPalmer Munroe Teen Center named for late city official\n\nThe Palmer Munroe Teen Center on Jackson Bluff Road is named for the late assistant city manager, Palmer \"Doc\" Munroe. A native of Tallahassee, nicknamed for a local physician named Palmer, Munroe was the brother of Ivan Munroe, one of the city's early aviators for whom the Tallahassee Regional Airport terminal is named.\n\nPalmer Munroe began his career with the city in 1928, rising from meter reader to city cashier to assistant city manager under City Manager Arvah Hopkins. As assistant city manager for 10 years, Munroe was famous for his round-the-clock availability to citizens, especially those in underprivileged neighborhoods. Munroe died in September 1963 at age 55 of complications from diabetes. Construction had just begun on the Westside Community Center, which was renamed in his honor when it opened in February 1964.\n\nThe community center closed in 2009 because of city budget cuts, then reopened in 2010 as Tallahassee's first teen center, funded by the state and county. \"My dad would be so happy that his namesake is being used in the way it's being used,\" said Munroe's daughter Anne Williamson-Vinson.\n\nLipona: A made-up name for Murat's plantation\n\nThis is one of four westside streets near Florida State University named in honor of Prince Achille Murat and Princess Catherine Murat.\n\nThe nephew of Napoleon lived for 22 years on a plantation in Jefferson County that he named Lipona. After his death, his widow lived in a westside Tallahassee home she called Belle Vue (\"beautiful view\").\n\nThe names of three of the streets are self-explanatory: Prince, Murat and Belle Vue.\n\nBut Lipona is a made-up name.\n\nMurat was the Prince of Naples (Italy), which is spelled \"Napoli\" in Italian. The prince simply created an anagram of Napoli for the name of his American plantation: Lipona.\n\nNugent Drive named for wife of FSU football coach\n\nTwo eastside residential streets, Margaret Court and Nugent Drive, are named for the wife of Florida State football coach Tom Nugent — who coached FSU in its first game against the University of Florida.\n\nThe Nugents had nine children: When Peg Nugent gave birth to her last child in 1958, developer Syde Deeb named two streets behind the old Tallahassee Democrat building in her honor.\n\nTom Nugent was famed as a coaching innovator during stops at Virginia Military Institute, FSU and Maryland, as he created the I-formation and other offensive concepts still used today.\n\nNugent, whose FSU players included Lee Corso and Burt Reynolds, was coach and athletic director for FSU from 1953-1958. The charismatic Nugent led the still-young program to marquee victories over Tennessee and Miami and was a leading advocate for an annual game against Florida. The first meeting was Nov. 22, 1958. Though FSU scored a touchdown on its opening drive, Florida won 21-7.\n\nThe Nugents, married 61 years, spent their final years in Tallahassee. Peg died in 2002; Tom died in 2006.\n\nWaldo Palmer Lane named for late local veterinarian\n\nWaldo Palmer Lane, off Mahan Drive near the Florida Sheriffs Association, is named for the late Tallahassee veterinarian Waldo Palmer.\n\nA native of Camilla, Ga., Palmer earned two degrees at the University of Georgia. He worked as a veterinarian at a Miami horse racing track before moving to Tallahassee in 1952.\n\nHe and veterinarian Paul Vickers operated an animal clinic on South Monroe Street, until Palmer opened Palmer Animal Hospital in an old home on six acres off Mahan Drive in 1961. Palmer operated the clinic until his death of cancer at age 52 in 1979.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, his widow, Sharon Palmer (sister-in-law of Tallahassee entrepreneur DeVoe Moore), and their four children developed the property, naming the entrance road for their husband/father. The property includes the defunct Atlantis restaurant, a prosthetics company, two office buildings — and an animal hospital that operated in Palmer's original building.\n\nEarly Spanish explorers dubbed island Saint George\n\nThe barrier island 80 miles southwest of Tallahassee known as Saint George has been drawing beachgoers since long before there was a Fourth of July holiday. It was named San George by early Spanish explorers, with the expedition of Panfilo Narvaez probably the first Europeans to set foot on the island.\n\nThe island was 28 miles long until 1957, when it was divided by the dredging of the Bob Sikes Cut to allow quicker passage of ships from Apalachicola to open ocean. The resulting 9-mile western Little St. George is uninhabited; the 19-mile eastern Big St. George is a vacation retreat that includes a 9-mile-long state park.\n\nThe island was reachable only by boat until 1965, when a toll bridge-and-causeway was built from Eastpoint (the $2 toll was dropped in 1992 after the bridge was paid off). In 2004, the bridge-and-causeway were replaced by a 4.1 mile bridge. In 2008, the historic lighthouse on Little St. George was dismantled and rebuilt in the center of the main St. George Island.\n\nBrevard: The last Confederate general who got a street, county name\n\nBrevard Street, the long east-west street that runs past the Governor's Mansion and The Grove, is named for one of Tallahassee's most distinguished 19th-century families.\n\nTheodore Washington Brevard, a North Carolina native, came to Florida in 1847 and was state comptroller from 1853-1861. Brevard County in Central Florida is named for him.\n\nHis son, Theodore Washington Brevard Jr., was a Tallahassee attorney, state legislator and state inspector general. He was the last Confederate officer promoted to general during the Civil War, and was captured by Union Gen. George Armstrong Custer in the waning days of the war.\n\nBrevard Jr., who died in 1882, was married to the daughter of Florida territorial governor Richard Keith Call, who built The Grove. Brevard Jr. was the father of Caroline Brevard, for whom a Tallahassee elementary school is named.\n\nFlastacowo Road: A phonetic abbreviation for FSU lakefront\n\nModern generations of FSU students must assume that it's some kind of Native American name that identifies the road off Lake Bradford Road that leads to the Seminole Reservation.\n\nBut Flastacowo Road is actually a phonetic abbreviation for Florida State College for Women, which was what Florida State University was called from 1909 to 1947, before it became a co-ed school.\n\nIt was a popular name at FSCW, which used it for the Seminole Reservation, the yearbook and the numerous alumni clubs started by female grads before the switch to a co-ed university.\n\nSealey Elementary was named after a Leon principal\n\nThe Sealey Elementary Math and Science Magnet School, on Allen Road near the Tallahassee Mall, was originally at 234 E. Seventh Ave. — now the home of the Tallahassee Police Department. The school opened in 1930 as Sealey Memorial Elementary and commemorated Romero Mitchell Sealey.\n\nSealey had been a school principal in Fort Myers before coming to Tallahassee, where he was a Leon High principal, state schools inspector and secretary of the Florida Education Association.\n\nSealey, 39, died from a stroke in 1928 while traveling by train to a national education conference in Boston. Sealey was succeeded as FEA Secretary by James S. Rickards (for whom a Tallahassee high school was later named).\n\nSealey Memorial ceased operations at its original location after the 1969-1970 school year and opened at its current site in fall 1970. The Seventh Avenue building was remodeled and opened as TPD headquarters in 1972.\n\nWhat's in a name?The historic figures and educators behind Leon County school names\n\nDorman Hall honors popular professor, dean\n\nDorman Hall at Florida State University was named for a popular professor and dean in the final years of FSU's existence as a woman's college.\n\nOlivia Dorman came to Florida State College for Women as a classics professor in 1924. A native of Alabama, she earned her undergraduate degree at Randolph Macon Woman's College, then earned her master's and Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. She soon became chair of the department.\n\nIn 1925, the hugely popular Sarah Landrum Cawthon, FSCW's first Dean of the College Home, resigned because of poor health. Her two immediate successors proved wildly unpopular as they ended numerous FSCW rituals and traditions. In 1934, Dorman was appointed to the position renamed Dean of Students.\n\nDorman oversaw a great modernization of FSCW social rules, while supporting many traditions. Under Dorman, rules on smoking, riding in cars and dating were relaxed. The housing program was reorganized, a counseling program begun and the synchronized swimming Tarpon Club was founded.\n\nBut with the arrival of male students in 1946, Dorman was unable to enforce many of FSCW's longstanding policies. In 1947, a month after FSCW officially became the co-ed Florida State University, she resigned to return as head of the classics department. She retired in 1949 and died in Tallahassee in 1958 at age 66.\n\nIn 1959, the newly constructed Dorman Hall on West Jefferson Street was named for her. After a new Dorman Hall complex opened nearby in 2015, the old Dorman Hall was demolished.\n\nFAMU library named for postman alumnus\n\nFlorida A&M University's Coleman Library is named for a former president of the FAMU alumni association — and Tallahassee postman who was killed in a car accident shortly before the library opened in 1949.\n\nSamuel Harrison Coleman graduated from FAMU in 1906. He was a longtime member of the FAMU alumni association, serving many years as president of the organization. He also spent 40 years as a Tallahassee mail carrier.\n\nOn Feb. 9, 1948, Coleman was crossing the 400 block of West Brevard Street at night, when he was struck by a car driven by a Florida State University student, John H. Leonard. Coleman suffered a concussion, broken leg and other injuries and died nine days later. He was 63.\n\nLeonard, from Milton, had been a B-24 pilot in World War II and was driving a car he borrowed from his aunt. Leonard, driving west on Brevard Street, said he was blinded by the lights of an eastbound car that pulled out from curb and said he didn't see Coleman until he was just 20 feet from the man. State attorney William Hopkins declined to press charges.\n\nA month later, FAMU President William Gray announced the school's under-construction library would be named for Coleman. The $425,000 library opened Jan. 16, 1949. It was the first building on the FAMU campus to bear the name of an alumnus.\n\nTucker Hall named for FAMU's first president\n\nTucker Hall, the former home of Florida A&M's College of Journalism and Graphic Arts, is named for the university's first president.\n\nThomas DeSaille Tucker was born in 1844 in Sierra Leone; his mother was the daughter of an African chief and his father was an Englishman. At 12, Tucker was brought to the United States by a Methodist missionary. He earned a degree from Oberlin College in 1865 and taught school in Kentucky and Louisiana, before opening a law practice in 1882 in Pensacola.\n\nIn 1887, he accepted the post as president of the new Florida State Normal College for Colored Students. The school opened with 15 students in a single building on the site of today's Florida State University. Tucker and former Florida legislator Thomas Gibbs were the only instructors, charged with training Black school teachers. Under Tucker, the school grew to more than 200 students and eight buildings on its current site south of downtown.\n\nTucker resigned in 1901 following disputes over the direction of the school and his ill health. He practiced law in Baltimore before dying in 1903. Tucker Hall housed FAMU's journalism school from 1977 to 2005, when the college moved into an adjacent new building. Tucker Hall is now home to the College of Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities and the Charles Winterwood Theater.\n\nEfferson Street honors FAMU dean\n\nEfferson Street, a one-block long residential street off Gibbs Drive, is named for H. Manning Efferson, a one-time dean and interim president at Florida A&M University.\n\nEfferson was a native of South Carolina who earned a master's degree from Columbia and came to FAMU as a math instructor in 1924. Efferson went on to serve as head of the math department, dean of liberal arts and dean of students before being tapped as interim president from July 1949 to April 1950, between the presidencies of William Gray and George Gore.\n\nDuring his presidency, Efferson oversaw numerous construction projects, including completion of the former FAMU Hospital. In 1950, Gore appointed Efferson the first FAMU Dean of Administration. In 1954, the Pine Lumber construction company developed the Gore subdivision off Gibbs Drive just south of Tharpe Street. The company named the subdivision for the FAMU president, Gore, and its main street for Efferson. Efferson retired from FAMU in the early 1960s and died in 1972; FAMU named its student union building for him in 1975.\n\nEfferson's daughter, Victoria Efferson Warner, was a prominent Tallahassee social worker, community activist and FAMU professor who founded the university's School of Social Work. Warner died in 2006.\n\nSellers Street honors dairy farmer\n\nSellers Street, a short, dead-end street off Pontiac Drive, is named for the late Calvin Collis \"C.C.\" Sellers, a longtime Tallahassee dairy farmer.\n\nSellers operated a dairy farm from 1944 to 1954 that stretched from Paul Russell Road to Orange Avenue and included today's Leon County Fairgrounds. He and his wife, Mary, lived in a farmhouse that still stands at 1012 Paul Russell Road. In 1954, Sellers sold his land to Tallahassee developer Syde Deeb, who built the adjacent Apalachee Ridge Estates and paved a short street behind the farmhouse, which he named in Sellers' honor.\n\nSellers then moved his dairy farm to a 700-acre farm near Lake Jackson, operating it until the early 1980s. That farm, stretching from Old Bainbridge Road to North Monroe Street, encompassed today's Edinburgh Estates, View Pointe subdivision and Canopy Oaks Elementary School — and Sellers' two-story brick home was surrounded by the under-construction Arbor Landing apartment complex and set for demolition.\n\nSellers died in 1983; his wife of 47 years, Mary, is 97.\n\nWade Wehunt was city's director of pools\n\nWade Wehunt Pool in Myers Park is named for Wade Harrison Wehunt, the first director of city pools.\n\nWehunt, a native of Tate, Ga., came to Tallahassee in 1923. He was a real estate developer, who in 1929 built one of the early homes in Myers Park neighborhood (527 Oakland St.). He was hired in 1952 to oversee construction of the city's first three municipal pools, two for whites and one for Black residents.\n\nAfter completion of the pools at Myers Park, Levy Park and Griffin Heights in 1953, Wehunt was named director of city pools. Wehunt initiated the first swimming lessons and first water safety classes and spent 20 years as director of the local Red Cross. He served as a city elections inspector in the 1930s and 1940s and spent more than 20 years as manager of the Elks Club (then on North Monroe Street where the Tennyson condominiums are today), where he was active in downtown affairs.\n\nThe Myers Park pool was named for Wehunt upon his retirement in 1968. He died in 1985.\n\nGallows Hill: Where FSU presidents reign from Westcott\n\nFlorida State University's Westcott Hall Administration Building, at College Avenue and Copeland Street, is built on a site once known as Gallows Hill.\n\nThe name stems from the fall of 1829 or 1830, following what is believed to be Tallahassee's second murder, when an unidentified Black woman was convicted of killing her baby and sentenced to die. The hill where Westcott is located was chosen as the site for the gallows and the woman was hanged there.\n\nThe site was used for subsequent executions until 1854, when Tallahassee mayor Francis Eppes built a male academy on the site as an inducement to legislators.\n\nIn 1851, the legislature had established two seminaries in Florida, on the east and west sides of the Suwannee River. Several cities vied to be homes to the seminaries: In 1857, FSU won out over Marianna and Quincy and opened its doors as West Florida Seminary — in the building on Gallows Hill — becoming the forerunner of today's Florida State University.\n\nCity's 'seven hills' just a legend\n\nIt is a local legend that Tallahassee was built on seven hills. That's why Seven Hills is a common Tallahassee descriptive name: Six current local businesses have Seven Hills in their name.\n\nBut it's a fiction: Tallahassee has far more than seven hills and none of them were ever identified as key to the city's location.\n\nSome modern-day observers say \"Seven Hills\" was a conceit several hilly American cities adopted in tribute to Rome, which famously was founded on seven hills. Territorial Gov. William DuVal even named his Myers Park estate \"Mount Aventine,\" after one of those Roman hills.\n\nIn 1997, Tallahassee Democrat reporter Jan Pudlow talked to city officials to identify the seven tallest hills in city limits: Goodwood Plantation (216 feet), Old Fort Park (212), Mission San Luis (208 feet), Old Capitol (207 feet), The Grove (204 feet), FAMU's Lee Hall (192 feet) and FSU's Westcott Hall (176 feet).\n\nEd Young, research supervisor for the Tallahassee-Leon County Planning Department, confirmed those remain the seven highest points in city limits — but noted there are numerous areas in northern Leon County with elevations as high as 248 feet. The National Weather Service lists Tallahassee's average elevation as 197 feet.\n\nOrr Drive named for FAMU professor killed in WWII\n\nOrr Drive, on the campus of Florida A&M University, is named for Herbert Roy Orr, a professor who died in World War II. The street runs south off Robert and Trudie Perkins Way, between the School of Journalism and Graphic Communications and Tucker Hall.\n\nOrr was born in 1909 in Washington, D.C. He earned a bachelor's and master's degree from Howard University, where he participated in ROTC. He was hired at FAMU in 1936 and taught mechanical drawing and radio communications.\n\nHe joined the Army in 1943, became a captain in the U.S. Signal Corps and fought at Guadalcanal. He died in April 1944 at age 35 and is buried in a national memorial cemetery in Hawaii.\n\nIn 1938, he married fellow FAMU instructor, Ruth Bates. Ruth Bates Orr, who never remarried after her husband's death, taught 18 years at FAMU Developmental Research School and then many years in the Leon County school system. She died in 1989.\n\nRuth Bates Orr's niece is Carriemae Marquess, a retired FAMU food and nutrition professor (1946-1989), who was selected one of the top 100 FAMUANs of the 20th century. Marquess continues to live in the home near the FAMU campus that her aunt built shortly after World War II.\n\nCalhoun Street honors senator and two-time vice president\n\nCalhoun Street is named for John C. Calhoun, the 19th century statesman who played a role in Florida becoming part of the United States. Calhoun was a U.S. Senator from South Carolina and served as U.S. Vice President under two presidents, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.\n\nIn 1818, while Secretary of War for President James Monroe, Calhoun approved Jackson's invasion of Florida because of threats posed by Native Americans and runaway slaves. Jackson's incursion became the First Seminole War, and led to Spain selling Florida to the United States — though Calhoun later criticized Jackson for over-stepping his authority. Calhoun began his political career as a pro-Union supporter, but became famed for his defense of states rights, nullification and slavery as a \"positive good.\"\n\nNorth Calhoun Street has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1979 for its 16 historic buildings. Calhoun Street was once mostly residential and lined with stately oak trees. The cutting of several oaks on Calhoun Street in 1940 led to public protest and the \"Live Oak Trail,\" a driving tour of Tallahassee trees. In 1955, Calhoun (southbound) and Gadsden Street (northbound) became Tallahassee's first paired, one-way streets.\n\nMcLean Park named for former city commissioner\n\nJack McLean Jr. Park is named for a former Tallahassee City Commissioner who was instrumental in the city's purchase of the property in 1985. McLean was a city commissioner from 1984 to 1992.\n\nMcLean later became city attorney for Quincy and since 2008 has been Quincy City Manager. A native of North Carolina, who earned his law degree at FSU, McLean spent 17 years (1977-1994) as head of Legal Services of North Florida before beginning his political career.\n\nMcLean Park is set on a wooded, 52-acre tract along Paul Russell Road that was once the site of the John Barry Dairy. The dairy was purchased in the 1950s by developer Syde Deeb, who built the nearby Apalachee Ridge subdivision. Deeb gave the unused portion of the former dairy to the FSU Foundation, which sold the 52 acres to the city in 1985 for $425,000.\n\nSouthside Park opened in 1992, with hiking trails, ball fields and basketball courts. In 2004, a community center and two pools were added. The city commission renamed the park for McLean in 1998.\n\nGore led tumultuous era at FAMU\n\nThe Gore Education Complex at Florida A&M University, as well as nearby residential street, Gore Avenue, is named for former FAMU president George W. Gore.\n\nGeorge William Gore Jr., was FAMU president from 1950 to 1968, making him the second-longest serving FAMU president to J.R.E. Lee (1924-1944).\n\nGore, a native of Nashville, earned his bachelor's degree in English and journalism from DePauw, his master's from Harvard and his Ph.D. from Columbia. He joined the faculty of Tennessee A&I (today's Tennessee State University), where he became a pioneer Black journalism instructor, and spent 23 years as dean before he was hired at FAMU.\n\nGore directed a period of great growth at FAMU. More than 20 new buildings were constructed, including the FAMU Hospital (1950) and FAMU Developmental Research School (1957). Gore created FAMU's first university police force (1952), presided over the transition from Florida A&M College (FAMCEE, as it was called) to Florida A&M University (1953) and enrolled the first white student (James Van Matre, 1964).\n\nBut Gore's tenure is most remembered for the rise of student demonstrations. From the bus boycott (1956) to lunch counter sit-ins (1960) to theater protests (1963), FAMU students took a lead role in the Tallahassee civil rights movement. Under pressure from white officials, Gore discouraged political dissent by FAMU students and faculty but did not forbid it.\n\n\"He was not weak but cautious,\" said FAMU historian Leedell Neyland. \"Gore's strength was that while he was not active in civil rights leadership, he did not prevent his faculty and students from participating.\"\n\nAfter FAMU, Gore returned to Nashville, where he died in1982 at age 81.\n\nDoug Burnette Park\n\nThe little park on Gaines Street at Martin Luther King Boulevard used to be one of the city's most popular children's playgrounds.\n\nBuilt in 1938 by the Depression-era Works Progress Administration, the park was named for Doug Burnette, executive director of the regional Boy Scouts office and chairman of Tallahassee's first recreation board.\n\nThe park included a softball diamond, a basketball court, swings, seesaws and a tether-ball pole.\n\nThe playground equipment was removed in the 1980s. In 2008, the park was renovated with landscaping, benches and other improvements, including \"Quark,\" an 80-foot-tall, blue-painted steel piece by John Henry, a nationally renowned sculptor. The sculpture was later moved to the Orlando Museum of Art.\n\nDRS first named for Black educator\n\nFlorida A&M's Developmental Research School was once called Lucy Moten School, in honor of one of the leading Black educators of the early 20th century.\n\nLucy Moten was born in 1851 to a free Black couple in Washington, D.C. Educated in Massachusetts and Howard University, she was director for 37 years (1883-1920) of the Miner Normal School, a public teacher training institution for Black students in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe became nationally famous for her discipline and high educational standards, drawing Black prospective teachers from all over the nation. Moten, who never married, was killed after being struck by a taxi in New York's Times Square in 1933.\n\nFAMU president J.R.E. Lee, an associate of Moten, named FAMU's teacher-training school for Moten in 1932. In 1935, a new Lucy Moten School was constructed at then Gamble Street and M.L. King Boulevard. Lucy Moten School originally served grades one through eight (then the highest grade offered to Black students), then was used for elementary classes when the school expanded to grades K-12 and was called FAMU High.\n\nIn 2009, FAMU High moved to a new complex at Wahnish Way and Orange Avenue and assumed the name FAMU DRS — though the historic Lucy Moten School building is still used for university office space.\n\nWeems Road named for former cattle rancher\n\nWeems Road, a one-time rural road that connects Mahan Drive to Tom Brown Park, is named for George Emerson Weems, a former state official who had a cattle farm in the area.\n\nA native of Hillsboro, Tenn., and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, Weems moved to South Florida in 1914. He came to Tallahassee in 1933 as director of the newly created Milk Control Board, which regulated the state dairy industry (and was disbanded in 1969).\n\nFrom 1935 to 1937, he served as the second director of the state Beverage Commission, established to regulate the sale of alcohol after the end of Prohibition (now part of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation). After he left state government, Weems operated a cattle ranch and livestock market on Lake Lafayette.\n\nWeems died in 1958; his wife, Sally Hieronymous Weems, died in 1983 — the year Weems Road was annexed into the city.\n\nMuseum, school named for revered John Gilmore Riley\n\nThe school off Tharpe Street and the downtown museum are named for John Gilmore Riley, Tallahassee's most prominent early Black educator, community leader and businessman. Called Northwest Elementary when it opened in 1951, it was renamed for Riley a year after his death in 1954.\n\nRiley was born into slavery in 1857 and worked odd jobs until landing his first teaching position in 1877. A self-taught educator, he taught in Wakulla, Gadsden and Leon counties before spending 33 years (1893-1926) as principal of Tallahassee's all-Black Lincoln High.\n\nDespite never earning more than $100 a month as principal, Riley became one of Tallahassee's leading property owners and was revered for his leadership in the Black community.\n\nThe home he built in 1890 at 419 E. Jefferson is on the National Register of Historic Places and since 1997 has been the John G. Riley Center/African American Museum of History and Culture. (Feb. 6, 2012)\n\nGoodbody Lane has a Thomas Jefferson connection\n\nGoodbody Lane, a three-block connector street off East Park Avenue that borders the Florida Lottery, is named for Albert and Fannie Goodbody who once lived at the corner of Park Avenue and the dirt trail that became Goodbody Lane.\n\nAlbert George Goodbody was an English native, who served as a Tallahassee justice of the peace until his death in 1936. His wife, Fannie Maude Craig, was the great-great-granddaughter of U.S. President Thomas Jefferson and the granddaughter of Francis Eppes. Eppes was one of Tallahassee's early settlers, a longtime mayor and a founder of what became Florida State University.\n\nAs Frenchtown fades, mystery over name continues\n\nFrenchtown is the name for the former commercial and residential heart of Tallahassee's Black community.\n\nIt was bounded roughly by Brevard, Duval, Call and Dewey streets, around the axis of Macomb Street's stores, restaurants and nightclubs.\n\nLore long held it was named for French farmers sent to Tallahassee by the Marquis de Lafayette in 1831.\n\nSubsequent research revealed the farmers never actually came to Tallahassee. Frenchtown could have been named for Jourdan Frenchy, a mulatto carpenter who built many early houses there, or Frenchtown, N.J., site of an infamous War of 1812 massacre and stronghold of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, whose preachers often visited Tallahassee.\n\nAll but a handful of businesses have left Frenchtown, which is home to many new houses and apartments, plus the city's Renaissance Center.\n\nFading Frenchtown:Frenchtown fights to survive, preserve history as it's squeezed by student housing\n\nKillearn Estates: Where Scottish and Irish eyes smile on Tallahassee\n\nMost streets in Tallahassee's ground-breaking subdivision bear Irish names — even though Killearn is a village in Scotland. That dichotomy caused an early flap with the family who brought the name to Tallahassee.\n\nNew York financier Alfred Barmore Maclay bought a Leon County hunting plantation in 1923. Maclay planted thousands of plants on the plantation and renamed it Killearn Gardens in honor of his ancestral home in Scotland.\n\nIn 1953, his widow, Louise, donated the gardens to the state.\n\nIn 1964, Tallahassee native J.T. Williams began developing Killearn Estates — directly across Thomasville Road from Killearn Gardens State Park — and giving his streets Irish names.\n\nLouise Maclay was incensed and protested the Irish names. Ultimately, the gardens were renamed Maclay Gardens.\n\nWilliams, who went on to develop Killearn Acres, Killearn Lakes, Golden Eagle and five Georgia subdivisions, laughs: \"We always said we don't care if (the street names) are Irish or Scottish, if the check is made out correctly.\"\n\nHays Street: A name intertwined with history\n\nThis residential street that straddles Magnolia Drive from Belmont Drive to Oak Street, is named for Jesse Hays, who built the home on nearby Park Avenue that now houses the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\nHays came to Tallahassee at the turn of the 20th century to serve as manager of Tallahassee's first phone company; he was later a state inspector on engineering projects in the Everglades. In 1910, he and his wife, Sarah, built the Queen Anne style house at 906 E. Park Ave. Jesse Hays, who died in 1950, was an avid photographer and many of his photos of early Park Avenue are in the Florida Photographic Collection.\n\nIn 1949, son Harold Hays sold the home to Tallahassee insurance agent Buck Hood and his wife, Rebecca, who raised four children and lived in the home for nearly 60 years. Buck Hood died in 2002. Rebecca Hood sold the house to the historic trust in 2005 and died in 2009.\n\nSaxon Street named for Capital City Bank founder\n\nThis long residential street through a traditionally Black community adjoining Florida A&M University is named for one of Tallahassee's most prominent early white businessmen, George Washington Saxon.\n\nA native of Tallahassee whose education ended in grade school, Saxon began his business career as owner of a general store.\n\nIn 1889, he began a private bank in his store, and six years later (1895) he founded Capital City Bank, Tallahassee's oldest, continuously operating business.\n\nSaxon was a prosperous real estate developer throughout Tallahassee (he donated the land for the Florida Governor's Mansion) and the Big Bend. He was among the early developers of St. Teresa, Lanark Village and St. George Island, which he owned from 1910 to 1921.\n\nSaxon, who co-founded the first Tallahassee phone company in 1895, died in 1935. His numerous descendants include Tallahassee attorneys Duby Ausley and Palmer Proctor.\n\nEasterwood served on city and county commissions simultaneously\n\nEasterwood Drive, leading into Tom Brown Park, is named for Henry Grady Easterwood — the only person to serve on the Tallahassee City Commission and Leon County Commission at the same time. The choice is fitting: Tom Brown Park is owned by the county but operated by the city.\n\nEasterwood, born in 1900 in Alabama, moved to Tallahassee in 1930. He worked 16 years for the Seaboard Rail Line then became co-owner of a furniture store. He was elected to a five-year term on the city commission in 1950, when the city commission expanded from three members to five members.\n\nIn 1951, Easterwood was one of three city commissioners who tried unsuccessfully to sell the city-owned electric company to a private company; the trio also fired city manager Malcolm Yancey, replacing him with Arvah Hopkins.\n\nIn 1954, Easterwood was mayor when he won election to the county commission. Easterwood's term on the city commission ended a month after he took office on the county commission, allowing him to serve on both commissions. Don Price (city commission, 1974-75; county commission, 1986-1992) is the only other person to serve on both commissions.\n\nEasterwood served 11 years on the county commission, gaining attention for opposing the city's 1956 sale of Capital City Country Club to a private club to avoid racial integration. Easterwood died in office in 1966.\n\nOpperman named for first College of Music dean, who inadvertently helped start the Marching Chiefs\n\nFlorida State University's 442-seat recital hall, Opperman Music Hall, in the Kuersteiner Building, is named for Ella Scoble Opperman, who created the modern day College of Music.\n\nOpperman, born in 1873, was an accomplished pianist and organist, who earned degrees from Wesleyan College in Cincinnati and the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music. She spent three years abroad studying piano in Berlin and Paris before returning to teach music for many years at her alma mater.\n\nShe was hired as Director of Music at Florida State College for Women in 1911, and led the department from a program that conferred teaching certificates to a full degree granting program. In 1920, she was named the first dean of the College of Music and was considered one of the nation's leading music educators, before her retirement in 1944.\n\nOpperman opposed the first efforts to form the College of Music's now-signature marching band. In 1938, 39 female students formed the Tally Troopers to march at student events. Opperman insisted they disband because she said marching was not ladylike.\n\nTwo years later, students resurrected the group, adding musical instruments. Though Opperman and the College of Music did not recognize them officially, the group played at school functions.\n\nIn 1946, after she retired, marching band became a credited class in the College of Music. In 1950, after the school became co-ed, the band was named the Marching Chiefs.\n\nOpperman died at 95 on March 4, 1969 — the day of the infamous Night of the Bayonets, when armed Leon County sheriff's deputies lined Tennessee Street during a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) protest at the FSU Student Union.\n\nAdams Street named for John Quincy Adams almost was Palm Avenue\n\nOne of Tallahassee's oldest and main streets is named for the sixth U.S. President, John Quincy Adams.\n\nAdams was President James Monroe's Secretary of State when Tallahassee was founded in 1824 and the city's two main thoroughfares were named for them. As Secretary of State, Adams negotiated the purchase of Florida from Spain in 1819.\n\nAdams succeeded Monroe as president in 1825, when he became the only U.S. President elected by the House of Representatives because none of the candidates won a majority of electoral votes. Adams was defeated for a second term.\n\nAdams Street was once lined with businesses and homes, as the street ran south from the Governor's Mansion, past the Capitol and south to the coast. All four Tallahassee City Hall buildings have been on Adams Street. The original police and fire stations and Tallahassee Democrat were on Adams.\n\nIn 1921, at the urging of Tallahassee Democrat editor Milton Smith, the city commission approved planting palm trees on Adams Street from the Capitol to the Governor's Mansion – and renaming the street Palm Avenue. Smith promoted the plan as Tallahassee's version of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. Although numerous palm trees were planted, city commissioners abandoned the plan to rename the street in 1922, citing a desire to continue honoring John Quincy Adams.\n\nSince 1927, Adams Street has served as the east-west dividing line for all addresses in Tallahassee.\n\nIn September 1972, Adams Street was permanently closed at Pensacola Street, as the new capitol was built on what had been Adams Street, ending its days as a main thoroughfare.\n\nRuby Diamond Auditorium named for FSU benefactor\n\nRuby Pearl Diamond was a Tallahassee native, who graduated from the newly created Florida State College for Women in 1905 — one of 13 graduates who made up the last co-ed class of the university until 1947.\n\nShe lived for 50 years in the Floridan Hotel on the corner of Call and Monroe streets (now the site of the Aloft Hotel). A longtime benefactor of FSU, she donated $100,000 in land to FSU in 1970, which named its auditorium in Westcott Hall for her — which was fitting as it was Diamond who, in 1936, suggested naming the school's administration building for Tallahassee native James Westcott.\n\nThe auditorium, originally built in 1911 and rebuilt in 1954, was closed for renovations in 2008. It reopened with a concert by blues great B.B. King.\n\nRuby Diamond died in 1982 at age 95.\n\nBull Headley Road named for pioneer of Killearn Lakes\n\nBull Headley Road, off Bannerman Road in northern Leon County, is named for Julien Christian \"Bull\" Headley, who once owned the 4,000-acre plantation that became the Killearn Lakes and Golden Eagle subdivisions.\n\nHeadley, born in Mississippi and raised in Kentucky, came to Tallahassee in 1946 to raise cattle and timber. In 1951, he bought Water Oak Plantation on the south shore of Lake Iamonia, renamed it Bull Run Plantation and built a home.\n\nIn 1952, Headley deeded a dirt road along the boundary of his property from Bannerman Road to Lake Iamonia to Leon County. The county named the road Bull Headley Road, though it was not paved until 1982.\n\nThough generations of Tallahasseeans have pronounced the road as Bull HED-ley Road, the family pronounces its last name HEED-ley. Headley had five children with two wives; two of his daughters, Jill Poole and Kirk Headley-Perdue, still live in Tallahassee.\n\nIn 1964, Headley sold Bull Run to a group of Louisiana investors, who renamed it Kinhega Lodge and turned into a hunting preserve. In 1985, the investors sold the plantation to Killearn Estates developer J.T. Williams, who developed Killearn Lakes.\n\nKinhega, the name of a Miccosukee chief, is still used for the home that Headley built and for one of the two main roads in Killearn Lakes.\n\nIn 1959, Headley bought property in British Honduras, now Belize, where he raised cattle and timber on 18,000 acres. In 1962, he moved to Bermuda and split his time between Belize and Bermuda; Headley gave up his U.S. citizenship in 1972.\n\nAn inveterate entrepreneur who dabbled in many enterprises, Headley converted part of his Belize property to a resort in the late 1980s. Called Hidden Valley Inn, it had numerous waterfalls, including Belize's famous 1,000-foot Falls.\n\nIn 2001, Headley traded the waterfalls to Belize for more timberland. The waterfalls are now a national park.\n\nHeadley, the youngest of four boys, gained his nickname as a toddler, when a cow chased him and he ran into the house screaming he was being chased by a \"Bull.\"\n\n\"Never was a nickname so fitting,\" said George Headley, the youngest of Headley's five children.\n\nHeadley died in Belize in 2003 at age 87.\n\nBeard Street named for Welaunee Planation owner's granddaugher\n\nBeard Street, a residential street by Lafayette Park, is named for Letitia Beard – granddaughter of one of Leon County's early prominent residents, Robert Gamble.\n\nLetitia Beard owned 70 acres off North Gadsden Street between Sixth Avenue and Williams Street; the property had been part of the Lafayette Land Grant. In 1914, she sold the property to local developers, including Dr. Kent Johnston, who founded Tallahassee's first hospital on North Gadsden Street. Part of the property was developed as Meridian Heights subdivision (with a portion later donated for Lafayette Park).\n\nRobert and John Gamble were were prominent merchants in Virginia. Their father, Robert, was a Revolutionary War hero; their mother was Letitia Breckenridge, daughter of a Revolutionary War general. She turned down a marriage proposal from explorer Meriwether Lewis to marry Robert Gamble.\n\nIn 1826, John Gamble moved to Florida and established Waukeenah Plantation in Jefferson County; a year later, Robert Gamble, bought adjoining property and established Welaunee Plantation in Jefferson County.\n\nThe brothers later moved to Tallahasseee, while continuing to operate their Jefferson County plantations. John Gamble was the founder of the Union Bank, with Robert Gamble serving on the board.\n\nOne of Robert Gamble's sons, Robert Howard Gamble, served as Florida comptroller after the Civil War. One of John Gamble's sons, also named Robert, established a plantation in Manatee County, which is now a state park.\n\nLetitia Beard, named for her grandmother, was married to William Kelly Beard. Letitia Beard, 84, died in 1921 and is buried in Tallahassee's St. John's Episcopal cemetery.\n\nPond covers Coal Chute Park\n\nA stormwater treatment pond built for the FAMU Way extension now covers the original Coal Chute Park — a historic longtime Black community park.\n\nThe four-acre pond is at the west end of Railroad Square arts district, south of the adjacent railroad tracks.\n\nThe park was originally known as Villa Mitchell Park, the name of the surrounding community. The original park had basketball goals and playground equipment. Children in the neighborhood played softball, basketball and football in the park, and it was used for community events.\n\nIn 1994, the city bought the park, fenced it off, installed new playground equipment and named it Coal Chute Park. Legend holds the area, once part of a sawmill, was where train locomotives stopped to take on water and coal – which was delivered through a chute.\n\nThe park was dismantled in 2011 as it and nearby properties were bought for right of way of the FAMU Way extension. Construction of the pond was completed late last year.\n\nVilla Mitchell was the name of a suburban community developed in 1886 by C.L. Mitchell. It was bordered by Railroad Avenue, Gamble Street and the railroad in the large curve of the railroad before it crosses Lake Bradford Road. The streets were named for prominent figures of the day (President Grover Cleveland, Florida Gov. Edward Perry, Everglades developer Hamilton Disston). The neighborhood prospered for about 20 years. In 1891, Florida A&M moved to its current home on a hill above Villa Mitchell and the neighborhood became a Black residential area.\n\nOnce FAMU Way was completed, the park was paired with the Capital Cascades Trail, a pedestrian/biking path. The trail came to include a children's play area just east of the stormwater pond — replacing Coal Chute Park.\n\nApalachee Parkway named through a contest for original inhabitants\n\nThe Apalachee Parkway pays tribute to the first inhabitants of this area — and is the genesis of the names of the nearby city of Apalachicola and the Appalachian Mountains.\n\nThe Apalachee people occupied the area between the Aucilla and Ochlockonee rivers from the 1100s to 1700s. Famed as farmers and warriors, they were first encountered by Europeans during the expeditions of Spanish explorers Panfilo Narvaez and Hernando de Soto in the 1500s. The Apalachees lived with the Spanish at Mission San Luis from 1656 to 1704, before dispersing to Louisiana, where about 300 Apalachee descendants remain today.\n\nThe name Apalachee, from the Creek and Hitachi languages, has several interpretations. One interpretation is \"apalchi\" means \"allies.\" Another holds it means \"torch bearers\" or \"those who bring light.\" A third interpretation is \"apalahchi,\" means \"on the other side.\" The name Apalachicola joins \"apalahchi\" (other side) and \"okli\" (people), for \"people who lived on the other side\" of what is now the Apalachicola River.\n\nReports from the Narvaez and DeSoto expeditions indicated the Apalachee ranged as far north as the Appalachian Mountains, 350 miles from Tallahassee. So as early as 1563, Spanish cartographers were labeling the mountain range in today's Georgia and North Carolina, the \"Apalachen Mountains.\"\n\nApalachee Parkway was named in 1957, after this newspaper sponsored a contest to name the newly constructed road. Tallahassee native Bill Yancey was one of seven people to submit \"Apalachee,\" winning the contest because his entry was the earliest postmarked.\n\nThe parkway passes through the area believed to be Anhaica, the chief village of the Apalachees. The site of de Soto's 1539-1540 winter encampment among the Apalachees is one block south of the parkway.\n\nTMH name salutes World Wars I and II casualties\n\nTallahassee Memorial Healthcare — which celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2023 — is named in tribute to those who died in World War I and World War II.\n\nThe city had limited medical facilities its first 125 years of existence: a church and a hotel during the Civil War; the Masonic Lodge for whites and a small clinic for Black people in the early 1900s; a private sanitarium on North Gadsden Street for white people (1924-1964); the FAMU Hospital for Black people (1950-1971).\n\nIn 1941, responding to a clamor from Tallahassee's then-17,000 residents, city fathers announced plans to secure grants and issue bonds to build a hospital. But after purchasing 15 acres east of downtown, the city's plans were put on hold by World War II.\n\nIn 1946, after the war, the Baptist Church began operating a hospital in the wooden barracks of an abandoned World War II military medical complex of Dale Mabry Field. But after struggling financially for two years, the church asked the city to take over the hospital.\n\nIn January 1948, armed with a $1.5 million federal grant, the city began construction on a five-story hospital at Magnolia Drive and Miccosukee Road. In April, 1948, the city took over operation of the Baptist Hospital at Dale Mabry Field, where it operated for 18 months.\n\nOn Nov. 4, 1949, Tallahassee Memorial Hospital opened as a municipally operated hospital. In 1976, the hospital converted to a private, non-profit corporation and changed its name to Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center (TMRMC).\n\nIn 1998, for its 50th anniversary, TMRMC it restored its original TMH acronym by renaming itself Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare.\n\nCarroll house becomes a iconic restaurant trifecta\n\nTable 23 used to be the Front Porch restaurant and before that the former home of Chez Pierre Restaurant — though the tree-shrouded, two-story brick building at Thomasville Road and Sixth Avenue began life nearly 90 years ago as the home of Tallahassee businessman Fred Carroll.\n\nConstructed as a one-story home in 1924, it was rebuilt as a two-story home in 1935 following a storm.\n\nCarroll owned Capital City Ice Company, Capital City Bakeries, a Georgia fertilizer and peanut company and several parcels of local property. Carroll died in 1956 and his wife died in 1959. Son Fred Carroll Jr., and daughter Clara Jane Smith leased the building to a variety of businesses, including Bevis Funeral Home (1964-1968) and the Lt. Governor's Club (1993-1994) before selling it to Chez Pierre (1996-2012).\n\nThe two large oaks on the front lawn, the subject of some concern during remodeling efforts, were planted as saplings in 1936 after Thomasville Road construction had removed previous trees.\n\nLive Oak Plantation Road named after governor's property\n\nLive Oak Plantation Road, between Thomasville Road and Meridian Road, is named for the plantation established on its western end in the 19th century.\n\nMost of the plantation, which once stretched all the way to Lake Jackson, has been subdivided into home sites since the 1950s. Originally, Live Oak was the 10,000-acre plantation of John Branch, a governor and U.S. Senator from North Carolina.\n\nBranch moved to Tallahassee in the mid-1830s and served as sixth and last territorial governor before statehood in 1845. Branch's daughter married planter and merchant Arvah Hopkins, owner of Goodwood Plantation (and grandfather of the late longtime Tallahassee city manager Arvah Hopkins).\n\nAfter Branch, it passed through many owners, including Dr. Tennent Ronalds, a native of Scotland, who built one of Tallahassee's first golf courses on the property in 1903.\n\nRuediger Elementary honors former teacher\n\nLillian Ruediger Elementary School is named for a former Tallahassee school teacher and Leon County Schools administrator.\n\nLillian Josephine Cross Ruediger taught at Florida High before becoming general supervisor of Leon County Schools from 1945 to 1951. Ruediger, who oversaw elementary schools, resigned because of poor health and requested a transfer to a teaching position at Kate Sullivan Elementary. But Ruediger, 54, died at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital on Jan. 16, 1952 before she could resume her teaching career.\n\nRuediger (ROO-di-gher) Elementary at 526 W. 10th Ave. was named for her when it opened Sept. 6, 1955, the same day Griffin Middle School opened.\n\nRuediger was a native of Lake City, who enrolled at FSU in 1922 but did not graduate until 1930. She was married to Julius Ruediger, a longtime superintendent of the city's gas plant. Julius Ruediger died in 1958; his son, Herbert Ruediger, a longtime city employee, died in 1978.\n\nHouse built by Gov. John Martin marks site of earliest US Christmas\n\nThe chief structure at the De Soto site off East Lafayette Street — where Spaniards are believed to have celebrated the first Christmas (1539) in what became the United States — is the Gov. Martin House.\n\nThe brick, hunting lodge style home was built in 1934 by Florida Gov. John Wellborn Martin. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, it is now home to the Florida Bureau of Archaeological Research.\n\nMartin, a former mayor of Jacksonville, was governor of Florida from 1925 to 1929, presiding over the height and end of the Florida land boom. He spearheaded state highway construction and successfully advocated for a change to the state constitution to allow state funding of public elementary schools. In 1925, a new State Road Department building was constructed and named for him at 300 S. Adams St. — a building that served as Tallahassee City Hall from 1964 to 1982 and is the site of the current City Hall.\n\nMartin ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1928 and unsuccessfully for governor in 1932. Martin sold his Tallahassee property in 1941 and returned to Jacksonville, where he died in 1958.\n\nCobb named for principal\n\nTallahassee's first middle school, Cobb Middle School, is named for the first principal of its first elementary school: Elizabeth DeBerry Cobb.\n\nCobb was a native of Tallahassee who began teaching in 1915 at all-grades Leon High. In 1925, she became the first principal of Caroline Brevard Elementary, Tallahassee's first elementary-only school. In 1935, she became supervisor of Leon County Schools before leaving the school system in 1936.\n\nCobb went on to spend many years as house mother for the Ruge Episcopal Center at Florida State University and teach youth classes at St. John's Episcopal Church. In 1954, Cobb Junior High opened as Tallahassee's first junior high (now middle) school and was named for Cobb.\n\nWidowed before she was 30, and affectionately known as \"Bessie,\" Cobb lived most of her adult life in the Bradford-Cobb House at 403. N. Calhoun St. The home, in the Calhoun Street Historic District, was built in 1878-79. Cobb bought the home in 1921 and lived there until shortly before she died in 1974 at age 96. The home is now a law office.\n\nKate Sullivan was a teacher\n\nOne of Tallahassee's oldest elementary schools is named for Kate Sullivan, a beloved teacher in Tallahassee for 45 years.\n\nSullivan was a native of Tallahassee, who graduated from Florida State College, a forerunner of FSU. She taught many years at Caroline Brevard Elementary, the city's first elementary-only school, before retiring in spring 1948. In fall 1948, Kate Sullivan Elementary on Miccosukee Road and the now-defunct Wesson Elementary opened as the city's third and fourth elementary schools (after Caroline Brevard and Sealey Memorial).\n\nSullivan, who taught primarily English, was the favorite teacher of many students; a dozen prominent former pupils, including soon-to-be Gov. LeRoy Collins, were pallbearers at her 1953 funeral. Sullivan and her older sister, Mattie, neither of whom ever married, lived at 503 Beard Street.\n\nFurniture from their home is displayed at Goodwood Museum & Gardens. The glass-doored bookcase Kate Sullivan used in her Caroline Brevard classroom is at the library entrance of Kate Sullivan Elementary.\n\nChapman Pond named for Justice\n\nChapman Pond is the two-acre city park and pond at Merritt and Circle drives in the Myers Park neighborhood. It is named for former Florida Supreme Court Justice Roy H. Chapman, who once lived nearby.\n\nA native of Lake City, Chapman attended the University of Florida and Stetson Law School. He returned to Lake City and practiced law with Fred Cone, who later was elected the 27th governor of Florida (1937-1941). Cone nominated his law partner to the Supreme Court in 1937.\n\nChapman, who spent a term (1945-1947) as Chief Justice, served on the court until his death in 1952.\n\nIn the 19th century, Chapman Pond was one of three ponds on the Houstoun family's Lakeland Plantation. It was originally known as Wash Pond, because plantation slaves used it to do laundry.\n\nIt has also been known as Mosley Pond, DuVal Pond, Duck Pond and Sylvan Pond. It was named for Chapman on April 28, 1953.\n\nDorothy B. Oven Park\n\nThis seven-acre park on Thomasville Road just south of I-10 gained prominence in the 1930s as Camellia Gardens, one of the nation's largest commercial camellia nurseries.\n\nThe manor house was designed in 1936 by Alfred B. Maclay, creator of the nearby state park and gardens that bear his name. Maclay designed the house for Camellia Gardens co-owner Breckenridge Gamble, whose widow, Dorothy, married Tallahassee attorney Will Oven in 1960.\n\nUpon Dorothy's death in 1985, Will Oven donated the house and heavily landscaped grounds to the city of Tallahassee, with the provision it be named in honor of Dorothy B. Oven.\n\nA half-acre of the park houses a Tallahassee fire station. The house is used for meetings and weddings. The grounds attract thousands of residents at Christmas, when the park is decorated with holiday lights.\n\nCarroll's Quarters named for Black female owner\n\nThe term \"quarters\" to denote housing dates to the 16th century and was most often applied to military and servant lodgings. In the American South, it became the term for slave housing — and, after slavery, was still applied to clusters of Black homes.\n\nTallahassee had numerous \"quarters,\" including Gray's Quarters, Council Quarters, Henry Watson Quarters, Riley's Quarters and Collins Quarters. Some were named for the chief landlord of the quarters.\n\nOthers were named for the predominant Black landowner — such as Carroll's Quarters, in the area behind where Whole Foods Grocery replaced the Miracle Theater. Annie Carroll owned much of the still-residential neighborhood bordered by Thomasville Road, Pine Street, Ninth Avenue and Mitchell Street.\n\nOne of the landmarks of Carroll's Quarters was Oliver's Grocery at 1563 Pine Street, operated into the early 1970s by Alberta Oliver, grandaughter-in-law of Annie Carroll.\n\nThe cross street nearest the store is Gwen Street, named for Oliver's granddaughter. Alberta Oliver died in 2000; Gwen Oliver Parker, a TCC instructor, died in 2005. The former store was then used for storage by retired local football and track coach Billy Oliver, son of Alberta and father of Gwen.\n\nTrimble Road named for hardware store owner who pioneered neighborhood\n\nTrimble Road, which connects Tharpe Street and Hartsfield Road on Tallahassee's west side, is named for the late Jesse Trimble, a hardware store owner who built one of the first homes on the street.\n\nTrimble, a native of Sandy Springs, Ga., came to Tallahassee in 1920 and worked many years as a bookkeeper and insurance agent. In 1944, he became a partner in Ralph Johnson's Hardware at 121 E. Jefferson Street (now the site of the House Office Building). In 1946, the two men built a new store at 1315 N. Monroe.\n\nIn 1956, after Johnson's retirement, Trimble moved across the street to a building on the southwest corner of Monroe Street and Seventh Avenue. In 1959, Trimble retired and sold his store to Nick Eppes and Henry Edenfield, who operated Eppes-Edenfield Hardware until 1995.\n\nIn 1948, Trimble built a home on 10 acres of a former pecan grove. In more recent times, the county graded the dirt trail from Tharpe Street to Trimble's home — with country road foreman Aubry Ott naming it Trimble Road. Trimble died in 1979. Since 1965, Jesse Trimble Jr., a retired Leon County Schools custodian, lived in the home he built next door to his father.\n\nAppleyard Drive named for Confederate Navy man, newspaper owner\n\nThis westside thoroughfare that fronts now Tallahassee State College is named for Thomas Jefferson Appleyard, an early Tallahassee newspaper editor, printer and government official.\n\nT.J. Appleyard was secretary of the Florida Senate from 1895 to 1905. In 1909, he became the state printer and also published the weekly Florida Record newspaper. During the legislative sessions of 1913, 1915, 1917 and 1919, he published the Record as the daily Florida Morning News newspaper. In 1919, he sold his newspaper to the rival Tallahassee Democrat but continued to operate a printing company, which was sold after his death to the present-day Rose Printing Company.\n\nAppleyard, who joined the Confederate Navy at 12 and later was the major general of the Florida Division of United Confederate Veterans, died in 1931.\n\nWakulla County springs from famous spring\n\n2023 was the 180th anniversary of neighboring Wakulla County, which was established as the state's 23rd county on March 11, 1843.\n\nThe county's name comes from its most famous feature, Wakulla Springs, which dazzled early Native Americans and Spanish explorers. Indigenous people called Wakulla Springs \"Tah-ille-ya-ahan,\" which supposedly meant, \"place where the water flows upward like the rays of heavenly light out of the shadow of a hill.\" But Spanish explorers named it Guacara, their phonetic spelling of a Timucuan town whose name they adopted for a string of missions in North Florida.\n\nGuacara was pronounced Wakala by subsequent Native Americans (and later spelled Wakulla). Popular lore holds the name Wakulla means \"mysterious waters.\" But experts have long dismissed that explanation as \"entirely fanciful\" — while agreeing the meaning of the original Timucuan town is a mystery.\n\nHow Martin Luther King Boulevard came to be\n\nLongtime residents still occasionally call this \"Boulevard Street,\" as it was known for 150 years. Legend holds it was named in phonetic honor of 19th century South American freedom fighter Simon Bolivar.\n\nOthers say it was named for its appearance as a heavily treed \"boulevard\" buffering the city's western edge (much as the downtown chain of parks buffered the northern end of town).\n\nIt was chosen for renaming in honor of the 20th century civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. because it ran in front of Bethel Missionary Baptist Church, whose pastor, C.K. Steele, was one of King's lieutenants with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Because of protests by some residents, the name change came in two pieces, the south half in 1980 and the north half in 1984.\n\n▶'Freedom is never given freely': Remembering when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Tallahassee\n\nJohnston Street inspired by service of sanitarium doctor\n\nThis one-block street from Thomasville Road to North Gadsden Street is named for Dr. John Kent Johnston, who operated Tallahassee's first hospital at 805 N. Gadsden St.\n\nJohnston was a Tallahassee native, graduate of West Florida Seminary (forerunner of FSU) and co-owner of Tallahassee's first airplane in the 1920s with Ivan Munroe and Theo Proctor. The 12-bed Johnston Sanitarium opened in July 1924 and operated until 1944, three years after Johnston's death.\n\nIn November 1947, the building became the Seventh Day Adventist-operated Forsyth Sanitarium, named for Edna Forsyth, the Central Florida dentist who donated the $51,000 purchase price.\n\nThe Forsyth Sanitarium closed in 1964 and the building later served as the home of the Leon County Guidance Center (1969-1972), Apalachee Mental Health Clinic (1973-1986) and attorney offices. Since 1997, it has been the home of Moore Bass Consulting.\n\nPensacola Street one of our oldest paved roads\n\nPensacola Street, named for the city toward which it runs, is one of Tallahassee's oldest paved roads. It was originally constructed in 1916-1918, heading west from Monroe Street to near today's Appleyard Drive.\n\nIn 1928-29, with the creation of Tallahassee's first airport near Appleyard Drive, Pensacola Street was repaved and a bridge built over a swampy area that became the site of Doak Campbell Stadium (1950).\n\nBy the 1960s, the road had been extended to connect with State Road 20, which crosses North Florida from Palatka to Niceville (30 miles east of Pensacola). In 2002, the Pensacola Street bridge was eliminated with the re-routing of the street around Doak Campbell Stadium.\n\nPensacola, on the western edge of the state, was Florida's first European settlement (1559). But the city was abandoned two years later because of a hurricane, making St. Augustine (1565) the oldest continuously occupied city in the present-day United States; Pensacola was not re-established until 1698.\n\nThe name Pensacola is derived from a Native American tribe that occupied the area, the Pansfalaya, whose name meant \"long-haired people.\"\n\nArchitect Phillips was eccentric mausoleum, clock maker; his skull is still missing\n\nTwo of the most interesting structures ever constructed in Tallahassee were designed and built by the same man: An eccentric architect named Calvin Phillips, who created the long-gone clock tower on South Macomb Street and a mausoleum at Oakland Cemetery.\n\nPhillips was a famed New York architect who received a medal from France for designing buildings for the 1889 Paris World's Fair (whose most famous exhibit was the new Eiffel Tower).\n\nIn 1907, Phillips retired to Tallahassee, leaving behind a wife and two daughters in New York. By 1910, he had built a small home and 30-foot-tall clock tower at 815 S. Macomb St., earning a reputation as a recluse with a long white beard.\n\nIn 1919, he built his mausoleum, often sleeping inside the structure during construction. He died in November 1919; though his family never joined him, the mausoleum had slots for four caskets.\n\nIn the late 1970s/early 1980s, the clock tower was torn down by new owners of the property. In 2000, the mausoleum was vandalized and Phillips' skull was removed from his casket — and never recovered.\n\nWhen Phillips died, the few Tallahasseeans who'd seen him described him as a lean man, with a white beard spiraling below his waist. He's inspired ghost stories as some have reported that a gaunt, spindly figure was seen perched atop the tomb.\n\nJohn Knox: Presbyterian founder's name on short but major road\n\nThis major (if short) thoroughfare from North Monroe Street to Meridian Road began in 1958 as just a service road from Meridian Road to newly constructed Faith Presbyterian Church.\n\nChurch members named it John Knox Road, after the founder of the Presbyterian Church in Scotland. In 1964, it was extended down the hill to the area near today's Trousdell Aquatics complex. In 1971, during construction of the Tallahassee Mall, the road was extended to North Monroe Street, where it meets Monticello Drive and forms a major intersection.\n\nThe greatness of Gaither inspires name for multiple landmarks\n\nIt is the 30th anniversary of the death of legendary Florida A&M football coach Jake Gaither — for whom everything Gaither-named in Tallahassee (street, golf course, community center, FAMU gymnasium, etc.) honors.\n\nOne of six children of a Methodist minister in Dayton, Tenn., he was born Alonzo Smith Gaither. As one of the youngest students at Knoxville College, he was required to do chores for upperclassmen who inexplicably began calling him \"Jake.\" The name stuck, with encouragement from Gaither because, \"I liked the name Jake better than the name Alonzo.\"\n\nA champion debater in college, Gaither planned to enter the ministry until his father died his senior year, forcing him to take a job as a teacher to help support his family. He taught at two schools before being hired as an instructor, assistant football coach and head basketball coach at FAMU in 1937.\n\nIn 1945, he became the FAMU head football coach — and led the Rattlers to greatness. He coached 25 seasons (1945-1969), led the Rattlers to seven Black national championships, three unbeaten seasons and a career record of 203-36-4. He was a three-time national coach of the year and was elected to the College Hall of Fame.\n\nHe staged annual football clinics at FAMU that drew top-name white coaches. He engineered 1969's FAMU-University of Tampa game, the first in the South to pit a predominantly Black school against a predominantly white school. He sent numerous players to the NFL, including Willie Galimore, Ken Riley and Bob Hayes. Gaither was famous for his oratory and lines such as, \"I want my players hostile, agile and mobile.\"\n\nGaither died Feb. 18, 1994 at age 90. Sadie, his beloved wife of 62 years, died in 1997 at 92.\n\nHayden Road, home of Seminole football stars, was named for prof, wife\n\nHayden Road, an apartment- and condo-filled street overlooking Florida State University's Doak Campbell Stadium, is believed to commemorate a long-ago professor and his wife.\n\nEdwin Andrew Hayden was a popular professor of philosophy and psychology at Florida State College for Women from 1915 until his self-inflicted death in 1921 at age 51.\n\nHayden dazzled students with his psychology experiments, but suffered bouts of depression and had a nervous breakdown shortly before his death. After his death, Hayden's wife, Clara, was hired as FSCW's chief library assistant, a position she held for 25 years. Clara, who never remarried, died in 1970 in the home on Pensacola Street she had shared with her husband and raised their two children in.\n\nHayden Road is the home of Burt Reynolds Hall, once an apartment complex that served as the football team's dorm from 1987 until a 1995 NCAA rule change eliminated athletes-only dorms. It is now set for demolition.\n\nA new FSU dorm, for football players, Champions Hall, rose at Hayden Road and Belle Vue Way.\n\nWilson Street named for contractor, Lafayette Park builder\n\nWilson Street, which runs between Meridian Street and Miccosukee Road in the Lafayette Park neighborhoood, is named for William H. Wilson, a Tallahassee contractor and early developer of St. George Island.\n\nWilson was born in nearby Thomas County, Ga., but grew up in Tallahassee. In 1922, he founded Wilson Construction and Supply Company, which built many of the homes in the Lafayette Park neighborhood. In the early 1960s, he was a co-developer of St. George Island and helped push for the 1965 construction of today's Bryant Patton Bridge from the mainland.\n\nWilson built the first apartment house in Tallahassee, the Wilsonian Apartments, on a block bounded by Tennessee, Bronough, Call and Duval streets, which had been the site of the Leon Academy, a forerunner of Leon High. The site is now the City Centre parking garage.\n\nWilson also owned Wilson Beach Cottages at St. Teresa Beach, a complex of cabins originally built for World War II Army officers stationed at nearby Camp Gordon Johnston, which was a training ground for the D-Day invasion. Wilson died in 1969.\n\nLeMoyne: An early French painter of Florida Native Americans\n\nThe LeMoyne Center for the Visual Arts is named in honor of France's Jacques le Moyne de Morgues, the first European artist to paint pictures of Native Americans in Florida.\n\nLeMoyne came to Northeast Florida in 1564 as an illustrator and cartographer with the expedition of French explorer Jean Ribault. In addition to landscapes and maps of Florida, LeMoyne painted numerous pictures of indigenous Timucuans, which remain the iconic images of Florida's early residents.\n\nThe LeMoyne Art Foundation was organized in 1963 by four Tallahassee women: Nanette Fisher, Clifton Lewis, Mary Metzke and June Strauss. The foundation opened its first gallery in 1964 in the former Deeb House on the northwest corner of Calhoun Street and College Avenue (once a Po' Boys restaurant deck/parking lot).\n\nIn 1968, LeMoyne moved to its current home in the historic Meginnis-Munroe House at 125 N. Gadsden St.\n\nWesson started as school named for a mayor who offered Babe Ruth a job\n\nThe school district's multi-use R.N. Gooden-Nancy Russell Center at Wesson on South Meridian Street spent nearly a half century as Leonard Wesson Elementary, which was named for a former Tallahassee city commissioner and Leon County School Board chairman.\n\nThe school began in 1946 as Prince Murat Elementary, housed in the former military barracks of Dale Mabry Field. It moved in 1949 to 2813 S. Meridian St., and was renamed South City Elementary. In 1956, it was renamed Wesson Elementary, following the death of Leonard A. Wesson. In 2006, Wesson Elementary merged with Bond Elementary and its building was converted to the Gooden-Russell Center.\n\nWesson was a Tallahassee city commissioner for one term (1935-38), serving twice as mayor. In 1935, Mayor Wesson offered just-retired baseball star Babe Ruth the position as manager of the Tallahassee Capitals, a minor league baseball team (Ruth declined). Wesson served on the Leon County School Board from 1940-1947, including a stint as chairman.\n\nWesson died in December 1955, when he suffered a heart attack while turkey hunting. At the time of his death, Wesson was president of the local Coca Cola bottling company and had recently resigned as chairman of the state Game and Fish Commission because of health issues.\n\nOnce known as Bullfrog Pond and a place for baptisms, Lake Ella endures\n\nOriginally known as Bull Pond (and earlier as Bullfrog Pond), it was originally a natural lake used for baptisms, Emancipation Day celebrations and fishing.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was renamed the more pleasant-sounding Lake Ella by the wife of developer William Anderson, who developed the surrounding Anderson Heights housing development.\n\nIt remained a popular fishing lake into the 1950s and site of Tallahassee's annual Fourth of July fireworks into the 1970s.\n\nWidening of North Monroe in 1968 led to pollution and it was retrofitted as part of the city's stormwater system.\n\nNow officially known as Fred Drake Park at Lake Ella (Drake was a businessman and civic leader), the park has an encircling sidewalk, gazebo and aerating fountains and is popular with walkers, joggers, bicyclists and ducks.\n\nLaundry owner, county leader lends name to Tom Brown Park\n\nTom Brown Park is 255 acres of former federal land given to the county in 1972 and named for County Commissioner Tom Brown, who had died the year before.\n\nBrown served two terms on the County Commission and was a businessman who operated several laundries and a service station.\n\nHe also had a big background in sports: A former Clemson football star, he spent two years as the Leon High football coach and was a longtime Babe Ruth League baseball coach.\n\nHe was renowned for playing first base in city league softball games — without a glove. The county built the original part of the park, which is operated by the city.\n\nAs a fitting memory for a coach, Tom Brown Park features several softball and baseball fields, racquet and tennis courts, a disc golf course, a 3.1-mile-long bike and nature trails, and a fenced area for dogs to frolic.\n\nGibbs Drive and Gibbs Hall named for secretary of state who broke color barrier\n\nA northside Tallahassee street, a Florida A&M University dormitory and a St. Petersburg high school are named for Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs, Florida's first Black Secretary of State, first superintendent of Public Instruction and a delegate to the state's 1868 Constitutional Convention.\n\nGibbs was born (1821) a free Black man in Philadelphia, graduated from Dartmouth College and became a minister in Philadelphia. After the Civil War, he moved to Charleston as a missionary to newly freed slaves.\n\nIn 1867, he moved to Jacksonville and operated a private school before becoming heavily involved in Reconstruction politics.\n\nAs Secretary of State (1868-1872), he conducted investigations into the Ku Klux Klan. He was elected to the Tallahassee City Council in 1872 and died in Tallahassee in 1874.\n\nHis son, Thomas Van Renssalaer Gibbs, was a co-founder of FAMU in 1887. The FAMU dorm was demolished in 2023 to make way for newer dorms.\n\nRaymond Diehl: Pipefitter, liquor baron and developer\n\nRaymond Diehl Road in northeast Tallahassee is named for Raymond Diehl Sr., a prominent businessman who built a home in the 1930s near the corner of Thomasville Road and present-day Raymond Diehl Road.\n\nCapital Health Plan now occupies the site. Originally, the road was a dirt trail from Thomasville Road to near Centerville Road. Construction of I-10 in the early 1970s severed the road into the current two pieces on either side of I-10. Diehl was a pipefitter who operated a plumbing supply store then segued into real estate development.\n\nAfter Leon County voters approved liquor sales in 1960, Diehl and his son, Raymond Jr., opened five liquor stores (later sold to the ABC Liquor chain). For 53 years, Raymond Sr.'s wife, O'Neill Diehl, operated O'Neill's Fairy Tale Shop, a popular children's clothing store.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Raymond Diehl Jr. and his wife, June, developed the Betton Place shopping center, where June operated the upscale Haystack clothing store for 17 years.\n\nRaymond Diehl died in 1968 of a heart attack while hunting; O'Neill Diehl died in 1988. Raymond Diehl Jr. died in 2003.\n\nGaines Street and Gainesville named for famed Army general\n\nGaines Street, one of Tallahassee's most notable thoroughfares, is named for a famous 19th century U.S. Army general, Edmund Pendleton Gaines.\n\nGaines was born in 1777 in Virginia, where his great-uncle and his father were prominent in the American Revolution. As a young military officer, Gaines was responsible for surveying Mississippi and constructing the Natchez Trace road. In 1807, Gaines arrested former U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr in Alabama on charges of treason and transported Burr to Richmond, Va., where he was acquitted in a trial.\n\nGaines became a hero of the War of 1812, when he commanded forces that prevented the British from taking Fort Erie. He played a prominent role in the first two Seminole Wars (1817-1818, 1835-1842) and spent several years arbitrating disputes between white settlers and Native Americans. Gaines opposed removal of Native Americans from their traditional lands and gained a reputation for treating the tribes fairly.\n\nIn 1824, the first Florida territorial council to meet in Tallahassee made Gaines one of the first names attached to a Tallahassee street. Cities in Florida, Texas and Georgia were named Gainesville. Fort Gaines, a historic fort near Mobile, is named for him. Gaines died in 1849.\n\nCoincidentally, Col. Edmund Pendleton Gaines (possibly a descendant), was the third of four base commanders of Dale Mabry Field, Tallahassee's World War II Army Air Corps base. Col. Gaines served at Dale Mabry from Sept. 1943 through June 1944 – gaining notoriety in October 1943 when he threatened to make Tallahassee off limits to military personnel because of an outbreak of venereal disease.\n\nVenereal disease became a statewide epidemic in 1943, as Florida became the training ground for hundreds of thousands of military personnel. Gaines sent a letter to the city officials calling for \"more aggressive measures to control prostitution and promiscuity.\" The crisis eventually waned.\n\nState owns historic Brokaw-McDougall House\n\nThe Brokaw-McDougall House is the well-landscaped two-story home at Meridian Street and Miccosukee Road. It was built by pioneering businessman Peres Bonney Brokaw.\n\nBorn in 1814 in New Jersey to French immigrants, Brokaw arrived in Tallahassee in 1840. He and a partner began a successful livery business at Calhoun and Pensacola streets, which operated until the Civil War.\n\nBrokaw built his home from 1856 to 1860 — a period during which he also served on the Tallahassee city council, Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate. Following Brokaw's death in 1875, the house passed to a daughter, who married businessman Alexander McDougall (who, after his wife's death, married another of Brokaw's daughters). The McDougall descendants continued to live in the home until it was sold to the state in 1973.\n\nThe family's original 640-acre property, stretching a half-mile east along Miccosukee Road, once encompassed all of today's Leon High School property and was filled with crops and cows. Brokaw elaborately landscaped the area around the home — and according to unproven legend received advice from Frederick Law Olmstead, the landscape architect who designed New York's Central Park.\n\nIn 1998, the state leased the home to the city, which hosted weddings, receptions and art shows. In 2011, the state reclaimed the property to house its Division of Cultural Affairs.\n\nLate Cherokee Hotel connected to Jim Morrison of The Doors\n\nThe 2012 pardon of the late rock singer Jim Morrison by Gov. Charlie Crist for a 1969 Miami conviction had many readers wondering: Where was the Cherokee Hotel?\n\n\"Room 206, Cherokee Hotel,\" was the address Morrison gave to Tallahassee police in September 1963 when he was arrested for disturbing the peace while a student at FSU.\n\nAs longtime residents know, the 4-story Cherokee Hotel was on the southwest corner of Park Avenue and Calhoun Street (across the street from the Knott House).\n\nThe Cherokee Hotel was built in 1922 and demolished in 1964. One presumes it was a temporary address in 1963 for Morrison, as the transfer from St. Petersburg Junior College looked for an apartment following the start of classes five days before.\n\nNylic Street an abbreviated named for business interest of Wadsworth's\n\nStreets of a small enclave of rental houses and apartments near FSU are named for its developers — and an insurance company.\n\nHowell Wadsworth, a Tallahassee real estate entrepreneur and insurance executive, once owned land at West Tennessee and Brevard streets, where, among other things, he was responsible for creating a housing development in the early 1950s.\n\nThe street that runs off Tennessee Street is named Wadsworth; another is named Hancock, for Wadsworth's development partner, Melvin Hancock. A third street is named Nylic, an acronym for New York Life Insurance Company, for whom Wadsworth was an agent for 40 years.\n\nWadsworth owned numerous tracts of land in Tallahassee, including parcels that include today's Riley Elementary School (for which he donated the land), Callen neighborhood, Fourth Quarter restaurant and a downtown square on Tennessee Street between Bethel Missionary Baptist Church and the federal building.\n\nWadsworth's late wife, Alice, was the sister of Florida Gov. LeRoy Collins; his son, Murray Wadsworth, is a longtime Tallahassee attorney. Howell Wadsworth died in 1985.\n\nGardens of Edenfield: A couple's legacy inspires road name\n\nEdenfield Road, which connects Miccosukee Road to the Mahan Highway, is named for Lawrence and Isabella Edenfield – who became famous for allowing townspeople to grow vegetable gardens on their property on Edenfield Road.\n\nLawrence, a native of Grand Ridge, was a teacher and principal at several North Florida schools, then worked for the state Department of Education. Isabella was a native of Indiana, who taught at Leon High and worked for the Dean of Public Administration at FSU. They married in 1928 and had two children. In the late 1940s, the couple bought a 90-acre tract at the southwest corner of Miccosukee Road and Edenfield Road, then a dirt road.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, the Edenfields began allowing needy FSU students and neighboring Black residents to grow vegetables in plots on their land. The Edenfields eventually expanded the program, providing space for professors, physicians, attorneys and other Tallahassee residents to grow vegetables. Lawrence Edenfield prepared and provided the land for free for many years (eventually charging a token $5 per row per year).\n\nThe garden program ended shortly after the deaths, just two months apart in 1979, of Lawrence (January) and Isabella (March). The Edenfields' farm house still stands, though it's now located on Berklie Drive — a name created out of the initials of the Edenfields, their daughter and son-in-law.\n\nMabry Manor has WWII street names\n\nThe streets of Mabry Manor are named for World War II generals and soldiers because it was once the home of Tallahassee's World War II Army Air Corps base — though the streets were not named for military personnel when it was a base.\n\nDale Mabry Air Field existed from 1941-1945. It occupied 559 acres bordered by present-day Roberts Avenue (on the north) and Mabry Street (east). The streets of the military base were identified by letters (Avenue C, Avenue D, etc.) and numbers (Third Street, Fourth Street, etc.). After the base closed, the land reverted to the city, which gave it to FSU, which used it as its West Campus from 1946 to 1956.\n\nIn 1952, at the request of the U.S. post office, the city gave the streets new names, honoring U.S. military leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Douglas MacArthur, Hap Arnold, Matthew Ridgway, George Patton, etc. Nininger Street was named for Army Lt. Alexander Nininger, the first World War II winner of the Medal of Honor.\n\nAfter FSU departed, the former base became home to the Mabry Manor housing subdivision and Sabal Palm Elementary School. A short distance west, also off Roberts Avenue, is Seminole Manor, a housing development built by Syde Deeb from 1948 to 1950.\n\nDuval Street named for man who set our capital status\n\nThis north-south artery in downtown Tallahassee, as well as Jacksonville's Duval County, is named for the first civilian territorial governor of Florida, William Pope DuVal (who capitalized the V in his last name).\n\nDuVal had been a U.S. Congressman from Kentucky and territorial judge in St. Augustine, before serving as Florida governor from 1822 to 1834 — making him the longest-serving governor in state history. Under DuVal, Tallahassee was chosen as the capital of Florida, and DuVal lived in a home in today's Myers Park.\n\nA colorful raconteur who ran away from home as a teenager, DuVal once shared a stagecoach ride with author Washington Irving, who recounted DuVal's adventures in a short story titled \"The Early Experiences of Ralph Ringwood.\" DuVal moved to Texas in 1848 and died in 1854.\n\nRed Barber Way honors voice of Dodgers, NPR\n\nThe street encircling WFSU television and radio studios, as well as a camellia garden in the downtown Chain of Parks, is named for legendary major league baseball announcer Walter \"Red\" Barber, who lived the last 20 years of his life in Tallahassee.\n\nBarber broadcast for three major league teams, most famously the Brooklyn Dodgers, where he popularized such colorful terms as \"rhubarb\" and \"sitting in the catbird seat.\"\n\nAfter retiring from broadcasting, Barber penned numerous books, wrote a weekly column for the Tallahassee Democrat and appeared every Friday on National Public Radio's \"Morning Edition,\" where he often extolled the beauties of Tallahassee camellias.\n\nBarber died in 1992.\n\nBloxham gets park, street, building as governor who urged creation of FAMU\n\nWilliam Dunnington Bloxham was a Tallahassee native who became Florida's first governor to serve two times (1881-1885 and 1897-1901).\n\nHis most notable achievements were selling four million acres of the Everglades for $1 million to restore the state's financial stability and urging creation of what became Florida A&M University.\n\nBloxham died in 1911 and is buried in St. John's Cemetery. His one-time home at 410 N. Calhoun St. has been restored and is used for offices.\n\nBloxham Park is between Monroe and Calhoun streets in the Park Avenue chain of parks.\n\nBloxham Street runs between Gadsden Street and M.L. King Boulevard.\n\nThe Bloxham Building, in the 700 block of South Calhoun Street, is the former Caroline Brevard Elementary.\n\nCollege Avenue originally called Clinton Street\n\nCollege Avenue, the street that basically runs from downtown to the gates of Florida State University, spent nearly a century named Clinton Street.\n\nLike many early Tallahassee street names, the name was applied at the time of the city's founding in 1824 to honor a national leader, either George Clinton, a U.S. vice-president under two presidents (Jefferson and Madison) or New York statesman Dewitt Clinton.\n\nThough the original incarnation of FSU opened its doors in 1857, the street name was not changed to College Avenue until 1916. By then, the western end had been paved (1912), broadened from 24 feet to 30 feet and lined with oaks and stately private homes (since demolished or remodeled into businesses and sorority/fraternity houses).\n\nNeamathla led tribe near Lake Lafayette\n\nA residential street in northeast Leon County, Neamathla Trail, is named for the most significant Native American in Tallahassee history: Neamathla, who gave Americans \"permission\" to establish Tallahassee as the capital of Florida.\n\nNeamathla was the chief spokesman for Seminoles in the negotiation of the September 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, which attempted to relocate Seminoles in Florida. Territorial Gov. William DuVal praised Neamathla as \"the greatest man you will see among the Indians, who controls his warriors with as much ease as a colonel his regiment.\"\n\nNeamathla led the larger of two tribes occupying the Tallahassee area; the older Chefixico led the smaller band. Both tribes lived near Lake Lafayette, east of Tallahassee.\n\nIn October 1823, territorial commissioners John Lee Williams and William Simmons, met with Neamathla to tell him of the new territory's plan to locate its capital in Tallahassee. Neamathla objected but gave his grudging approval with the stipulation they not tell other Seminoles of his consent.\n\nA year later, Neamathla threatened to make the streets of Tallahassee \"run red with blood,\" unless the white settlers left.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/08"}]}

Let's take a look back at the most admirable student-athletes of the high school season.\n\nPolytech girls lacrosse coach Lynn Richardson knew Ali McKay had the potential to score goals. That's why she moved McKay from defense to midfield before her sophomore season.\n\nMcKay was solid last year, earning second-team All-State honors. But this year, after some encouragement from her coach and teammates, she really turned it on. The junior led the Panthers with 104 goals, and was named the state's Player of the Year by the Delaware Girls Lacrosse Coaches Association.\n\n\"She's a well-rounded athlete, and she's a competitor, but I wouldn't say she is someone who is full of herself or overly confident,\" Richardson said. \"We had to encourage her to shoot and drive to the goal.\"\n\nOnce the Panthers convinced her she could do it, the sky was the limit. READ MORE\n\nGIRLS LACROSSE FIRST-TEAM ALL-STATE\n\nAndrew Pettit had only one assist and no goals in his final high school lacrosse game.\n\nBut when it was over and Salesianum had secured a 12-2 victory in the semifinals of the DIAA Boys Lacrosse Tournament, the Tower Hill star was still the first topic of discussion for the Sals.\n\n\"We shut down Pettit,\" goalkeeper Ryan Kern said. \"That was basically our whole game plan tonight, shut down Pettit.\"\n\nWhy would an opponent focus its entire defense on one man? Because Pettit finished his glittering career with school records for goals, assists and points, was a three-time first-team All-State selection and a two-time U.S. Lacrosse All-American. And this year, the Delaware Boys Lacrosse Coaches Association named Pettit the state's Player of the Year.\n\n\"What sets him apart are his stick skills and ability to create offense,\" Tower Hill coach Brad duPont said. \"He has tremendous vision, and he knows where everybody is. He can put the ball on people's sticks.\"\n\nHe can put the ball in the net, too. And he can do it from any angle.

It was the first time I was playing for a team. I was so disappointed; I didn't want to let my team down.\n\n\"I went home and told my parents that was the worst feeling ever and I didn't want to ever feel that again. I swore to myself I would never let my teammates down again.\" READ MORE\n\nGIRLS TENNIS FIRST-TEAM ALL-STATE\n\nColt Williamson is on the road, a passenger in transit somewhere between Delaware and Maine. He listens on his cell phone, then redirects a question to his father.\n\n\"Do you have a claim to fame, Dad?\" he says.\n\n\"Tell him you are\" is the reply.\n\nThe subject is tennis, and for good reason. Williamson had just capped off his junior year at Milford High, having won the state boys singles championship. With his father, Rex, and \"Pop Pop,\" Paul Williamson, coaching the team, Colt became the first Buccaneers No. 1 singles player to win a state title. Ever.\n\n\"That means a lot,\" Williamson said, \" not just for me but for Milford finally having a state champ. Downstate, it's pretty much always been Caesar Rodney for as long as I've known. So, it's pretty nice to change it up a little bit and bring it to Milford.\" READ MORE\n\nBOYS TENNIS FIRST-TEAM ALL-STATE\n\nDuring a soccer game, Michelle Laz is like a shark.\n\nAlways in motion.\n\n\"I try to move around a lot,\" she said. \"I don't stay stationary. If I see an open space, I quickly go there and call for the ball. Moving around is the best part of my game.\"\n\nLaz found enough openings this spring to be named the state's Girls Soccer Player of the Year by the Delaware Soccer Coaches Association. The senior never stopped in leading Sussex Tech to a 13-4 season and a spot in the DIAA Division I semifinals.\n\nSoccer is a long game, with a half lasting 40 minutes at the high-school level. Defenses threw everything but the kitchen sink at Laz, often shutting her down for long stretches. But more often than not, the end result was the same.\n\nLate in the game, Laz would send a screamer into the back of the net, and the Ravens would celebrate a victory. READ MORE\n\nGIRLS SOCCER FIRST XI\n\nThe high school golf season in Delaware can be boiled down to one event: The DIAA State Tournament.\n\nAll of the nine-hole matches held during the regular season fade into the background when the annual 36-hole test tees off at the end of the year. The golfer best able to handle the stress of the big occasion emerges as the champion.\n\nFor the second straight season, Salesianum's Liam Murphy passed the test with flying colors.\n\nLast year, Murphy pulled away over the final nine holes at Dover's Maple Dale Country Club to win by four strokes. This year, the senior broke out of the pack again at Wilmington Country Club on May 26-27 to win by five and earn his second straight Golfer of the Year honor.\n\n\"There's really no better feeling than to be able to go in there and pull it off, and prove to yourself that you can do it,\" Murphy said. \"All of those hours that you put in were worth it.\" READ MORE\n\nALL-STATE GOLF TEAM\n\nIn a sport whose defining adjectives are \"faster,\" \"higher\" and \"stronger,\" Ashley Bailey is all of the above.\n\nSoaring 18 inches higher than any other Delaware girl ever before pole vaulted, excelling in five other events and leading her team to unprecedented success, the Middletown High senior won the Bill Thomson Award as the state's outstanding high school track athlete.\n\nJust this past Sunday, Bailey vaulted 13 feet at the Junior Olympic Regionals at Stockton (N.J.) University, in a performance she would have undoubtedly reached during the high school season, but for the other work she had taken on.\n\nRequiring speed, strength and jumping ability, the pole vault attracts the sport's most versatile athletes. But the compact schedule of a track meet prevents most vaulters from showing their skills in other events. Bailey, though, invariably performed in the maximum four events.

Six of the top 12 milers in Delaware history competed this spring, five of them graduating last month.\n\nIn this elite field, Kieran Tuntivate dominated. The Harvard-bound senior broke the state records in the mile and 1,600 meters both indoors and out, became Delaware's third-fastest ever at 3,200 meters, set a school record in the 800 to clinch the Blue Hen Conference championship for Charter School of Wilmington and earned national notice at major invitational races.\n\nIn a year when Mykele Young-Sanders of Dover overcame mid-season injury to complete an unprecedented three-year sweep of the hurdles events and Jarod Wilson of Newark became Delaware's fastest half-miler in 30 years, Tuntivate earned the Tom Fort Award as the state's top male track athlete.

A perfect game in a DIAA state final. Two state championships. A career ERA of 0.70, and a career average of 14.2 strikeouts per seven innings.\n\nSo even though the Bulldogs came up short in their bid for a three-peat, Green was a clear choice as The News Journal's Softball Player of the Year. The senior's contribution in the dugout was as important as her work in the pitcher's circle.\n\n\"I became a better leader on the team,\" she said. \"You usually think of the pitcher as one of the leaders, but I had never really been in that spot because of the seniors that we've had.

He struck out 147 in 72 innings, and allowed just 25 hits, 16 walks and three earned runs. The opposition flailed away to a .116 batting average.\n\n\"He was as dominant of a pitcher as I've ever seen, coached, been around,\" Hodgson coach Chris Moxley said.\n\nHe set a state record with six shutouts, threw a no-hitter April 2 against St. Georges and set another state mark with 19 strikeouts against A.I. du Pont on May 11.

It’s a huge event for sure but we’ve played in big games. It’s what we’re built for.”\n\nDelaware FC has won big games, succeeding through a difficult regular-season schedule and then a rugged qualification process to get to Colorado.\n\n“We’ve come together as a team and we just play and we win,” said center back N.K. Tima, heading into his senior year at Appoquinimink.\n\nThe 17 players include 12 rising high school seniors and five soon-to-be juniors. They represent 10 different high schools, including five players from Appoquinimink and three from Salesianum, winner of nine straight state titles and 14 in the past 15 years.\n\nPLAY DAY: Youth soccer's opportunity on display at 76ers Fieldhouse\n\nTima is joined by Appo teammates Aidan McCade, the only player on the team actually born in 2003 instead of 2002, twins Cody and Colby Niggebrugge and Hindovei Tucker. Salesianum is represented by Nick Balbierer, Alex Krumenacker and Alex Whittaker. There are also two St. Mark’s players – Sean Lenderman and Michael Ranegan.\n\nThe rest of the roster is comprised of Alex Dolce (Unionville, Pennsylvania); Oryem Kilama (Wilmington Friends); Justin Lane (Wilmington Charter); Luke Nall (Kennett, Pennsylvania); Alex Romero (Conrad); Patrick Short (Sussex Tech); and Sam Teigland (Elkton, Maryland).\n\nDespite that wide geographic base, “We’re a really close, tight group, so we all play for each other,” said Short, who has made a rapid comeback from a torn ACL, his second, suffered kicking for Sussex Tech’s football team in its season opener last September at Milford.\n\n“We’re also very emotional,” added Short. “Each and every one of us wants to win. We’ll do whatever it takes to win. And then the team’s just tremendous soccer players, so when you put all three of those together it’s hard to beat us.”\n\nLast year, the team finished third in its league and qualified for the U.S. Club Soccer Elite National Premier League Tournament in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Delaware FC won that, defeating Philadelphia Ukrainian Nationals 02 Boys Black 2-0 in the title game on goals by Short and Cody Niggebrugge. It had beaten teams from Massachusetts, South Carolina and Ohio and tied a Maryland side to reach the final.\n\nLATIN LEAGUE SPROUTS: Union's Fabian visits Kirkwood\n\nThis season has been even better.\n\nIn March in Richmond, Delaware FC captured the prestigious Jefferson Cup’s boys under-17 championship, winning its three games by a combined 6-1 over teams from Ontario, New Jersey and North Carolina.\n\nDelaware FC then finished first in the East Coast Elite National Premier League, ahead of rival Manhattan FC.\n\nThat qualified it for the Elite National Premier League tournament June 28-July 2 near Chicago, where teams vied for spots in the ENPL National Finals July 11-15 at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park. Major League Soccer’s Colorado Rapids play in the main stadium there.\n\nIn Illinois, Delaware FC won group games against the Dallas Texans 2-0 on a pair of goals by Tucker, nipped the OC Surf of California 2-1 on two goals by Short and then handed Discoveries NPL of South Carolina its first defeat in a year on goals by Tucker and Nall.\n\nThat moved it into the championship round, where Short scored 15 seconds into the game and Krumenacker later added the game-winner in a 2-1 victory over northern New Jersey powerhouse Players Development Academy.\n\n“It was really exciting, obviously something all of us wanted to accomplish but to actually do it,” said Short. “We put in the hard work all year so we had lots of emotional victories, but once we won it was super exciting.\"\n\nMATINEE MEN:University of Delaware announces home football kickoff times\n\nAt the National Finals, Delaware FC faces Chicago’s Eclipse Select Thursday, Cleveland-based Impact United Friday and Gwinnett (Georgia) Soccer Academy Sunday in group play. The group winner faces the champion of the other foursome on Monday for the national title.\n\n“It’s like a dream come true for the team and for me,” Tucker said of the team’s trip to Colorado. “I believe we are hoping for the best. We’re gonna play and show what we can do because I know we’re already the best so we’re just going to prove it.”\n\nRepresenting tiny Delaware certainly provides additional motivation for his team, Temple said. But he added that Delaware FC’s success goes beyond soccer skills.\n\n“Just the heart and the competitiveness. They want to be good and they train to be good,” said Temple, a Newark resident who is also an assistant coach at Neumann College in Aston, Pennsylvania.\n\n“One of the unique things about this team is it’s very loose. But when the whistle blows, they’re 100 miles per hour, ready to go.”\n\nSON OF AN EAGLE:Middletown QB never started a high school game, but already has an offer from Alabama\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com and follow on Twitter @kevintresolini.

The data was compiled into a list of the top 150 places known for hospitality and genuine human connection.”\n\nOf the 150 places featured, Delaware’s contribution comes in at No. 149 with Wilmington.\n\nWhile it’s not a quiet suburb or the laid-back beach towns that might usually come to mind when thinking about hospitality in the First State, Wilmington earns its place among the other locations featured. LuvLink cites Wilmington residents as being known for “their approachable and down-to-earth demeanor,” reflecting the city’s blend of big-city energy and small-town charm.\n\nTravelers surveyed said Wilmington locals often help others navigate the city’s food and art scenes, offering tips about the hottest new restaurants and exhibits worth snagging tickets to. Those who have visited the city add that whether you’re downtown, on the Riverfront or somewhere between, city residents are enthusiastic about their area and friendly toward those wanting to maximize their time while passing through.\n\nWhen the travelers surveyed were asked about the most memorable act of kindness they experienced in Delaware, 42% said locals offered them directions or assistance and 25% said that a local helped them during an unexpected situation or emergency.\n\nOverall, 17% of respondents said they were invited to a local event or gathering, and 16% were offered a ride or were personally guided by a local. To illustrate how important hospitality is when booking a trip, the survey revealed that 52% of respondents take it into consideration when planning, and 85% of travelers returned to a destination specifically because of the kindness exhibited and friendships formed during a previous visit.\n\nGetaways for couples:Looking for a place to take a romantic trip?

MERR, a Lewes-based nonprofit, responded to the area and set up a perimeter.

The dunes serve not only as protection for the road but as a delicate ecosystem for wildlife.\n\n\"Delaware Natural Resources Police remind the public that crossing the dune to try and get a better view of the beached whale is prohibited and can result in a fine,\" department spokesman Michael Globetti said in a statement.\n\nHeading to the beach:Travel website's top 20 list includes 2 beach towns in or near Delaware.

Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii. Harris is also African-American.

The primary \"hopefully will bring a lot of people into the process,\" she added, recalling the high number of voters who engaged in a 2008 Democratic primary that featured a possible female nominee, Hillary Clinton, and the man who would become the first black president, Barack Obama.\n\nThe array of backgrounds was on display Wednesday when Buttigieg spoke in personal terms about his marriage.\n\n\"The most important thing in my life — my marriage to Chasten — is something that exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court,\" Buttigieg told reporters. \"So I'm somebody who understands — whether it's through that or whether it's through the fact that I was sent to war on the orders of the president — I understand politics not in terms of who's up and who's down or some of the other things that command the most attention on the news but in terms of everyday impacts on our lives.\"\n\nGillibrand has put her identity as a mother at the core of her campaign, and Harris launched her campaign on this week's Martin Luther King holiday, a nod to her historic bid to become the first black woman elected president.\n\nA number of high-profile candidates remain on the sidelines, including two who would further bolster the diversity of the 2020 field: Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is black, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Booker, who's widely expected to join the presidential fray in the coming days, visited the pivotal early-voting state of South Carolina this week for public events honoring King and private meetings with local activists.\n\nKlobuchar is set to speak at the University of Pennsylvania on Thursday about her work on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Booker and Harris also are members. The affable Midwesterner recently told MSNBC that her family \"is on board\" if she opts to run in 2020, though she's offered little clarity about her timetable to announce a decision.\n\nThough Klobuchar would be the fifth major female candidate in the Democratic primary, female candidates shouldn't be shoehorned into a \"narrative\" dominated by their identity that excludes the policies they're championing, said Virginia Kase, CEO of the League of Women Voters.\n\nKase pushed back at one popular 2018 narrative in a recent interview, noting that \"every year is the year of the woman — the reality is that we've always been major contributors\" in the electoral process.\n\nRashad Robinson, executive director of the civil rights-focused nonprofit Color of Change, said in an interview that the diversity of the Democratic field is \"a great thing and we should celebrate it,\" adding that, \"Our work is always about changing the rules — changing the rules of who can run and who can rule and who can lead is incredibly important.\"\n\nBut in addition to those \"unwritten rules,\" Robinson pointed to the urgency of changing the \"written rules\" of American life, adding that \"diversity alone does not mean structures and policies and practices that have held so many back will change\" overnight.\n\nMeanwhile, three white male candidates who could scramble the race — former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke — are still weighing their own presidential plans. Biden addressed a key vulnerability in his potential candidacy this week by publicly airing regret about his support for a 1994 crime bill that's had particularly negative effects on African-American communities, while Sanders built his own new connections to black voters during a trip to South Carolina.\n\nBiden says he regrets 1990s crime bill, calls it a 'big mistake' at MLK Day event\n\nAs Biden mulls a run for president, his allies have been sending supporters a memo that could serve as a rationale for a campaign. The memo hails Biden's long track record in politics and argues that at a time of \"unprecedented political chaos\" during Trump's administration, Biden would offer \"trustworthy, compassionate leadership.\"\n\nO'Rourke, for his part, continues to gauge his own future amid pundits' criticism about blog posts he published during a recent road trip through multiple states. The 46-year-old Texan acknowledged that he's been \"in and out of a funk\" following his departure from Congress after losing a high-profile Senate race in November, sparking questions about the luxury of his indecision given the family wealth and network of passionate backers he can lean on.\n\nAs the Democratic field is poised to become more diverse, Republicans say Trump will run for re-election based on his record.\n\n\"The American people are better off now than they were two years ago because of President Trump's policies,\" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Blair Ellis. \"GDP and wages are up, unemployment has hit record lows, and industries across this country are thriving. These are the credentials the American voters want from their president and President Trump is the only person who can run on these results.\"\n\n2020 Presidential Campaign:\n\nHere is a rundown of who is running for president in 2020\n\nDelaware Dem leaders support Joe Biden, but is he prepared to lead party progressives?\n\nJoe Biden wrestles with age as he eyes 2020 run", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/04/04/charcoal-pit-plans-to-unveil-a-new-look-and-a-sundae-named-for-ursuline/70041258007/", "title": "Charcoal Pit plans to unveil a new look and a sundae named for ...", "text": "It's a very tricky thing to mess with tradition, especially in Delaware.\n\nThe state's residents tend to be hardcore about change.

Storm chasing tours are popular and can be ...", "text": "Pat Timmons has seen hail the size of baseballs and lighting storms that filled the sky. She faced wind so strong she could barely stand – and multiple tornadoes, too.\n\n“My friends and family think I’m crazy but I’m having the time of my life,” the 76-year-old from West Des Moines, Iowa, said from a roadside stop in Texas where she was on her second storm-chasing trip of the year with Tempest Tours.\n\nTimmons is one of thousands of people from around the world who flock to Tornado Alley to get as close as safety allows to the massive storms that wash across the American countryside from March through June. As climate change warms the atmosphere, the number of storms increases and the crowds are only growing.\n\nThere are over a dozen companies that run storm-chasing tours in the United States, a number that’s increased slowly but steadily over the past few years said Christoffer Björkwall, a Swede who caught the storm chasing bug in 2009 and now runs StormChasingUSA, a website that tracks tour companies.\n\nThat doesn't surprise Alan Fyall, Visit Orlando professor of Tourism Marketing at the University of Central Florida. Adventure tourism has been becoming more popular in the past few decades, and especially in the last ten or 15 years with the rise of social media, he said.\n\n“It’s a bigger market than people appreciate,” Fyall said. “People want the thrill and the adrenaline rush.”\n\nStorm-chasing tours are part of that market. They're not your typical bus tour – no visiting tourist traps for quick photos.\n\nMost tour companies run between one to three small vans with perhaps six people in a van. They seldom have more than 20 guests per trip. The groups drive as far south as Texas and as far north as the Canadian border, chasing images on a radar screen and then patiently waiting for a storm to form.\n\n\"The guys will find us a high place where we can sit for half an hour and we just keep watching and photographing it,\" said Timmons.\n\nCosts vary between $2,000 and $4,500 depending on how long, how luxurious and how many people are on the trip. The season typically lasts from April through August, though May is generally the busiest month.\n\nBjörkwall estimates between a quarter and a third of people who go on these kinds of tours are from outside the U.S.\n\n“This kind of weather only exists in the United States,” he said. Add to that an excellent system of freeways and rural roads, accessible weather data and the endless vistas of the plains – it makes for a perfect recipe.\n\nIt's \"something no other place has.\"\n\nHow safe are storm-chasing tours?\n\nThe National Weather Service is very much not in favor of the public going out in severe weather and would much rather have people stay safely at home.\n\n“The NWS does not encourage anyone to pursue dangerous storms for any reason other than promoting public safety (spotting) and official research,” the agency says in a FAQ about severe weather.\n\nBut the agency acknowledges that despite the dangers, people do. So it cautiously suggests that tours are a better way of doing it. “Joining one of the professional tour groups is probably safer than going out yourself without appropriate training.”\n\nFyall says that's the trick of this kind of extreme travel. “The key with adventure tourism is to make it look as dangerous as possible but at the same time make it as risk-free as possible.\"\n\nTour operators are very clear that while there’s never a guarantee of safety, they do everything they can to keep their clients satisfied but safe, said Roger Hill of Silver Lining Tours based in Denver.\n\n“Any time you’re around a severe thunderstorm, especially a supercell thunderstorm, there’s an inherent risk. You can’t keep anything 100% safe, it’s not possible. That’s why every tour operator has guests sign a waiver saying these are the potential dangers,” he said.\n\nTours offer long and detailed safety information before anyone even sets foot in a van.\n\n“The first night they went over safety and how everything works, down to how to get in and out of the van and who has responsibility for moving the back seat so the last person could get out quickly,” said Samantha Ashby, 33, who took her first storm-chasing tour earlier this month.\n\nAnd unlike in the movies, tours stay well away from the heart of the action. They want a vantage point with a vista, not a target.\n\n“We try to position ourselves a few miles from the storm so we’re out of the way of large hail or lightning. And if a tornado forms, you always have an escape route planned,” Hill said.\n\nIf a storm starts getting too close, they move further away.\n\nThe thrill is not seeing things get destroyed, like in the movies, but to see something so powerful and beyond any human control, said Burns.\n\n\"The best storms for us are out in the middle of nowhere. They’re not going to hurt anything, maybe some fence posts some hay bales. But when it’s right in front of you it makes you feel really insubstantial,” he said.\n\nBut there are dangers. Quite a few years ago, a lightning bolt hit one of his vans, destroying it. But none of the guests were injured because the electricity went through the van and into the ground.\n\nSurprisingly, the guests loved it. “About every one of those guests came back, they said it was so much fun,” he said.\n\nA typical day on a storm-chasing tour\n\nA typical day on one of the tours means driving hundreds of miles. They usually begin around 9 or 10 in the morning, after the tour guides have decided on a likely area for storms.\n\n“The day before our chase we look at the data and make our forecast and then plan our logistics,” said Erik Burns, the owner of Tornadic Expeditions in Whitesboro, Texas.\n\nGetting to the next spot might mean traveling halfway across a state and then setting up to wait for what might come.\n\nTwisters get the press, but many tourgoers say that's not what ends up being the most awe-inspiring.\n\n“We all come to see the tornadoes, but we go home in love with supercells,” said Timmons. These are enormous storms that can reach up to 10 miles in diameter and be 50,000 feet tall, according to the National Severe Storm Laboratory.\n\n“When you get them in late afternoon when the sun lights them up they’re just incredible, they just blossom and grow. Sometimes they’ll be lightning and they get lit up from inside, they cover the sky,” she said.\n\nSomething else she fell in love with was seeing a part of the country most people never see. Despite living in Iowa, the tours have given her a new appreciation for the country.\n\n“It’s just getting to roll down the road and just watch American small towns,” she said. “America is beautiful. We’ve met the kindest people.”\n\nThe danger of traffic\n\nWhile being flattened by a tornado might seem the biggest danger, traffic is more of a threat, say tour leaders.\n\n“The traffic issue has gotten horrible, there’s no question about it,” said Hill. May, which is prime tornado month, is especially bad.\n\n“When we first started running tours in the late ’90s a lot of times there was no one else around. But now if you have a very significant threat area in Oklahoma or Kansas, every storm chaser or storm spotter or local resident is out there chasing. You can get a line of traffic that’s a mile or more long,” he said.\n\n“It can be a little chaotic,” said Björkwall, who’s now been on 11 tours. “I have a friend who was in El Reno, the biggest tornado in the world, and he was stuck and couldn’t get out because there were too many cars on the road.”\n\nBetween social media, radar, weather forecasting and weather-sharing apps, hundreds of people can converge on an area where large storms or tornadoes are anticipated. Tour companies and news crews make up the smallest percentage of the cars on the road at that point, said Björkwall.\n\n“There are thousands and thousands of storm chasers, that number keeps growing every year, everybody comes out on the Plains in May,” said Hill.\n\nThat’s likely to increase this summer with the arrival of a new movie about storm chasing.\n\nNew movie could increase interest\n\nHollywood plays a surprising role in the business of storm chasing.\n\nSilver Lining Tours launched a year after the release of the 1996 movie “Twister,” about a group of storm chasers in Oklahoma.\n\n“We really feel that movie started the storm-chasing industry,” said Hill, who’s been with the company since 2000.\n\nIn July, a new stand-alone sequel, “Twisters” will be hitting theaters and he expects an even greater surge of interest.\n\n“People underestimate the power that the movies have in swaying people’s behavior. It’s a huge driver of tourism,” said Fyall.\n\nIf 1996's \"Twister\" was any indication, tour groups might see a flood of new customers come summer. But it's not clear there will be space for them. There are not that many tour companies and most of them sell out a full year in advance.\n\n\"We’re already 70% filled for next year,\" said Burns of Tornadic Expeditions.\n\nTourists can form bonds while storm-chasing\n\nThe experience was so profound that Ashby just finished a tour the first week in May and has already booked another.\n\nHer group saw eight tornadoes in seven days, which was “incredible and powerful,” said the 911 dispatcher from northern Virginia.\n\n“There were four guests in our van all told and we decided it was so amazing that we all wanted to do it again,” she said.\n\nThe tours for 2025 were already full so they had to schedule for 2026. “I’ve never planned a vacation that for out before,” she said.\n\n“This was four people I’d never met before and now we’re going to spend 10 days together and do it all over again,” she said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/07/01/michael-wardian-runs-across-us-stunning-ultra-running-feat/7765622001/", "title": "Michael Wardian runs across US in stunning ultra-running feat", "text": "LAUREL, Md. — The skinny guy with the scraggly beard jogged north along the shoulder of the highway Tuesday, with the late-afternoon sun beating down on him and six strangers-turned-running-companions just behind.\n\nIt was Day 59, and Michael Wardian had run 44 miles in and around Washington D.C. so far that day — more than 1½ marathons. And he still had about eight miles to go before nightfall.\n\n\"I feel like I was made to do this,\" Wardian said with a grin. \"This is my jam, for sure.\"\n\nThe 48-year-old from Arlington, Virginia, was nearing the end of a Forrest Gump-style feat – something that only the craziest ultra-runners have even attempted.\n\nSince May 1, he had been running the entire length of the United States, primarily on Route 50, with the goal of finishing in 75 days or less. It's a journey that spans 3,234 miles, across 13 states, with more than 132,000 feet in elevation change.\n\nAnd believe it or not, he finished significantly ahead of schedule.\n\nSTAY UP-TO-DATE: Subscribe to our Sports newsletter now!\n\nOn Friday morning, Day 62, Wardian dipped his toes in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Delaware, capping the longest run — and craziest adventure — of his life.\n\n\"I feel like it’s been 59 adventures so far,\" he told a reporter while jogging up Route 1, with a few miles still to go on Day 59.\n\n\"Every day I’m seeing new things, getting to have new experiences.\"\n\nWardian joins a group of fewer than 400 people who are known to have crossed the U.S. on foot, according to Jim McCord, who achieved the feat himself in 2002 and now moderates a Facebook group called USA Crossers. For comparison, that's fewer people than summitted Mount Everest last spring alone.\n\nWardian spent between 11 and 15 hours a day on the move, covering an average of about 52 miles — the equivalent of two marathons — before climbing into an RV for the night.\n\nSometimes, he had company — friends, fellow ultra-runners, weekend joggers who wanted to tag along for a few miles. Most of the time, he was alone. He ran through snow in Colorado, and a heat index of 110 degrees in southern Illinois. He listened to an estimated 35 audiobooks, most at two-times speed. He went through three pairs of Hoka running shoes. He lost at least 12 pounds.\n\n\"It takes a lot of grit,\" said crew chief Eric Belz, who's been driving the RV and supporting Wardian throughout his journey. \"And a lot of passion.\"\n\nA former Michigan State lacrosse player, Wardian is an international ship broker by trade but has become a well-known figure in the ultra-running community over the years. He has run seven marathons on seven continents in seven days, and previously held the world record for fastest marathons on a treadmill and while pushing a stroller.\n\nHe described this transcontinental run (inspired, yes, by Forrest Gump) as a long-held dream — something he'd thought about for decades, but always put off for one reason or another. Then, in 2020, he started dealing with herniated discs in his back and wondered if he'd ever be able to run long distances again.\n\n\"It was really humbling,\" Wardian said. \"You always think you have more time.\"\n\nThe injury, he said, was a spark. With the support of his wife, Jennifer, and their two teenage boys, Wardian connected with Belz, who had previously helped ultramarathoner Karl Meltzer run the Appalachian Trail in record time in 2016.\n\nTogether, they mapped out a route along Route 50, with the expected starting and stopping points for each day. They rented an RV and stocked up on supplies. And Wardian decided to use the trip as a way to raise money for the charitable organization World Vision, helping families around the world get access to clean drinking water. (By Thursday night, he had exceeded his $100,000 goal.)\n\nThen, starting on the steps of city hall in San Francisco on May 1, Wardian hit the road. In a strange twist, his first six miles were actually in the opposite direction, to touch the ocean. He's been running east ever since.\n\n\"It’s been a wild ride,\" said Belz, 44. \"Six miles up the road, where I’m going to crew Mike, I really don’t know what’s up there yet. So it’s just the excitement of: What’s down the road for us?”\n\nOn Day 38, for example, Wardian said he was jogging through western Missouri with a few others when a stray retriever started running alongside them. They called the dog \"Yellow,\" and it joined them for the next 40 miles.\n\nOn Day 46, on the way from Illinois to Indiana, a woman saw Wardian walking alone on the side of the highway and stopped to offer him a ride in her mini-van. He explained that he was running across the country, and politely declined. She then came back a few minutes later, just to be sure. \"I wouldn't tell anyone, (that) I gave you a ride,\" she said.\n\nOn Day 51, Wardian said, someone threw a half-eaten hamburger at him.\n\n\"It missed me and hit the girl I was running with right in the chest,\" he said. \"Yeah, it was pretty gross.\"\n\nWardian admitted he's been discouraged at times by the lack of sidewalks along his route, the drivers who have rolled down their windows to call him an idiot, the truckers who have tried to nudge him off the road.\n\nBut the overwhelming feeling, he said, is gratitude — for those who have joined him along the way, and for the beauty of the country.\n\n\"I’m so Team America right now,\" he said. \"For all the negative stuff, this country is super special. And there’s beauty everywhere.\n\n\"People talk about 'flyover country.' Some of the most beautiful places I saw were in the middle of America, and some of the kindest people.\"\n\nThrough it all, Belz said he's been impressed by Wardian's consistency and good spirits – his frequent desire to add a few more miles to the day, even after he's run 50.\n\nJames Hale, a 42-year-old ultra-runner from Catonsville, Maryland, marveled at the mental fortitude it takes to complete such a trek — on top of all the aches and pains.\n\n\"Even most ultra-runners can’t do this in a day, at his pace,\" said Hale, who joined Wardian for the second half of his run Tuesday. \"He’s sort of that superhuman that can just move.\"\n\nWardian, who lives less than a mile off Route 50 in Arlington, ran through his neighborhood Tuesday morning before continuing on. He said he's already got a few bike races on his schedule, after his run across the country ends — as well as dreams of eventually becoming a professional pickleball player and climbing Mount Everest.\n\nOn this day, though, it was more miles along the side of the highway — north toward Baltimore, then east toward the Atlantic Ocean. He said he's been dealing with \"some pretty big blisters\" in recent weeks, but otherwise felt great.\n\n\"I feel like I could do this every day until the end of time, right now,\" Wardian said.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/09/08/wilmington-pastor-searches-knowledge-streets/71903598/", "title": "Wilmington pastor seeks knowledge on the streets", "text": "Esteban Parra\n\nThe News Journal\n\nWILMINGTON The Rev. Fredrick Allen admits he was nervous and fearful when he walked out of his city home last week to spend a week on the street learning more about the people he serves – the homeless. Yet he quickly realized that he was not nearly as frightened as the hundreds of people here who find themselves without shelter and food.\n\n\"How can I help somebody if I really don't know their struggle,\" asked Allen as he stood outside Wilmington's Friendship House Men's Day Center with other homeless people last week. The 47-year-old nondenominational minister looked tired as he clutched his backpack, four days into his weeklong quest.\n\n\"It a strain out here. I'm physically drained. It beats you up.\"\n\nMost homeless people are willing to help one another, Allen said, and most are willing to share what little food they have. The pastor, who did not identify himself during the weeklong experiment that ended Saturday, said he now understands what the homeless mean when they speak of being exhausted all the time: Because they constantly fear being robbed or attacked, most take only cat naps. Sleep deprivation is a part of life.\n\nThrough his urban ministry, Allen wants to use the new insight gained to speak for the voiceless living on the streets. According to the Homeless Planning Council of Delaware's point-in-time survey, the state's homeless problem has remained steady over the last few years at less than 1,000 people. Last year's count found 950 people experiencing homelessness.\n\n\"I decided I wanted to know exactly what they feel like because giving food to someone is just helping them one day,\" he said. \"We [homeless advocacy groups] see them once a week. We feed them and we think we are doing some good for them.\n\n\"But that's just us feeling great about helping them. They need more help than that. Some of them want to be here, and some of them don't want to be here. Some of them really need help.\"\n\nAllen's method was applauded by some homeless advocates.\n\n\"It's a great idea to be able to have somebody that actually has a little bit of experience to be able to talk about this,\" said Allen Conover, chief executive of the Rick VanStory Resource Center, a drop-in center that offers support for those with psychiatric disorders.\n\nA homeless week recorded on social media\n\nNot only is Allen learning more about this community, but his stories can help teach other providers about a community often shunned by society. Conover said explaining how helpful homeless people are to one another would go a long way to de-stigmatize this population.\n\nDuring his time on the street, several homeless men tried to help him survive, he said. One loaned him water shoes for a mandatory shower at the Sunday Breakfast Mission; another gave him a soda and a lesson on making ends meet. Allen said he cried when a homeless man insisted on sharing his only meal with him.\n\n\"People without houses are the most kindest people I've ever met in my life. It's amazing,\" said Conover, noting that he, too, has witnessed acts of kindness such as a homeless man helping others get socks. \"I've seen that happen on numerous occasions.\"\n\n\"What he did was try to get to the bottom of what people need,\" Conover said.\n\nWhile Allen's journey helped give him insight into what homeless people experience, Cathy McKay, president and chief executive officer of Connections Community Support Programs, said his journey doesn't explain why people are homeless. There are many reasons — including employed people living paycheck-to-paychek who don't have a support system in times of crisis.\n\n\"Sleeping on the street is one thing,\" she said. \"But really understanding that there are people sleeping on the street who are really in bad shape and they need help right away. I don't know for sure that you can replicate that.\"\n\nAllen didn't tell people on the street why he was out there. Instead he talked, listened and observed. And while there were days he almost quit and went home to his comfortable bed, Allen said he was pushed to finish the seven-day quest because he knew others didn't have his option. Without direction, he said, it's easy to feel hopeless.\n\n\"I can just imagine how they must feel because they have to live this every day,\" he said. \"Because there is nothing to do, but wait and wait and just hope that someone will help.\"\n\nSince returning home this week, Allen has begun helping three men he met during his weeklong journey — counseling them on what services that could help them get back on their feet. Allen is helping one man who lost his identification get documents to get Social Security card reissued, and to get a new driver's license.\n\nOnce these men have re-established themselves, Allen wants each of them to go back into the homeless community and help three more people.

Not unlike emotions in the Wood River Valley.\n\nThe past week began with unfettered jubilation at the news May 31 that local boy Bowe Bergdahl, 28, had been released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan after five years. But joy soon turned to shock. Calls and e-mails blasted locals for planning a celebration June 28 for an Army sergeant who may have walked off his post and whose release involved the Obama administration trading five Taliban leaders.\n\nThe party was canceled over safety concerns, and saddened residents went quiet.\n\nOver the weekend, many here and in neighboring Ketchum – principal towns in a rural county the size of Delaware with 22,000 people — declined to share their feelings, concerned that outsiders and even some neighbors might attack.\n\nA number relented, including Bergdahl's former roommate and a key town organizer, to deliver a simple message: Don't judge until the Army completes its inquiry, and let us help a family member come home and heal.\n\n\"All the criticism we've received just makes me more determined (to stand by him),\" says Sherry Horton, who shared a house with Bergdahl for three years — until he decamped for the Army in 2008 — and was his ballet teacher for five years.\n\n\"I don't know what really happened that day (he was captured in 2009), no one does,\" she says. \"Friends make bad decisions. But he's still my friend.\"\n\nJane Drussel wears her weariness with grace. After media published images of her hanging \"Welcome Home Bowe\" signs at her shop, Jane's Artifacts, she started receiving threatening e-mails and calls. As president of the Chamber of Commerce, she decided to send all chamber calls to voicemail.\n\n\"I'm tired, and I'm starting to get a little angry at the negativity,\" she says. \"We're just a small community that cares about those who go out and fight for us. For us to be criticized because we care, that's not right. They're calling our town a traitor town. That's offensive. We are all about family here.\"\n\nAmong the comments on a Bring Bowe Home Facebook page: \"Are you all in Hailey wack-a-doodle? So nice to know an entire town in the United States are (sic) supporting a traitor and deserter.\"\n\nDrussel says that's mild in comparison with what she's seen. In contrast, she points to a bouquet of flowers sent by a family in Texas, along with a note reading, \"I wanted to let you know that there are plenty of us out here who respect Bowe for his service and sacrifice, regardless of the extenuating circumstances ... there is no good reason for people to be so mean and hateful.\"\n\nStrolling the aisles of Jane's Artifacts with her three children is Sherri Ditch, a recent transplant from Seattle. Ditch is visibly upset as she defends her new hometown.\n\n\"Let's say something positive about people who love and support their community members, let's talk about that,\" she says. \"Everyone has each other's back here, and that's not something you see often. It's something special. And until we know what happened (with Bergdahl), people shouldn't be passing judgment.\"\n\nA few streets away, Sondra Van Ert, owner of Baldy Sports, laments how events \"have turned a positive thing into a negative thing. But at least this will be a good place for Bowe to try and reintegrate, a place the world will leave him alone.\"\n\nIn many ways, Hailey feels like an America that lives mostly in memory.\n\nThe main street is called Main Street. Everyone really does know each other's name. At night, stores shutter early, and thrift shops leave their wares out unattended.\n\nTake an evening stroll, and all you hear are the hiss of sprinklers and the wind rustling the leaves on the cottonwood trees. Go for a hike, and you feel like you're the only human on the planet.\n\nWhen bad things happen, such as last year's dangerous Beaver Creek fire, residents rally. When good things happen, such as skier Picabo Street's Olympic triumph in 1998, everyone feels like they were draped with the gold medal.\n\n\"That town is filled with the kindest, most decent people I've ever met,\" says Matt Farwell, who spent time in Hailey and with the Bergdahls while helping Rolling Stone writer Michael Hastings report his 2012 feature, the first to suggest Bergdahl may have walked off his post.\n\n\"These are simply people who love life and love the privilege of living in this country,\" Farwell says. \"And Bowe comes from that.\"\n\nThat tightknit nature explains why the town's 7,000 residents are defensive when it comes to Bob and Jani Bergdahl. It also explains why they're often reluctant to air opinions when there is no place to hide.\n\nSue Martin, long an outspoken Bergdahl supporter, was no longer at her eatery, Zaney's River Street Coffee House, where Bergdahl once worked. A sign on the door refers all media requests to the Blaine County commissioner. Chip Deffe recently told British reporters how Bob Bergdahl, who sometimes works at Deffe's Sun Summit South shop, was a top cyclist who was devastated when his Olympic hopes were dashed by President Jimmy Carter's boycott of the Moscow games in 1980. Now he waves off an interview request with a shake of his head.\n\n\"There's an element of, 'How will my neighbor feel about what I think,' \" says Jason Fry, CEO of the YMCA in Ketchum, down the road from Sun Valley, a resort known for celebrity homeowners such as Tom Hanks and Arnold Schwarzenegger and the annual Allen & Co. confab of business elites.\n\nFry approached a number of military veterans on USA TODAY's behalf, but none wanted to comment. \"One man said, 'I don't think he'll like what I have to say,' \" says Fry, who is very clear on the Bergdahl matter.\n\n\"As a local who has lived with Bowe's absence for five years, it's incredible news that he's coming home,\" he says. \"As for the rest, I consider that a workplace issue between an employee and his employer, the Army.\"\n\nFry concedes that he and his wife developed an early empathy for the Bergdahls. Bob Bergdahl is Fry's UPS driver, and \"when we were pregnant with our first child, it was right about when Bowe was captured, and here he was delivering gifts for our kid. We wondered how that must feel for him.\"\n\nThe Bergdahls, who home-schooled Bowe and his sister Sky outside town, couldn't be reached for comment. Col. Timothy Marsano, who has handled media for the family since 2009, says simply, \"We in the military have no intention of abandoning this family.\"\n\nBergdahl remains at a German U.S. Army outpost undergoing tests and questioning after video footage showed a shaky and thin captive. There is no set date for the soldier to return to Hailey.\n\nWhen he does, \"I'm sure he'll take refuge with his family, who are private people, but I also hope he'll be greeted in town by smiles and a handshake,\" says Larry Schoen, Blaine County commissioner.\n\n\"Like everywhere, I'm sure people here are asking what he did, and did people die looking for him\" as some Army personnel have charged in the wake of Bergdahl's release, he says. \"But in the end, we are a tightknit community. We are a reflection of America at large.\"\n\nGreg Foley, editor of the twice-weekly Idaho Mountain Express, says the Bergdahl story is by far the biggest his paper has covered in decades (most recent headline: \"Hailey cancels Bergdahl celebration in face of political firestorm\").\n\n\"Over the five years, there's been a lot of support in this valley for the Bergdahls, from ribbons to motorcycle rallies,\" he says. \"Before the release, there was 100% unity, but now that's changed a bit. I'd say the story continues to evolve. What's very clear, though, is that for the Bergdahls this is the beginning of the road, not the end.\"\n\nIndeed, this tumultuous week and its attendant passions and even vitriol will soon pass. Residents are looking to that next chapter.\n\n\"I think this town will be fine, I just hope Bowe is, too,\" says Sally Kern who, when she isn't raising golden retriever puppies, is busy sewing wind socks at her in-home shop, Kernworks. A sign on the door urges customers to take anything they like and simply leave a check or cash in her mail slot.\n\n\"I hope Bowe can shoulder this re-entry,\" she says softly. \"To be captive is one thing. To have a lot of America turn against you, that's hard to handle.\"\n\nSome time back, a Wood River Valley regular wrote a short story about a young enlisted man coming back from an overseas conflict and his attempts to pick up his life: \"He had tried to keep his life from being complicated. … He wanted his life to go smoothly. It had just gotten going that way. Well, that was all over now, anyway.\"\n\nWhen Ernest Hemingway wrote that passage in Soldier's Home in 1925, he was beginning to explore the scars of war and its aftermath. Much like this soldier's home.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/08"}]}

He read every label, especially in the cookie aisle. He would compare one product against another, patiently taking the time to explain to us the benefits of some and the detriments of others. As he would show us that cocoa in this cookie is not real chocolate or the oil in this item is superior to that item — we would sometimes respond with the ever obnoxious and timeless eye roll that he always would catch out of the corner of his eye. Growing up, our family stayed away from this brand or that as they were deemed \"the enemy\" - for reasons of competition or poor ingredients. It would take what seemed like hours to just pick up a short list.\n\nFor my dad, now retired, it's still a fun adventure to head to the grocery store, peruse the aisles and see what's new in the land of labels. The irony - or perhaps sweet justice - is now, there I am with him. I have become an avid ingredient checker. I am my father's daughter.\n\nAs I have decided to head into the world of natural living because of a preservative sensitivity, labels on foods, medicine and other products loom even larger. I used to look at them for calorie, sodium and carbohydrate content. I even checked out the ingredients for food allergy reasons. But, I glossed over the words I couldn't quite pronounce - the ones I knew were not from the earth, but man-made. They didn't really matter right? All that has changed.\n\nJust a day or two into our preservative-free journey, my daughter Rebekah and I took a ride to Whole Foods Market in Marlboro. New to really reading labels for preservatives (we always looked them over for allergy reasons), we spent more than three hours touring the store under the tutelage of Jill Rizzi, the healthy eating and cultural demonstration specialist at the Whole Foods Market. Long after my eyes were crossing from the confusion of which \"ite\" was what, Jill continued to read every label on every item we picked up. Not just looking for preservatives, she took the time to understand more.\n\nBoth Bekah and I have food allergies – tree nuts, pineapple and coconut. (No, I have never had a pina coloda). I have other food allergies – strawberries, apples, peaches, pears, plums (Yes, healthy is not easy!) and Bekah is lactose intolerant. We are now Jill's biggest cheerleaders. This was an amazing personalized free-of-charge service that I did not expect. When we asked if we were taking up too much of her time, she responded that this was her job. Everyone in every department that Jill introduced us to and we spoke to were gracious and knowledgeable. In this day and age of \"too busy, go ask someone else\" it really was a welcome and almost out-of-body experience. Who grocery shops happy? It's usually a more cranky, \"I don't want to be here\" experience. We were smiling and I was almost giddy.\n\nAs we got to the produce aisle, Jill explained that there are certain items where the organic title matters most. She called them the \"dirty dozen,\" and they included celery, peaches, strawberries, apples, domestic blueberries, nectarines, sweet bell peppers, spinach (kale and collard greens), cherries, potatoes, imported grapes and lettuce. Some of these we bought fresh and others we bought frozen. Some we didn't buy at all. (Don't like celery!)\n\nFor our use, she stressed that anything else we intend to use the rind or skin on, such as lemons or potatoes, should definitely be organic. Thanks to a Martha Stewart suggestion, Bekah and I like to drink lemon water every day. Full of Vitamin C, It is high in antioxidants and is considered an excellent immune booster. (And who can't use a little immune boosting!)\n\nThis Dirty Dozen list, and another called the Clean 15, were compiled using data from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on the amount of pesticide residue found in non-organic fruits and vegetables after they had been washed.\n\nJill also explained that organic is the easiest way to go. Items labeled organic means that the foods and products have been grown and processed in a particular manner. They must meet certain requirements in order to be certified and labeled as organic. Simply, they must be farmed in safe soil, have no modifications, no synthetic pesticides may be used and be separated from conventional products. There are also rules for livestock with regards to the animals' feed - must be organic - prohibition of antibiotics, growth hormones or animal by-products and they must have access to outdoors. Another key is that organic items do not use chemical preservatives in them.\n\nWe were cautioned that labels should always be checked. Lots of organic products use almonds or coconut in their content. While it may be \"healthy\" for many, for us, not so much. There are also many products out there that also do not use preservatives and use organic ingredients, but due to the expense of organic certification, cannot label themselves \"organic.\"\n\nSo, we filled the cart with our pantry staples to get us started. I haven't replaced everything yet, but the main categories have gotten their overhaul. Next up is spices and more in the meat department. While our Whole Foods mentor Jill is vegan, we are not headed down that road. Fish, poultry and some beef is still on our menu.\n\nSo, I spent my paycheck at Whole Foods Market. Seriously, I was more than pleased with the prices for what I needed. I had been warned by many that I would find \"going organic\" expensive, but for what I got – a newly stocked pantry – it was not. And it wasn't my whole paycheck… maybe more than I originally thought, but I'll actually remember my coupons next time. (They like to stay perched on my kitchen table while I shop.) Whole Foods also had a booklet of coupons and specials for its customers.\n\nAnd back to expense, it really was not. Though choosing the organic label can be more than the non-organic, it did not double our bill. While it wasn't pennies more, I'd say the difference for most items was still well under the dollar amount per item. And we stocked up on Whole Foods own \"365\" brand, most of which also came in an organic option. I also restocked an entire pantry, something that will not happen every visit.\n\nI also send an apology to anyone in the aisles with me. I'm probably standing in your way reading labels. Until I get the hang of this, I'm that slow poke looking slightly confused, muttering and googling on her iPhone while squinting at the side of a package. If you see me, stop and say hi. I'm there for the duration.\n\nCheck out the Whole Foods Market website at www.wholefoodsmarket.com. You will find the latest coupons for your particular Whole Foods of choice at http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/coupons and can print them directly from the website. You can always pick up a booklet at a store as well.\n\nHave questions for Jill? She can be found at Jill.Rizzi@WholeFoods.com. She also hosts a variety of classes and events every month with topics concerning healthy eating, fitness and natural living. You think they will let me move in there?\n\nAnd by the way, thanks dad. If it wasn't for you trying to teach us the art of label reading all these years, I probably would give up. Your lessons stuck. (And not just the ones in the grocery aisle.) I'm proud to join the ranks of the ingredient checker army and your grandchildren are enlisting as well. Without eye-rolls and heavy sighs.

At least not to the nearly 1,000 people who annual drop by for take-out or pull up a chair inside.\n\nChicken soup with matzo balls, noodle kugel, carrot tzimmes, brisket, potato knishes histories that stretch back centuries and echo from an ocean away.\n\nThe bazaar, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. March 30, includes traditional Jewish food, deli sandwiches, casseroles, gourmet desserts, a silent auction, white elephant sale and a raffle. Work starts each January with group cooks to supply the freeze-well dishes that'll supply the hot plate line and frozen casserole stash. The Sisterhood's largest fundraiser of the year, it supports service programs and groups such as Stewpot, Henry S. Jacobs camp, Meals on Wheels, Salvation Army and more. And it's a temple-wide effort; the Men's Club rallies to the occasion, frying up the popular blintzes on bazaar day.\n\nLunch time typically sees the biggest rush, with eat-in and carry-out orders snapping up many Jewish cultural staples.\n\nDifferent families have different traditions as far as the meals go, said Cheryl Katz, co-president with Mindy Humphrey of the Beth Israel Sisterhood. \"Everybody's stuffed cabbage is different.\" And so, recipes for the bazaar foods that feed the masses may change a bit, too, as committee chairmanships pass from one person to the next. 'Sometimes they tweak it to what their family is eating.\"\n\nThe menu touches on foods from traditions ranging from Eastern Europe to Israel (hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbouli, chopped liver) to New York delis (reuben, corned beef), to satisfy a wide range of preferences.\n\nBut the taster plate on the hot food line may be a greatest hits collection. Here's the back story on its cultural staples:\n\nKugel, rooted in Eastern Europe's Ashkenazi Jews, may have a history stretching back more than eight centuries and can be a dessert or savory side depending on the style. Early on, before sugar sweetened the landscape and for the vast majority of regular folk, kugel was a baked pudding. Noodles, eggs, cheese and/or milk joined the dish via German Jews, rendering a creamy casserole. Potatoes or matzo flour might form the base rather than noodles, with vegetables and onions added for extra flavor. But no meat (mixing meat with milk wasn't kosher).\n\nSugar sweetened it up it up in the 1600s, and fruit such as raisins became common in sweet kugel, which has outdistanced its savory older cousin in popularity. The sweet noodle kugel — rich with dairy, sweetened with raisins, its crunchy top a pleasant contrast to the yielding custardy pasta — is a specialty at the bazaar.\n\nStuffed cabbage — cooked cabbage leaves wrapped around fillings, usually beef and rice — stretch back about 2,000 years in Jewish cooking, with recipes and preferences among European Jews varying by region.\n\nPotato knishes trace roots, too, back to Eastern European Jewish heritage, immigrants in the early 20th century popularized this staple/snack food in New York City. Simple, fast and filling, the pastry-covered knishes could be spicy or sweet. At a deli, the pastry-covered knish can be about the size of a bagel; at the bazaar, petite-sized potato knishes fit on the taster plate or qualify as appetizers.\n\nTzimmes, a traditional sweet stew of simmered carrots and dried fruits such as raisins and/or prunes (and often with other root vegetables), hails from Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, with honey or sugar, orange juice and occasionally cinnamon or other spices adding even more flavor. Because of all the prep work hat goes into slicing and stirring, the name may claim parentage in Yiddish tzim (for) and esn (eating); the expression \"make a big tzimmes over something,\" means making a big fuss, according to unitedwithisrael.org.\n\nBrisket, the flavorful cut of beef from the cow's chest, is best braised to bypass its tough and stringy tendencies. The ease, time involved and better-the-next-day qualities made it a reliable and traditional staple for big meals, from Rosh Hashana to Passover.\n\nChicken soup with matzo balls — sometimes referred to as \"Jewish penicillin\" for its curative powers — includes a dumpling made of matzo meal with eggs, water and oil or chicken fat (schmaltz).\n\nBlintzes hark back to Hungarian origin, and the creamy cheese filling of the crepes is sometimes augmented with jam or sour cream for an even sweeter, richer treat.\n\nThe Beth Isreal Bazaar \"is probably one of the oldest, in relative terms, and beloved Jewish food festivals in the South,\" said Marcie Cohen Ferris, author of \"Matzoh Ball Gumbo: Culinary Tales of the Jewish South.\" \"Beth Israel has really made a name for themselves, particularly because it's in Mississippi.\" Ask American Jews to name the most surprising place Jews live, \"it's Alaska and Mississippi,\" she said.\n\n\"To have a really vibrant, well-established Jewish food festival/bazaar that's meant so much for so long ... is really significant. It has really strong meaning particularly in Jackson because it was a way for that Jewish community to say we are here. We are committed to this state. We are Mississippians, but we have these cherished religious and ethnic food traditions. And it's important to us, like other church folks, to share this with you.\n\n\"That's what people do in the South and at churches and synagogues,\" with bazaars, festivals and cake sales.\n\n\"It's exotic, but it's familiar because people know those Jewish community members.\"\n\nKatz said, \"It's a Jackson tradition now.\"\n\nContact Sherry Lucas at slucas@gannett.com or (601) 961-7283.

Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nMORE MAKING WEIGHT: Current updates to this blog are here\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016\n\nRedefining health\n\nThank you to everyone who turned out earlier this month for our Making Weight event at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines.\n\nIt was a wonderful evening of conversation between myself, members of my medical team and readers who’ve followed this journey for more than a year.\n\nWe spent most of the session answering questions from the audience. It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/iowa-mourns/2020/10/12/coronavirus-covid-deaths-in-iowa-lives-remembered/3477467001/", "title": "These are the names of more than 800 of the Iowans who have died ...", "text": "The numbers associated with Iowa’s coronavirus pandemic come regularly. They appear in our inboxes and on our feeds like clockwork, sandwiched between big box store discounts and emails from friends.\n\n4,706 positive cases one day.\n\n40 deaths another.\n\nOver 400,000 recovered to date.\n\nMore than 6,100 lost.\n\nIn the routine of it all a callus grows, a protection against what these numbers actually stand for — people.\n\nBehind these figures are storytellers and hard workers, Cubs fans and pie bakers, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. Behind these numbers are our fellow Iowans.\n\nThe Iowa Mourns project is a result of months of research to reveal the stories of neighbors and friends lost to the pandemic. In writing about them, we focused on the light of their lives instead of the darkness of their diagnoses, and sought to chronicle who they were, what they did and how they’ll be remembered.\n\nIowa Mourns was made possible by an unprecedented partnership of nine daily newspapers across Iowa’s two premier newspaper organizations — the Register, Ames Tribune, Burlington Hawk Eye and Iowa City Press-Citizen of the USA TODAY Network; and the Council Bluffs Daily Nonpareil, Mason City Globe Gazette, Quad-City Times, Sioux City Journal and Waterloo Courier of Lee Enterprises. Journalists from all over the state contributed, ensuring we painted a true picture of how Iowa has changed from river to river.\n\nWe remain committed to telling these stories. If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

Our seven days on the road showed us that the 50th anniversary edition of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will have more variety of scenery, history and people than perhaps any other in RAGBRAI history, and some of the most memorable stops.\n\nIt will begin six weeks from Sunday in Sioux City, Iowa's westernmost metro area, on the Missouri River, where long before it stood, Lewis and Clark journeyed through and left behind the remains of the only member of their crew to die on their epic journey to the Pacific. The grave of Sgt. Charles Floyd, who succumbed to appendicitis, is marked with a sandstone obelisk on a high bluff over the river valley.\n\nAs they journeyed up the river, the explorers encountered more than 50 indigenous tribes, including the Sioux for whom the city and its Big Sioux River are named. Siouxland, as the Iowa-Nebraska-South Dakota tristate is known, is still home to members of the Omaha, Winnebago and Ponca tribes.\n\nSioux City also has one of Iowa's highest proportions of Latino population, rivaling the first overnight town, Storm Lake.\n\nIn addition, the ride will overnight in or around Iowa's two largest college towns, Ames, home of Iowa State University, and Coralville, part of the Iowa City metro, which the University of Iowa calls home. Both schools draw students from around the globe. And of course, it will stop in Des Moines, which has been welcoming refugees from places as varied as Laos, Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bhutan and most recently, Afghanistan, for almost as long as RAGBRAI has been around.\n\nEven the smallest overnight city on the route, the combined area of Tama and Toledo, with a collective 5,400 people, has a significant indigenous population whose history reflects their determination to remain in Iowa despite the efforts of early white settlers to relocate them to a Kansas reservation.\n\nAs a Latino citizen of rural Iowa, Ro Rosario, 53, who is leading an effort by South Tama High School to decorate Tama-Toledo for RAGBRAI, has experienced the sting of not being wanted in certain places because of his heritage. But he said Tama-Toledo is a diverse town that he's confident will wrap its arms around the international crowd.\n\n\"It's a warm welcome,\" Rosario said.\n\nDay 7 pass-through town West Jefferson is another small city with surprising diversity, part of Muscatine County, where people of Hispanic heritage make up almost of fifth of the total population. Charles Brooke, head of the West Jefferson RAGBRAI organizing committee, said the 50th anniversary ride will showcase the varies communities that make up Iowa in a way no previous ride has.\n\n\"From Sioux City all the way to Davebnport, we're hitting everything,\" Brooke said.\n\nCan't wait to see you in July!\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n11:30 a.m. Saturday\n\nDown by the river\n\nRAGBRAI route inspection riders have reached the Mississippi River at Muscatine. Usually, that means the ride is over, or soon will be. But the 50th anniversary edition of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will be different.\n\nMuscatine has been the ending town for RAGBRAI six times: 1976, 1986, 1995, 2001, 2006 and 2016. But for the first time it will be a pass-through town on the final day, July 29. Instead, riders will enjoy 27 miles of riverside scenery on their way to end point in Davenport ― which also was the finishing line for the initial ride in 1973.\n\nRide director Matt Phippen said previously that he wanted riders to experience the ride along the Mississippi from Muscatine through Buffalo, inspired by a similar, though shorter, route along the river into the 2022 ending town of Lansing. Aside from the scenery, it has this going for it: It's flat.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n9:30 a.m. Saturday\n\nKinnick takes its turn\n\nOn Day 3 the RAGBRAI route inspection team took a lap around the track inside Jack Trice Stadium as we rode into the overnight town of Ames. It'll be repeated when the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa's 50th anniversary edition reaches the home of Iowa State University on July 25, something the ride did for the first time when it visited Ames in 2018.\n\nAnything you do at least twice is a tradition, right?\n\nThe University of Iowa is determined not to be outdone by its cross-state rival when it comes to rituals, even though there isn't a track inside Kinnick Stadium. So as the ride wound through campus Saturday morning on the way to downtown Iowa City, the concourse gates came open and we passed through the stadium's interior, pausing at an opening for a view of the field below.\n\n\"The best view in Iowa,\" ride director Matt Phippen quipped as the Hawkeyes fight song played over the loudspeakers.\n\nIt'll happen again as RAGBRAI comes through on Day 7, July 29, so Hawkeyes be warned: Don't pack away your black and gold after College Jersey Day on July 28.\n\nJoshua Schamberger, president of the Think Iowa City convention and visitors bureau, said he'd been thinking about a Kinnick visit since making the Trice lap with Phippen on the 2018 route inspection ride, when Phippen was a RAGBRAI volunteer and manager of the bike department at the Coralville Scheel's store.\n\n\"Matt and I were the first two to ride through (Trice) on the pre-ride,\" Schamberger recalled. \"Matt's working at Scheel's at the time and he's like, \"Is there any way you could pull that off?'\"\n\nIt didn't happen in 2018, even though Iowa City was on the route. But with five years to work on it, Schamberger said the university is ready. It'll be a classic moment on a classic ride.\n\nThe riders entered Kinnick on the south concourse next to the Nile Kinnick statue. Then they proceeded to the opening on the southwest corner, where they could get their photos taken with the field in the background, then departed through the west concourse.\n\nOn RAGBRAI, \"It'll be a little slow in the morning because people will want to take in the experience, but it'll all work out,\" Schamberger said.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n6 a.m. Saturday\n\nOn the homestretch\n\nIt’s been a good week. But it’s been a long week. So as always at the end of a RAGBRAI ride, we’re all more than ready to dip a tire in the Mississippi, take a bow and head for our own beds. But there’s still one more segment to go, one more set of irreplaceable experiences to be logged into our memories. So off we go from Coralville through the University of Iowa, downtown Iowa City and on to Muscatine and then a blessedly flat riverside ride to Davenport.\n\nSome of us on the inspection ride will be back to in July, when the 50th anniversary Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa once again takes us from river to river across this beautiful state. Thanks from coming along!\n\nToday’s route\n\nCoralville to Davenport\n\nMiles: 66\n\nClimb: 1,604 feet\n\nMeeting town: Muscatine\n\nPass-through towns: Iowa City, West Liberty, Buffalo\n\nWhat to know: It was only about six weeks ago that the Mississippi was in a historic flood, cresting at nearly 22 feet in the Quad Cities. Parts of today’s route, designed to give riders a nice, long look at the river, were underwater, and so was the tire dip site at Veterans Memorial Park in Davenport. This morning’s river stage is expected to be 6 feet, a reminder of just how changeable the continent’s mightiest river can be. Hope for sufficient rain this summer to keep the corn green, but also just enough to keep the river within its banks.\n\nDAY 6\n\n5 p.m. Friday\n\nCoralville at last\n\nCyclists on the RAGBRAI 50th anniversary route inspection team ended the sixth day of their test ride across Iowa in Coralville shortly after 5 p.m. at the Coralville Recreational Center, which sits in the northernmost part of RAGBRAI’s planned July 28 campsite, S.T. Morrison Park.\n\nSome local officials, organizations and members of the community were in attendance to welcome the riders into town as they arrived well ahead of schedule. The crew celebrated the completion of another day by drinking chocolate milk and posing for pictures with a surprise guest — Herky the Hawk — who appeared from the rec center as they rolled up. Several had donned their University of Iowa biking jerseys in anticipation of the day's final destination.\n\nKylee Stock of Think Iowa City was among the welcoming party. She said she has memories of RAGBRAI coming through Cedar Rapids, her hometown, many times when she was younger.\n\n“It’s great that we can welcome such a big event to town,” Stock said.\n\nRAGBRAI will wend its way through the University of Iowa campus and downtown Iowa City on the early morning on its final day, July 29.\n\n“It feels pretty special that they chose Coralville as an overnight town for their 50th anniversary,” Stock added.\n\nMembers of the local government were also in attendance to welcome riders. Laurie Goodrich, who is a member of Coralville City Council, was there with her husband Jim, a RAGBRAI veteran.\n\n“It’s very exciting,” Goodrich said. “The team that’s working to bring this to Coralville is working really hard.”\n\nThe route inspection riders weren't quite done. Like a lot of riders in July who are expected to take advantage of the Iowa City metro's abundant hotel choices, they left the park for a 2-mile pedal west to their accommodations at the Iowa River Landing, where they will spend their final night on the ride.\n\nThey were previously scheduled to visit Backpocket Brewing there to sample the beer the business is brewing in commemoration of the city’s 150th anniversary, which also is this year, but those plans were canceled, Coralville Mayor Meghann Foster told the Press-Citizen earlier Friday.\n\n― Ryan Hansen\n\n3 p.m. Friday\n\nVolunteers needed in Coralville\n\nAwaiting the arrival of the RAGBRAI route inspection team, Coralville Mayor Meghann Foster spoke about the excitement of city residents when the ride announced Coralville as an overnight town for the sixth time. It was last selected as an overnight town in 2015.\n\n“The very evening that Coralville was announced as an overnight town, I began receiving emails from the community asking how folks could help, how folks could pitch in,” Foster said. “A lot of these are residents that have lived in our community for long enough to remember ... all the other times RAGBRAI has come through, so they're excited.”\n\nThe city is looking for 900 volunteers for the event, Foster said.\n\nS.T. Morrison park, which includes a water park, small baseball field and playground, will be the campground, hosting more than 25,000 riders. Additional open green space is available next to adjacent Northwest Middle and Kirkland Elementary schools.\n\nEven more people are expected to flock to the park to meet family and friends and take in a free performance from the band Bush.\n\n“This truly is an opportunity for us to showcase our community to people from all over the nation and actually across the globe,” Foster said. “We know that there are people that come from other countries to participate in RAGBRAI and we are really proud of our community and everything that we have to offer.”\n\n1 p.m. Friday\n\nWillkommen to Amana\n\nRAGBRAI's route inspection team arrived in Amana just before 1 p.m., more than an hour ahead of schedule, as they continued scouting and finalizing the route that more than 28,000 riders will navigate in July.\n\nAmana has not been a part of RAGBRAI's route since 1991, meaning even some of the most dedicated veteran riders will have never gone through one of Iowa's most acclaimed tourist spot, founded along with a cluster of other villages ― the Amana Colonies ― by a German communal religious group in the 19th century.\n\nWhile only 388 people live in Amana, the town attracts throngs of visitors throughout the year. The seven villages within the colonies were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1967, and the colonies' website touts them as a place where \"the past is cherished and hospitality is a way of life.\"\n\nAmana has the admiration of its rivals, including the ride's ultimate destination today, Coralville.\n\n“This town has very hospitable folks,” Kelly Hayworth, Coralville’s city administrator, told the Iowa City Press-Citizen. “The colonies are awesome. There’s lots to see and do here and riders, they are going to be really surprised.”\n\nThose along on the test ride sat in the shade and took in the Old World feel of Amana, including snapping a photograph in front of the Festhalle Barn, a historic event space, before continuing down Route 151 enroute to Oxford. They're running about half an hour ahead of schedule today as they depart, just after 2 p.m.\n\n― Ryan Hansen\n\nWhat's ahead on Day 6\n\n6 a.m. Friday\n\nIt’s the penultimate day, a big one concluding in Coralville, part of the Iowa City metro area. It’s another long journey after the ride’s longest day Thursday, but with some great stops along the way. We’re especially looking forward to the Amana colonies, seven towns that once were part of a German-immigrant religious commune. They all have their appeal, but the most tourist-friendly is the pass-through town of Amana, with German restaurants and bakeries; Millstream, Iowa’s oldest craft brewery; a smokehouse; a woolen mill; a history museum; and a National Park Service office. It’s one of Iowa’s true tourism gems, and it seems a bit of a mystery as to why it’s only been on the RAGBRAI route twice before, in 1991 as an overnight town and in 1976 as a pass-through town.\n\nToday’s route\n\nTama-Toledo to Coralville\n\nMiles: 82\n\nClimb: 3,303 feet\n\nMeeting town: Marengo\n\nPass-through towns: Chelsea, Belle Plaine, Amana and Oxford\n\nWhat to know: It’s no secret that RAGBRAI likes its classic rock. That’s reflected in the musical lineup for this year’s ride, which includes Lynyrd Skynyrd in Des Moines, whose peak era ended with a tragic airplane crash in 1977, and Foghat in Tama-Toledo, which had its biggest hit, “Slow Ride,” in 1975. So the featured band in Coralville on July 28, Bush, will represent something of a departure. A post-grunge band, its biggest hit was “Glycerine” in 1994, and it released a record as recently as 2022. That seems appropriate for a metro area that has one of the youngest populations per capita, with a median age of just over 26.\n\nDAY 5\n\n6 p.m. Thursday\n\nHills a poppin' on Des Moines-to-Tama-Toledo route\n\nFor those on the RAGBRAI 50th anniversary route inspection ride, Thursday's Day 5 journey was both the longest and most scenic yet.\n\nIn over 4,000 feet of climb over nearly 87 miles between Water Works Park in Des Moines and the overnight stop of Tama-Toledo, we saw some of the most spectacular greenery that Iowa has to offer.\n\nThe elevation gain was the most of the ride, but it wasn't the killer it appeared to be on paper. Leaving Des Moines we climbed a steep hill near the Iowa State Fairgrounds and up a few other sizable hills. A two-mile stretch halfway between Kellogg and Grinnell has two climbs of about one mile in length. The hilliest section comes near the end of a long day about midway between Grinnell and the overnight stop, Tama-Toledo.\n\nMost of the other hills are rolling, which even with strong crosswinds can be conquered without maximum effort. Six miles of downhills and flatlands greet riders as they roll into Tama County. So while July 27 could be the toughest day of the week on RAGBRAI, it also may be the most rewarding.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n12:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nOut for a slide\n\nRiding a road bike on gravel is not easy. But wading through a creek, carrying a bike, is harder.\n\nSo riders on Day 5 of this year's Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will take a 2.5-mile detour on an unpaved road to get to the pass-through town of Colfax. That's because a bridge on County Road F-48 over Squaw Creek is out.\n\nIt's not an unprecedented situation. Over its 50 years, RAGBRAI occasionally has been routed onto gravel roads when paved roads were blocked and alternatives would be too dangerous for cyclists.\n\nRide director Matt Phippen said that without using the stretch of gravel, RAGBRAI would not be able to visit Colfax, which signed on to be a pass-through town before it was apparent the bridge would be closed for repairs this summer.\n\nIn 2022, bridge construction between Wesley and Hutchins forced riders to walk their bikes along a short dirt road used by construction vehicles. In Colfax’s case, that wasn't possible, Phippen said.\n\nHe said organizers will make every effort to ensure the gravel stretch is navigable for all kinds of bikes. As in 2002, when riders had to travel a 2-mile stretch of gravel, Phippen said, ride organizers will seek to ensure any gravel is either scraped off the road or hard-packed.\n\n“We’re going to work with the county,\" he said. \"They’re going to help scrape it off. It’s not terrible, but it’s 2 miles. Those 2 miles will get riders into a town that is super excited to have RAGBRAI riders.”\n\nPersonally, on Thursday’s RAGBRAI route inspection ride, I felt terrified riding the gravel surface on my road bike's skinny, high-pressure tires, my riding shoes clipped onto my pedals. Even riders on gravel bikes, when on pavement, point out spots of loose gravel to one another so nobody hits it unaware and slides out of control.\n\nThe unscraped portion where I first encountered the gravel after leaving the pavement was a reminder of that hazard. It was dusty, and the stones felt loose and slippery.\n\nBut further along we came to scraped portions, which felt like a solid, if bumpy, road. Still, I treaded like a scared cat, going 6-8 mph as compared to my usual 20-plus. At my fastest I only reached 12 mph, and that was to get out of the way of a semi-trailer as I passed another rider.\n\nThen came a sight that made my blood run cold: a hill. I imagined losing traction with my treadless tires and ending up sideways, scraped and bloody.\n\nIt turned out to be surprisingly easy. Something had scraped the loose rocks away and it felt less bumpy than portions of Des Moines’ Neal Smith Trail, which we rode Wednesday on our way into the city.\n\nBut what goes up must come down. With pavement finally in sight, riders had to navigate a small downhill section of loose gravel. Rounding a short turn, I started on the right-hand corner of the road and found myself on stopping out of control on the lefthand corner, only a few feet from the tarmac\n\nIt could have been worse. On the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride, the initial 1973 cross-Iowa journey that evolved into RAGBRAI, route planning was haphazard. One of the 120 people who finished that trip, Stephen Gaul of Slater, said riders encountered unexpected road closures that forced them onto extensive sections of gravel. And he was riding a French road bike weighed down with all of his gear for the week.\n\n“There’s a couple places where we had to take some gravel because a bridge was out or they were preparing a bridge and didn’t tell them about it,” Gaul said.\n\nAnd in 1994, RAGBRAI took riders on 14 miles of gravel over four days.\n\nTake the advice of late RAGBRAI Co-Founder John Karras, who wrote of gravel riding in 1994, “Maintain a steady pace, rest your hands lightly on the tops of the handlebars and let the front wheel find its way through the gravel.”\n\nPhippen acknowledged that the gravel is “pretty difficult to ride” for those who don't have specially adapted bikes.\n\n“You’re riding on loose rocks. So if you lose focus for one second, hit a big rock, you’re tired and you could go down,” he said.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n7:30 a.m. Thursday\n\nPaying tribute to the founders\n\nAfter spending Wednesday night in Des Moines, riders on the inspection of the 50th anniversary RAGBRAI route began Thursday morning with a visit to the sculpture honoring late ride founders John Karras and Donald Kaul in Water Works Park, where the tens of thousands of riders coming through the city on July 26 will camp.\n\nKaul died in 2018 and Karras in 2021. The $200,000 bronze and aluminum installation depicts the pair of Register journalists with their bikes, initiating the annual Missouri River tire dip that is now a ritual part of the start of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nAn inscription lists the 133 towns and cities across Iowa that had hosted riders before 2021, and credits Karras and Kaul with putting \"the world's largest, longest and oldest recreational bicycle touring event\" on \"every enthusiastic bicyclist's bucket list.\"\n\nAfter paying their respects, the riders mounted up and got under way on their journey to the first pass-through town of the day, Altoona. The ride also passes through Pleasant Hill on the way there, but with the most miles of any day to cover ― almost 87 ― ride director Matt Phippen said the decision was made to keep the riders moving, foregoing a stop there.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n6 a.m. Thursday\n\nRAGBRAI riders who stay up late to party Wednesday night in Des Moines may regret it: The route we’ll be following today will likely be one of the most challenging of the ride. It starts with an occasionally steep ascent out of the Des Moines River valley to Altoona, the breakfast stop, then follows plenty more bumpy terrain. Most of the hills aren’t as steep or long as some of those on Day 1, when the route climbs out of the Missouri River valley. But it adds up to the most feet of climb for any day of the ride, as well as the most mileage.\n\nThe overnight destination is the smallest on the route: the twin cities of Tama-Toledo, combined population 5,400. It’s not one of the stops from the original 1973 route, but the equivalent overnight on that year’s six-day ride was the even smaller Williamsburg. Still, the Tama-Toledo RAGBRAI campground is well-situated, near a commercial hub between the two cities that includes a supermarket, several convenience stores and cluster of restaurants.\n\nToday’s route\n\nDes Moines to Tama-Toledo\n\nMiles: 86.8\n\nClimb: 4,140 feet\n\nMeeting town: Newton\n\nPass-through towns: Altoona, Mitchellville, Colfax, Kellogg and Grinnell\n\nWhat to know: A few miles east of Tama-Toledo is the Meskwaki Settlement of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi in Iowa. The Meskwaki were among indigenous groups forced out of Iowa to a Kansas reservation in the 1840s, but some stayed behind and others eventually returned. Over time, they acquired the land for the village, one of the most significant representations of native people remaining in Iowa. It includes a cultural center and museum and a casino hotel.\n\n12:50 p.m. Wednesday\n\nArriving in Des Moines\n\nA hot day for riders on the RAGBRAI route inspection team briefly turned cool Wednesday, with light rain falling as they rode into Ankeny with a police escort.\n\nThe main stop was a pizza and beer lunch at Uptown Garage Brewing, where they were impressed by the spacious adaption of a former auto shop.\n\nThe actual RAGBRAI ride is supposed to proceed from Ankeny to Des Moines on July 26 via U.S. 69, known as Ankeny Boulevard in Ankeny and East 14th Street in Des Moines. But without the Iowa State Patrol troopers who will provide traffic control during that ride, members of the inspection team instead opted for a scenic ride down the Neal Smith Trail to RAGBRAI headquarters just east of downtown Des Moines, with a stop, of course, at Des Moines cycling landmark Captain Roy's in Birdland Park on the Des Moines River.\n\nIt was the shortest day of the inspection ride, with about 50 miles covered.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n12 p.m. Wednesday\n\n'Dam good time' in Polk City\n\nAs the RAGBRAI route inspection team rolled into Polk City, Mayor Steve Karsjen said cycling could help the fast-growing Des Moines metro town.\n\nThe High Trestle Trail runs just east of the city to Woodward, Madrid, Slater and Ankeny. The Neal Smith Trail runs just south of town. Polk City is working to connect the two trails, he said.\n\nPolk City is preparing to host 60,000 people on July 26, Karsjen said. Like the leaders of other towns on the route, he said the community is not scared of the big figures.\n\n“Cycling is very much in our planning for the future,” he said. “We want to promote Polk City as central Iowa’s recreation destination.”\n\nAs the costumed Polk City beaver reminded the visiting cyclists, the community between Saylorville and Big Creek lakes is a great place to have a \"dam good time.\"\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n11 a.m. Wednesday\n\nRider from 1973 greets route inspection team in Slater\n\nAlmost 50 years ago when Stephen Gaul rode onto Main Street in Slater on the Great Six Day Bicycle Ride, he had no idea that he would later call it home.\n\nGaul, now 68, moved to Slater in 1985 in the midst of a long career as a microbiologist at Iowa State University. His wife was a Grand View University professor and living in Slater put them in the middle of their commutes.\n\nBut when he first saw the town on Aug. 29, 1973, he was just an 18 year old taking a gap year and lucky enough not be fighting in the Vietnam War.\n\nHe was on hand Wednesday morning when the route inspection team for the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, which that 1973 ride launched, arrived to see how its preparations for the this year's 50th anniversary ride were going.\n\nGaul regaled the riders with tales of his experiences on that initial ride. In particular, he recalled that his future home left him deflated ― literally.\n\n“I got my flat tire crossing the (train) tracks coming into Slater,” Gaul said, the only one he had that week. “Luckily I just had to peel it off, put the new one on, pump it up and about 10 minutes later I was running again.”\n\nIn the summer of 1973 Gaul commuted by bike between a job in West Lake Okoboji and his parents’ house in Spencer. Conscription into the U.S. armed forces ended in January 1973, and Gaul had a low enough draft number that he was spared from service before then, he said.\n\nAfter graduating from Spencer High School, he took a year off so he could work and save money for college. Then he saw stories in the Des Moines Register promoting The Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride.\n\n“I decided I want an adventure. I graduated from high school. I’m going to college. I want to do something exciting first,” he said.\n\nGaul carried his tent, clothes and 40 pounds of gear on the back of his 10-speed, French-built bike.\n\nGaul wore cutoff shorts because bike shorts were not popular yet. Instead of a helmet he wore a red and white train conductor’s hat so he could “be seen” by cars. He brought $100 to cover his expenses but did not spend it all. He and other riders got food at gas stations or other places in towns.\n\n“There were no church suppers yet. No churches selling ice cream or pie. So, you had to be responsible for your own meals. No SAG (support-and-gear) wagon to pick you up. No somebody taking your stuff to the next town. It was completely different than it is now.”\n\nLike this year, the shortest day was on Wednesday between Ames and Des Moines.\n\n“That’s when we had the most people,” Gaul said. “Almost 500 bicyclists… It seemed so crowded between Ames and Des Moines.”\n\nWhen RAGBRAI returns to downtown Slater on July 26, there could well more than 100 times as many people.\n\nDespite the crowd that day, when Gaul finished the ride at Vander Veer Park on the Mississippi River in Davenport he was one of only 120 people who had ridden all the way from Sioux City. Gaul rode RAGBRAI again in 1991 and 1993, thought he said it felt “crowded.”\n\nToday Gaul still likes to ride, though a bad knee prevents him from going more than 5 miles at a time. But over the years his experience on the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride inspired him to do longer rides.\n\n“I felt like I was accomplishing something as a youth, something that not many people would do at the time,” Gaul said.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n10 a.m. Wednesday\n\nCycling central to Madrid's economy\n\nRiders on the RAGBRAI Route Inspection Ride cruised into Slater and Madrid Wednesday morning with picture perfect conditions. Riders arrived in Slater almost an hour ahead of schedule. Slater is trying to raise $7 million for a new library, said Jennifer Davies with the city. The town already has raised $1.5 million, Davies said.\n\nMadrid built its economy on coal mining, but the city “struggled to find its identity” as mining ended, said Don Lincoln with the Madrid Chamber of Commerce, a 67-year resident and former longtime City Council member.\n\n“All of a sudden, the High Trestle Trail falls right in our lap,” Lincoln said of the construction of Iowa's most popular biking trail, with its iconic, 140-foot-tall bridge across the Des Moines River just west of town.\n\nThe bridge's railroad deck and been stripped and “all it was was the pillars,” he recalled.\n\nNow the trail and bridge draw hundreds of thousands of visitors annually, and hosting RAGBRAI as a pass-through town will help Madrid celebrate how important cycling is to its economy, Lincoln said.\n\nWeather allowing, July 26 could bring up to 100,000 riders to Madrid, according to RAGBRAI organizers.\n\n“Bring them on,” Lincoln said. “That’s a bunch of people. It will be good for the local economy.”\n\n― Philip Joens\n\nDAY 4\n\n6 a.m. Wednesday\n\nWhat's ahead on Day 4\n\nThis is the big day! We’ll be riding to Des Moines on the route that will bring the 50th anniversary RAGBRAI back to the place where the idea for it was first hatched by Register journalists John Karras and Donald Kaul. Des Moines was, of course, an overnight town on the very first ride in 1973, but the route hasn’t taken riders through the city since 2013, coming closest in 2019 when it passed through Norwalk on the way to Indianola. We’ll also visit Ankeny before pedaling past the gold-domed Iowa Capitol. What will be the route from the Capitol to the campground at Water Works Park for a crowd swelled by thousands of one-day participants taking part in the historic ride? Stay tuned for details.\n\nToday’s route\n\nAmes to Des Moines\n\nMiles: 50\n\nClimb: 1,216 feetMeeting town: Ankeny\n\nPass-through towns: Slater, Madrid and Polk City\n\nWhat to know: RAGBRAI officially is not encouraging any detours from the route. But when the ride passes through Slater on July 26, it will bring riders to within a few easy miles of Iowa’s most iconic cycling landmark, the High Trestle Trail Bridge across the Des Moines River, via the wide, paved High Trestle trail. The chance to see the spectacular bridge, with its sweeping vista of the river valley, will be hard to resist if the weather is right.\n\nDAY 3\n\n4:15 p.m. Tuesday\n\nWaiting for the RAGBRAI route inspection riders, Gwen Page of pass-through town Luther's popular Whatcha Smokin' BBQ + Brew had a sumptuous repast awaiting them: brisket sliders, baked beans and cornbread. She said she expects the July 25 visit by RAGBRAI to be the business' biggest day since it opened in 2017, and has ordered 14,000 pounds of meat to make 46,000 sandwiches: 30% brisket and 70% pulled pork. That compares to selling about 200 pounds of brisket on a very busy Saturday.\n\nHow is she planning to get through the day? “Hard work and prayer,” she said.\n\n― Teresa Albertson\n\n4 p.m. Tuesday\n\nIowa's ever-changing weather\n\nDixon Novy of the Quad Cities, making his sixth RAGBRAI route inspection ride, reached the rest stop at the city park in Luther full of appreciation for the day's perfect weather. “The wind is nice. It’s perfect. This is the first day we have had a tailwind pushing us across,” he said. But Iowa weather is always changing, and an hour later, the riders were huddled under the main entrance overhang at Ames Middle School waiting for a summer storm to pass.\n\nAt least it was nothing more than a passing thunderstorm. Luther bears a reminder of one of the fiercest storms in Iowa's memory, the August 2020 derecho that packed 140 mph winds and brought catastrophic damage to communities across the state. Towering over Fifth Avenue, where the route inspection team entered the town, are three giant metal grain bins. Since repaired, their shredded remains were an iconic symbol of the storm's power.\n\n― Teresa Albertson\n\n3:45 p.m. Tuesday\n\nRide of the century\n\nWaiting to greet the RAGBRAI route inspection riders in the pass-through town of Luther was Boone County Supervisor Eric Kretzinger. He said he rides about 2,000 miles on his bicycle every summer and went on three or four RAGBRAIs, but quit because he got tired of the crowds and sleeping on the ground. However, this year he will be joining the Ride for one day for the century loop, which loops through the Boone County countryside. Members of the team surveyed it Tuesday and pronounced it the most scenic part of the 50th anniversary route so far.\n\n― Teresa Albertson\n\n3:15 p.m. Tuesday\n\nWhat goes down must come up\n\nOne of the big challenges of the day was descending into the Des Moines River valley ― and then climbing back out, a combination of daring and endurance. Scott Olsen said after reaching the other side that he was not going quite full speed on the way down. “You have to eventually stop peddling because you’re going too fast for your bicycle to keep up.” His strategy climbing up out of the valley was “just to beat these two,” he said gesturing to Dave Edwards and Corey Mutch next to him. Scott Matter, on the other hand, never stopped pedaling, saying his technique was to go full speed on the way down and just keep up the momentum on the way back up\n\n― Teresa Albertson\n\n6 a.m. Tuesday\n\nWhat's ahead on Day 3\n\nMost RAGBRAI routes spend a substantial amount of time in Iowa’s smaller towns as they wend their way across the countryside. That’s not a bad thing ― experiencing their warmth and hospitality is part of what makes the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa unique. But it’s also fun sometimes to sample the variety of Iowa’s biggest cities. This year’s 50th anniversary route is an urban cornucopia, visiting five of Iowa’s nine regions populous enough to be classified as metro areas. It starts in Sioux City, ends in Davenport and makes overnight stops in Des Moines, Coralville in metro Iowa City and today’s destination, Ames. The home of 30,000-student Iowa State University can be a bit sleepy in the summer, but it has plenty of year-round attractions, including a wide variety of eateries offering everything from barbecue to Brazilian cuisine. It’s also likely we’ll get to make a lap round the inside of Jack Trice Stadium, home field of Cyclones football. The stadium ride will be one of the highlights of RAGBRAI Day 3.\n\nAlong the way, we’ll also visit Jefferson, home to the Mahanay Memorial Carillon Tower ― which, by the way, will be celebrated with an annual festival this Friday and Saturday. The nearly 170-foot tower has an observation deck, and its bells sound out in a daily concert at 12:15 p.m.\n\nToday’s route\n\nCarroll to Ames\n\nMiles: 83\n\nClimb: 1,479 feet\n\nMeeting town: Rippey\n\nPass-through towns: Glidden, Jefferson and Luther\n\nWhat to know: Today’s elevation gain is moderate compared to the last two days’. But there’s at least one heavy-duty pull when the route crosses the Des Moines River between Rippey and Luther. Iowa’s largest inland river flows through a deep valley amid the prairie. Some of us will be traveling at top speed on the way down to the bridge, while the more cautious among us will be burning our brakes. All of us, though, will be exploring the lowest reaches of our groupsets as we chug up the 6% grade on the other side.\n\nDAY 2\n\n4:30 p.m. Monday\n\nSAGging again for safety\n\nFor a second consecutive day, the RAGBRAI route inspection team ended its day in the SAG wagons. On Sunday, the reason for taking to the support-and-gear vans was a lightning storm that halted the ride short of overnight destination Storm Lake. On Monday, it was the prospect of riding with heavy, high-speed car and truck traffic on a 5-mile stretch of U.S. 71 from pass-through town Mount Carmel to the overnight town of Carroll.\n\nIf the road is part of the final route, the Iowa State Patrol will ensure it's safe for cyclists. But there was no such assurance on Monday, and no need to take a risk after an otherwise scenic ride through hills studded with giant wind turbines.\n\n4 p.m. Monday\n\nBreda: Can you spare a dime?\n\nDay 2 pass-though town Breda will tap RAGBRAI riders to help its raise money for improvements to its decades-old Little League and high school baseball stadium.\n\nLeon Tiefenthaler with Breda’s RAGBRAI organizing committee, who turned out to greet the route inspection team as it visited the town on Monday, said the facility dates back to at least the 1950s. The town is looking to raise $300,000 to replace lights at the ballpark before it celebrates its 150th anniversary in 2027, Tiefenthaler said. The park also needs replacements for some rotted wooden beams and a rusted steel roof, he said.\n\nBreda residents don’t expect to raise the full amount from RAGBRAI, but with every organization pitching in, they hope to get the fundraising off to a good start.\n\nAnd the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa has inspired fundraising miracles on occasion. In 2021, the tiny northwest Iowa crossroads of Lytton staged goat yoga sessions ― yoga with baby goats ― charming riders enough (along with a pie sale) to raise $15,000 toward a new firehouse. That so impressed Ankeny's famously philanthropic Lauridsen family, which has an animal protein plant in Lytton, that they paid off the remaining $50,000 debt on the project.\n\nTiefenthaler said that Breda, population about 500, is trying to engage the young people that still live there. He was among the organizers the last time RAGBRAI came through Breda in 1994, and said hosting the ride is a good way to get new people interested in the community before the sesquicentennial bash.\n\n“You see so many communities that are little and pretty soon they’re pretty well gone by the wayside,” Tiefenthaler said. “The RAGBRAI is a good way to get people involved.\n\nNoon Monday\n\nLess terrain doesn't mean less scenery\n\nSunday's ride was a long, hard pull. Monday's terrain, though far from flat, is ess rugged, yet even more scenic. From Storm Lake to Breda, it offers long-range views of the rolling hills and prairies. Midway is the meeting town of Lake View, an unexpected resort amid the cornfields on a beautiful natural lake with a state park. Riders may be tempted to return sometime to pedal the 33-mile Sauk Rail linking Lake View and Carroll.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n8:30 a.m. Monday\n\nGravel envy\n\nWe face a choice as we start Day 2 of the 50th anniversary RAGBRAI route inspection ride.\n\nThose with gravel bikes may peel off after 2 miles to take the optional, 57-mile gravel day route. Running parallel to the paved route, it's sightly shorter, even if it's a bit bumpy. Those of us on road bikes may wish we could have had that option. The 18-mile route to the pass-through town of Early takes us on a stretch of busy U.S. 71. If that's part of the regular route, it presumably will have traffic control from the Iowa State Patrol. But for today, it means riding for an extended period inches from cars and trucks whizzing by at 65 mph (or more).\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n6 a.m. Monday\n\nWhat's ahead on Day 2\n\nThe original 1973 route of the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride proceeded on Day 2 almost due east from Storm Lake to Fort Dodge. But with seven days to cover instead of six, today’s route inspection ride heads sharply south-southeast, across some of the most scenic rolling hills in northwest Iowa to the pleasant and prosperous overnight town of Carroll. Along the way we’ll navigate the eastern shore of Storm Lake, among the largest of the glacial remnant water bodies in Iowa, then pause near the southernmost in the United States, Black Hawk Lake in the charming meeting town of Lake View. From there, we’ll ride among the towers of one of Iowa’s many wind farms as we aim for the pass-through towns of Breda and unincorporated Mt. Carmel, a tiny crossroads whose outsized Catholic church with a spire topping a high point rivals the wind generators. It’s not far from there to Carroll.\n\nToday’s route\n\nStorm Lake to Carroll\n\nMiles: 62\n\nClimb: 1,818 feet\n\nMeeting town: Lake View\n\nPass-through towns: Early, Breda and Mt. Carmel\n\nWhat to know: Carroll has a prominent place in Iowa athletic annals. It’s often the site of state high school baseball tournaments. It’s also home, not far from the RAGBRAI campground, of a basketball court in Veterans Memorial Park that sports the distinctive purple and gold of the Los Angeles Lakers. What’s the story? In January 1960, the Lakers, then a Minneapolis team, were flying home from an away game when their airplane lost its generator, leaving it without lights, radio and navigation. Far off course and running out of fuel, the pilots ditched in a snow-covered cornfield in Carroll. All aboard survived, and the town’s residents, who had heard the clearly troubled plane circling, turned out to feed and shelter the grateful players. In a 2010 50th anniversary tribute, the now-LA team paid $25,000 to build the court.\n\n5 p.m. Sunday\n\nEven the experts know they have to sag sometimes.\n\nEight miles outside the overnight destination of Storm Lake, after 62 miles of steep hills and headwinds, the about 40 members of the RAGBRAI route inspection crew hit an obstacle they declined to challenge: a threatening lightning storm. We loaded our bikes on the support-and-gear vans (SAG wagons) for a safe ride into town.\n\nIt's a reminder that those who join July's ride without buying at least a day pass will be on their own if the weather turns threatening.\n\nThe Day 1 route (and Day 2 on Monday) are likely to be the most rural of the ride. Sunday's ride started from Sioux City, population about 85,00. But the route quickly turned into farmland as far as they eye could see, with more than 20 miles between towns.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\nWatermelon Days host to welcome RAGBRAI with guess what?\n\n2:15 p.m. Sunday\n\nIowa isn't all corn and soybeans.\n\nQuimby has a long tradition of celebrating summer with watermelon. The town's annual Watermelon Days festival hands out 2,000 pounds annually of the refreshing treat on the fourth weekend of June.\n\nRiders on the 50th anniversary edition of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa will get an extra share: 3,000 pounds will be ready for slicing when they roll through July 23. RAGBRAI inspection route riders on Sunday got an advance sample during a stop a the town's fire department.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n1:30 p.m. Sunday\n\nWashta plans a chilly reception for RAGBRAI\n\nDay 1 meetup town Washta is planning a chilly welcome for RAGBRAI's 50th anniversary ride.\n\nThe Cherokee County town of barely more than 200 has a peculiar claim to fame: It registered a temperature of 47 degrees below zero on Jan. 12, 1912, the lowest on record in Iowa. So when the riders on the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa roll in, town RAGBRAI committee chair Jen Connor said Sunday, Washta will be ready with a dunk tank full of icy water.\n\nIt might seem a bit off-putting, but if July 23's weather is anything like it is for today's route inspection ride ― 89 degrees and intensely sunny ― the prospective dunkees will likely be hoping for on-target throws from the dunkers.\n\nIt's the first time in eight years that Washta, which was on the original 1973 route, will be hosting RAGBRAI. The ride then cut off registration at 12,000 to 15,000, but this year it has already registered 28,000, so Connor is urging everyone to prepare for a crowd at least twice the size of 2015's.\n\n\"We're trying to plan big because we know this is going to be huge,\" Connor said. \"All the vendors know to prepare double what you're used to doing.\"\n\nShe's concerned, though, that they may no be picturing just how crowded it could get.\n\n\"I don't think they're putting into perspective doubling that number,\" she said.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n11 a.m. Sunday\n\nDay 1 this year could shatter records\n\nJust how big will the 50th anniversary RAGBRAI be?\n\nOrganizers of the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa offered some perspective as we made our way along the Day 1 route on Sunday.\n\nLast year's RAGBRAI drew about 18,000 registered riders ― respectable attendance boosted by easier travel from out of state as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.\n\nThis year, there are 28,000, a 55% increase. And that's not counting the unregistered riders who boosted last year's Day 1 ridership to 30,000, the third-largest in RAGBRAI history.\n\nA similar spike on Day 1 this year would push the total ridership north of a record-shattering 45,000. And that's before the Day 4 ride from Ames to Des Moines that's expected to be the largest in the ride's history.\n\nThe giant, rolling party ― with the line of riders stretching from horizon to horizon ― is one of the things that makes RAGBRAI special. But it feels like a privilege to be riding the route today with just the 40-member inspection crew.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n10:15 a.m. Sunday\n\nDay 1 route has its ups and downs\n\nRide director Matt Phippen wasn't exaggerating when he said the route for the 50th anniversary edition of RAGBRAI will be hilly.\n\nIt's always a hard pull climbing out of the Missouri River valley on Day 1 of the ride. But as we began the route inspection ride today, we encountered 13 of the day's 22 hills during the 29-mile segment that brought us to the pass-through town of Kingsley ― less than half the total 70-mile distance to overnight town Storm Lake. And with a bit of an easterly headwind, it got our hearts pumping.\n\nIt wasn't that Phippen was trying to torture us. The Day 1 route is the only one of this year's ride to duplicate the first day of the original ride in 1973, mapped by the two Register journalists, John Karras and Donald Kaul, who founded the event.\n\nBut there was something else that raised our pulse rates: the scenic beauty of the Loess Hills that march eastward from the river. Raised in Sioux City, I may be biased, but as a veteran of many Register's Annual Great Bicycle Rides Across Iowa, I've seen how the vistas of green pastures and corn and soybean fields cut into the hills affect the riders from around the world visiting Iowa for the first time.\n\nAnd for those of us who've lived most of our lives here, it's a dramatic reminder of why Karras and Kaul wanted to make this ride in the first place.\n\n9 a.m. Sunday\n\nMom's photos commemorate RAGBRAI history\n\nIt’s hard to imagine nowadays, but there once was a time when everybody didn’t have a phone with a built-in camera in their pocket.\n\nThat was the case in 1973, when a pair of Register journalists launched what would become the Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nPhotos of the start of that initial ride aren’t easy to come across, but there are a few, thanks to Kent Williams’ mother Shirley. Williams, now 65, was a 15-year-old from Eagle Grove when he participated in the initial day of what was then the Great Six Day Bicycle Ride with his father Roger, a school guidance counselor.\n\nWilliams said it was father’s idea.\n\n“He said, ‘Let’s go on this bike ride’ because we had ridden bicycles together from Eagle Grove to Minneapolis to visit his brother and go to a Twins baseball game and we had ridden bicycles to eastern Iowa,\" he said.\n\nHe remembers it was a beautiful, blue-sky day, if a bit hot (the temperature would hit 99 degrees) as he and his father joined the roughly 200 riders who showed up to accompany Register journalists John Karras and Donald Kaul.\n\n“I was so excited. It was an early moment of greatness to be able to be sitting on a bicycle next to Karras and Kaul,” said Williams, who was a Des Moines Register paperboy at the time. “They were larger-than-life heroes when you could read their stuff in the paper.”\n\nWilliams’ mother, now 88, photographed the founding duo and Williams and his dad as they took off from the Rodeway Inn where Karras and Kaul had spent the previous night. Sioux City RAGBRAI organizers used Williams’ photos to pinpoint the location.\n\n“People did come and stand around and look to see what was going on,” Shirley Williams recalled, but no one seemed to realize they were witnessing history. “I think they just thought ‘There’s a bunch of crazy people going on a bike ride.’”\n\nMore:Varsity Cinema hosts premiere of 'Shift: The RAGBRAI Documentary' for sold-out crowd\n\nKent Williams rode the Second Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa in 1974 with his father and a friend. But he never rode RAGBRAI again after that. He had a long career in Army, could never get a week off work and settled in Oklahoma. But his father, with his mother as support driver, rode RAGBRAI through 1981. He died in 1992.\n\n“It’s become something that I miss,” Williams said. “To me, the people that ride on it are legends.”\n\nOn June 3, despite having a total knee replacement not long before, Williams decided to ride the first day of RAGBRAI this year. He’ll reminisce and think about his Dad as he makes the nostalgic journey.\n\n“It’d be cool to say I’m one of the few people who rode the first and 50th RAGBRAI,” Williams said.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n8 a.m. Sunday\n\nSuess-inspired sculpture will mark site of original ride's start\n\nThe 50th anniversary RAGBRAI inspection ride is underway. We're starting from Sioux City, where the city plans to mark the starting point of the initial ride with a bike sculpture inspired by the Dr. Seuss classic “The Cat in the Hat.”\n\nAs historic sites go, the former Rodeway Inn at Second and Nebraska streets in Sioux City where Register journalists John Karras and Donald Kaul had spent the night before starting what was then the Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride on Aug. 26, 1973, is a bit on the sad side. The hotel is now dilapidated and under renovation.\n\nBut it was outside the old motel at Second and Nebraska streets that more than 200 riders joined them ― Register readers responding to an impromptu invite to participate in a ride Karras and Kaul had envisioned as one they would go on alone. It planted the seed that grew into the Register's Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, now the world's largest annual weeklong bicycle tour.\n\nSince the motel doesn't look like much these days and it's private property, the city will install the sculpture across the street on the lawn of the Sioux City Art Center.\n\nJohn Byrnes, Sioux City Parks and Recreation superintendent, said Sioux City wants the sculpture to be as fun and welcoming as RAGBRAI. Crafted by a local welding shop, it's a 25-foot-long “amorphous” tandem bike, like something out of a Seuss drawing, that people can pose on for photos, Byrnes said.\n\n“It’s not this individualistic ride, what makes it fun is other people,” Byrnes said. “It’s going to be this absurd sculpture that you won’t be able to stay away from.”\n\nWhen RAGBRAI is over the sculpture will be moved to a permanent place on a bike trail. Byrnes said it will serve as a continual reminder of RAGBRAI.\n\n― Philip Joens\n\n6 a.m. Sunday\n\nRAGBRAI 50th anniversary inspection ride starts, and we're along for the journey\n\nWelcome to our live coverage of the RAGBRAI 50th anniversary inspection ride.\n\nWhen Des Moines Register journalists John Karras and Donald Kaul set out on their Great Six-Day Bicycle Ride in 1973, they and the roughly 200 riders who joined them dealt with obstacles like closed bridges, blocked roads and rutted pavement as they came to them.\n\nBut as the ride evolved into what is now the Register’s Annual Bicycle Ride Across Iowa, with thousands of people biking a seven-day route, professionalism took hold. Now, the ride has a dedicated, year-round staff that makes an inspection ride each June, weeks before the actual July RAGBRAI. It’s when they and invited guests can scrutinize the roads on which they’ll travel and make changes to the route or seek improvements where needed.\n\nAs RAGBRAI prepares for its 50th anniversary edition July 23-29, that ride begins today. Register, Ames Tribune and Iowa City Press-Citizen reporters and photographers will come along to document the route and provide a glimpse of what to expect on the historic ride.\n\nToday’s route\n\nSioux City to Storm Lake, just as on the first ride, in places following the original route.\n\nMiles: 77\n\nClimb: 3,504 feet\n\nMeeting town: Washta\n\nPass-through towns: Kingsley and Quimby\n\nWhat to know: In 1973, this leg full of steep hills on a 99-degree day winnowed the entourage, but launched the legend of Clarence Pickard, a retired 83-year-old Indianola farmer who persevered for the entire ride on a second-hand women’s bicycle he bought the day before it began. And the town of Kingsley, one of this-year’s pass through, drew special praise in Karras’ coverage of the ride, becoming the first in a long line of towns to display vaunted Iowa hospitality by providing the riders with food and drinks courtesy of its business community.\n\nMore to come: Keep checking back throughout the day, and this week's ride, for news of our adventure.", "authors": [],

Check back throughout the week.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nWebb player has winning connection — her mom\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nWebb School junior Casey Collier had just been named the Division II-A East region basketball tournament MVP on Feb. 17 and was proudly discussing the team’s success when she was asked a question she was expecting.\n\nIt was: What has it been like playing for her mother, longtime head coach Shelley Collier.\n\n“I actually get asked that question a lot,” she said with a laugh before adding that she does not know anything different. “I’ve been playing for her basically my whole life.”\n\nHer mother also gets asked periodically another question she is usually expecting: What was it like playing for Pat Summitt at Tennessee. A point guard on the Lady Vols’ first national championship team in 1987, she later went on to be a graduate assistant for Summitt before embarking on a high school coaching career now totaling roughly three decades.\n\nBut she has never forgotten the many lessons Summitt taught her, and one particularly stands out.\n\n“Pat always said, ‘You win with people,’ ” Collier said. “It’s not all about winning games. It is about the relationships you have along the way in your journey.”\n\nAs the Webb Lady Spartan team was battling deep into the playoffs yet again this winter, Collier recently reflected on a coaching career that has included several state championships and four other unique rewards – coaching her four daughters.\n\nShe formerly coached Katie (now on the Middle Tennessee State team) and Sydney. Now, Casey, a junior, and freshman Britney are on the Webb squad.\n\nCoach Collier grew up in a household large enough to field a team as well. The second-oldest of six siblings, the former Shelley Sexton first developed her love for basketball when she was in the third grade in Anderson County.\n\n“My grandmother got me interested in playing,” she said. “We would play in between the games or at halftime of the middle schools' girls and boys games at Lake City (now Rocky Top). And I grew up watching Tennessee basketball and Lady Vol basketball.”\n\nHer skill developed and she received invitations to the prestigious B/C All-Star basketball camps in Georgia. After finishing out her senior year in 1983 during the first year of Anderson County High School, a career that resulted in her picture later being placed outside the gym, she went on to play for Summitt at Tennessee.\n\nAlso following her there as a coach was her Anderson County coach, Tony Cross, who later went on to a successful career as the Belmont University women’s coach. But like coach Summitt, who had battled Alzheimer’s disease, he also died in recent months while only in his 60s. Collier also considers him a great mentor.\n\nOf the influence of Summitt on her life, Collier said, “There are many things I have learned from her. There is not a day that goes by that I do not think about her.”\n\nAfter finishing at Tennessee, Collier stayed on as a graduate assistant for coach Summitt and coached at Clinton and Karns before arriving at Webb just when she was starting her family with husband, Robby Collier, now a football assistant at Webb.\n\nWhile at Webb, she has had several standout players, including Glory Johnson, who went on to play for Tennessee. During at least one of Johnson’s games, Webb’s gym was packed with three college coaches – Summitt, Georgia coach Andy Landers and Kentucky coach Mickey DeMoss.\n\nSuch players have helped the Webb team enjoy perennial success. But for coach Collier, the daily banter with players has been as important as all the banners.\n\n“I’m very passionate about having an opportunity to work around young kids on a daily basis,” she said. “It is a blessing and a calling for me to be able to do that. Coaching is not something that I take lightly, as I try to give back to the game and to those who have influenced me and to the young ladies that I have the privilege of coaching every day.\n\nAnd, of course, there have been the special relationships that have come from getting the unusual opportunity to coach four daughters on a high school varsity level.\n\nFor Casey, that has been quite natural, even with all the obvious expectations and demands her mother has placed on all the team members.\n\n“It is definitely hard at times because she’s my mom, but I wouldn’t want to play for anyone else,” she said.\n\nCasey has been the daughter in the spotlight at Webb this year. While usually not the top scorer, she helps the team by providing various intangibles. And that has made Shelley a proud coach – and mom.\n\n“We don’t win on the court without her,” said Collier after the region championship victory over Christian Academy of Knoxville. “She does so much for us. She’s a point guard. She’s a leader.”\n\nCoach Collier jokingly added that her daughters have grown up seeing her as the coach of Webb, so they don’t know her in any other setting.\n\nBut Casey believes she deserves another title in addition to coach and mom – winner.\n\n“She’s the best coach in the state of Tennessee and I love her to death,” she added with feeling.\n\nKARNS\n\nUniversity Eye Specialists opens new office in Hardin Valley\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nUniversity Eye Specialists officially opened its doors on 2547 Willow Point Way in Hardin Valley with a ribbon cutting celebration on Tuesday, Feb. 20.\n\nThe event was attended by several members of the Knoxville Chamber as well as Knox County Commissioners Michele Carringer and Brad Anders.\n\n“We are committed to serving patients with integrity and compassion, and we are honored to help our patients keep life in focus,” said Will Pitt, CEO of University Eye Specialists. “This new clinic allows us to offer even more vision care and optical options for our patients.\n\n“With 17 doctors, 14 medical and three optometrists, we provide a comprehensive range of eye care from the most routine to the most complex whether you need glasses or have a cornea issue. Our physicians are the only comprehensive ophthalmologists in the Knoxville area that treat Level One trauma patients at UT Medical Center.”\n\nFounded in 1935 by Dr. John L. Montgomery Sr., the practice has grown to five locations in Knoxville, Maryville and Morristown.\n\n“We’ve been recognized regionally and nationally by our peers for excellence in eye care, but most of all, we have caring hearts,\" Pitt said.\n\n“We’re excited to bring those caring hearts to the Hardin Valley area. We’re super excited about joining the community here. Coming here was an easy decision, we want to be part of the growth. It’s a wonderful area that’s certainly up and coming.”\n\nInfo: www.universityeye.com\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nPinchok announces he’ll seek another term\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\n“There’s too much unfinished business and I’d like to still be involved and make a difference in the community as long as I can,” declared Ron Pinchok as he revealed his decision to run for his second term as alderman, South Ward II. In a recent interview, the Board of Mayor and Alderman vice chairman talked about what’s important to Farragut, and to him.\n\n“We need to do what we can to help our retail and commercial businesses,” he said. How do we do that? Pinchok says, “By getting the right businesses to look at us, connecting with developers and then bringing them together. That in turn will benefit the town with increased sales tax revenues.” He cited Costco as a successful example.\n\nFuture development is another concern. “About 75 percent (of Farragut) is built out; now we have to be careful and pro-active.” Pinchok envisions the corridor north and east of I-40 and Campbell Station Road (Outlet Drive) as an optimal place for entertainment sites. “Ideally, businesses like restaurants, maybe a dinner theater, bowling alley or sports venue would provide families with activities.” The location lends itself to easy access for regional travelers.\n\nThat brings us to tourism. Pinchok says, “It’s another piece of the puzzle.” He has long been an advocate of attracting outside visitors to Farragut. With his extensive background in business, he understands return on investment. During the National League of Cities conference he attended, statistics confirmed that marketing and advertising dollars generate impressive returns.\n\nAccording to the study presented at that conference, every dollar spent returns $115 to local businesses, with $6 returned to the tax base. The recent addition of a part-time tourism coordinator will enable the town to reach a larger audience. “We’ve done the branding, now we’ll do more marketing,” said Pinchok.\n\nPinchok has been in favor of continuing to improve parks, greenways and recreational facilities. “It adds to a healthier lifestyle and increases our property values,” he said. “We have seen the success of events like the Lawn Chair Concert series, and with the addition of a ‘great lawn’ and the other amenities planned for McFee Park, we can expand that.”\n\nA real “hot button” issue in town has been the proliferation of empty storefronts; BOMA is limited on what it can do to affect these private properties. Pinchok sees a way to avoid this in the future, noting, “Form-based building allows for sites to be repurposed for another use. Should a retail business go out, offices or other commercial uses can occupy the space with minimal renovation.”\n\nA 30-year resident of Farragut, Pinchok and his family have been involved in the community for many years. His wife, Debbie, serves on the PALS committee, and Pinchok, previously the chair of the Economic Development Committee, now serves as the liaison to the town. Also on the Tennova Metro Board of Directors, Pinchok looks forward to the future, saying, “ There are a lot of exciting things to come and I want to be part of that.”\n\nPOWELL\n\nAt JB's market, selling local goes back a long way\n\nMike Blackerby, Shopper News correspondent\n\nCombine a line of hard-to-find products, ultra-friendly customer service and a long local history and you’ve got JB’s Corner Market in Powell.\n\nAcross the street from Claxton Elementary School at 2231 Clinton Hwy., the quaint produce and goods store is a throwback to simpler times and has a strong local following.\n\n“We love local people and try to keep prices as low as we can,” said Natalia Meredith, who owns JB’s with her husband, Justin Meredith.\n\nJB’s has an assortment of authentic Amish products, ranging from meat and dairy products such as bacon and cheese, to jams, jellies and candy.\n\nDepending on the time of year, JB’s also offers a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables and different types of beans in bulk.\n\n“In season, we buy our fruits and vegetables from local farmers,” said Natalia.\n\n“Soon we’ll have Grainger County tomatoes, green beans and cucumbers.”\n\nOther local products include items like honey and sorghum.\n\nFresh stone-ground Southern corn meal has trouble staying on the shelves.\n\n“They’re one of our better sellers,” said Natalia.\n\nYou can always find loaves of bread for sale at JB’s for just 99 cents.\n\nNatalia said her goal is to have as few products as possible with preservatives in the store.\n\n“Our Amish butter has just three ingredients – cream, salt and milk. There are no preservatives. We are trying to get people as healthy as possible. You won’t get something here that I wouldn’t eat myself. It’s not always possible to have foods without preservatives, but we’re very close.”\n\nJB’s has a long local history, according to Justin. “This building, an old gas station, was built in 1931,” he said.\n\nOperating local markets runs in the blood of the Meredith family.\n\nJustin’s grandfather J.B. Meredith opened Meredith’s City Food Market in downtown Clinton in 1950. Justin’s grandfather opened JB’s Market at its current location in 1975 before his father, who was also named J.B. Meredith, took it over in the 1980s.\n\nJustin took over the business in 2012 after the death of his father.\n\n“It does take you back in time,” said Justin.\n\nNatalia said a loyal local customer following allows JB’s to stay in business and compete against bigger box stores.\n\n“We’ve got one customer who is 94 years old who came to the store when it first opened and helped lay the blocks for the original building. He still comes to the store. People have been really good to us.”\n\nNatalia said the family is glad they decided to keep the store open following J.B.’s death in 2011.\n\n“We had a choice to get rid of it or keep it for his daddy,” she said.\n\n“I get a lot of joy out of it, personally.”\n\nJB’s (865-945-5580) is open from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nMore:Zaxby's opens near Walmart, Knoxville Center Mall\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\nHarold Agnew: a rich life built on music and faith\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nHarold Agnew never talks very long without breaking into song. The 90-year-old licensed barber, singer, guitar and piano player seems to know every gospel tune ever written. Snatches of melody constantly pepper his conversation. “The only problem is,” says Gary Gamble, owner of Gam’s Hair Fashions, where Agnew still works six days a week, “he never sings the whole song. You have to go to church to hear the whole thing.”\n\nLast Friday was Agnew’s 90th birthday, and there was a celebration for him at Rogers Memorial Baptist Church. Family and friends did indeed get to hear the tenor sing “the whole thing;” Agnew was happy to perform for them.\n\nBorn in Belton, S.C., to parents Allie and Henry, Agnew is the next-to-last in age of nine girls and seven boys. All are gone except one sister in S.C. and “my baby brother” in Boston, Mass., who will be 88 this year.\n\n“I was a farmer boy. We picked cotton, grew watermelon, cantaloupe, muscadines, climbed trees, raised cows. I made it through 10th grade; I don’t have a diploma. I graduated in experience. I’ve been through some things.”\n\nHe served in Germany during WWII as an Army corporal. Returning stateside, he was on his way to join his brother in Columbus, Ohio, and take a job in a steel mill when he came through Knoxville and met up with members of the Southern Travelers Gospel Singers. They needed a guitar player, “so I never got any further!” He became their lead tenor and guitarist; his brother Charles was also in the group. “They’re all gone now,” says Agnew. “I’m the only one left.”\n\nHis eyes twinkle. “You know who sponsored us? Cas Walker. He bought us our first uniforms.”\n\nAmong his treasure trove of pictures and memorabilia is a well-worn picture of his wife, Mallie. The two married in 1949 and he lost her in 2005 after 56 years of marriage. “We started in first grade together in S.C. That was Mallie. That was my wife. Shoot, I love that woman. Miss her.” The couple had four children — Harold Jr., who died in 2001; Robert Louis; Anna Ruth; and Rita, who just retired after 32 years as a schoolteacher.\n\nAgnew’s rich voice has made him the go-to singer in many situations, but mainly, he says, “I’m known as ‘the funeral singing man.’” Friend Rudy Warner says Agnew “has been at more funerals than the undertaker.”\n\n“At funerals I sing songs and talk — I’d rather have them laughing than crying. The scripture says ‘you mourn when people come into the world and you rejoice when they leave.’ But we do it backwards! What is that song — ‘I’ll have nothin’ to do … but just walk around heaven all day ….’ That’s a good one.”\n\nHe quotes his father: “Laugh when you’re tickled, come when you’re called, think before you speak and look before you leap.” And, he says, “I don’t worry about anything. I can’t undo what I did yesterday and tomorrow hasn’t gotten here yet. Worry and stress will get you. I live one day at a time.”\n\nBut mostly, says Agnew, “I can’t hate. The Bible says you have to love, and you can’t love and hate at the same time.”\n\nMore:Central High School taking proactive approach for school safety\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nPolitics on the menu at mayor candidate forum\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe Farragut/West Knox Chamber served up three candidates for Knox County mayor at the kickoff of its 2018 Breakfast Speaker Series at Fox Den Country Club on Feb. 20. The ballroom was packed as members and guests gathered to hear Brad Anders, Glenn Jacobs and Bob Thomas answer questions submitted by the chamber and audience.\n\nIntroduced as “the most trusted communicator in East Tennessee,” moderator Hallerin Hilton Hill laid out the ground rules: Each candidate would answer every question within the allotted time after giving an opening statement about why he was running.\n\nAnders, a nearly lifelong resident, has been with the Knox County Sheriff’s Office for 26 years and is currently a lieutenant in the Special Crimes Unit. He’s been a county commissioner since 2008, serving as chair and vice chair, and says the county “is better than it was (then) and I’m a part of that.”\n\nJacobs earned a national reputation as a professional wrestler and is the only candidate without political experience. The owner of an insurance business in West Knox, Jacobs is running “because I love this place (Knoxville).” He wants to ensure that “the standard of living and quality of life remains high.”\n\nFor Thomas, Farragut holds a special place; both his son and daughter are FHS grads. A county commissioner since 2014, he has 40 years of business and media experience. Thomas says, “I want to leave this place better than I found it.”\n\nHill asked how the trio would deal with safety and security. Anders said, “It’s right in my wheelhouse,” while Jacobs is in favor of a mental health task force. Thomas feels “there is a breakdown in society and family; all of us need to be part of the solution.”\n\nAn audience member posed a question that’s on everyone’s minds: “Do you plan on raising property taxes during your term?” Both Jacobs and Thomas answered no. Citing fiscal soundness and tremendous growth, neither is in favor of more taxes and would look to public-private partnerships and attracting business growth to fund government.\n\nAnders was more circumspect, noting that county debt has increased over the last three years. “It takes $2.5 million a day to run the county,” he said, adding, “I certainly don’t want to raise taxes, but to take it off the table is foolish and pandering to voters and we don’t know what three years or four years looks like from now.”\n\nSeveral other questions were asked and each candidate had equal time to present his ideas and vision. They all have different styles, but everyone wants good jobs, more educational opportunities, safety and infrastructure improvement.

The café doesn’t require a bus — they can just come and work.”\n\nSanders Plumbing reached out to see if the special education class needed anything. Upon request it donated coffee and snacks, and Jeremy Roberson, a manager at Lowe's on Clinton Highway, donated a mini-fridge. To keep costs down, parents donated snacks and drinks, and the faculty provided a cookie display cabinet.\n\nThe coffee cart business expanded so rapidly that they soon needed a larger space. “Our principal, Mr. Duff, was nice enough to give us this location,” said Reed about the former PTA storage closet. “It took about two days to clean it out and set it up.”\n\nAll items, including coffee, soda, candy bars, chips and pastries, are $1 unless they are in the 50-cent bargain bin. “Any money raised is put back into the café itself,” said Reed.\n\n“The main thing is to prepare them for work opportunities, so that they have experience to put on their resume.”\n\nRevenue is used to buy items in bulk and ingredients to bake more cookies, brownies and muffins. Tasks include preparing items, opening and closing, serving customers, inventory and restocking.\n\nWorking in the café allows students to develop their next-dollar (rounding up) and counting-back-change skills. “A lot of students are working on sorting,” said Reed. “For example, they sort the different sugar packages and the chips.”\n\nStudents also practice smiling and being pleasant to customers as well as focusing on the volume of their voices and appropriate proximity. “It’s been a great way to help them achieve their communication goal,” said Reed. “It encourages them to have communications with both their peers and staff at Halls.”\n\nRed Devil Café even boasts an online ordering system for the teachers. “They can go online and order via Google Docs or call in their order. Orders can be collected or delivered during a teacher’s specified planning time.\"\n\nAnd when students navigate the school to make deliveries, Reed said it helps increase their independence.\n\nReed said the cafeteria ladies have been particularly helpful and that community involvement has been overwhelming. “I want to be sure to mention Brenda Chesney, Kim Webb, Tammy Fox, Missy Green, Quineesh Phillips, Dale Richnafsky and our principal,” said Reed. “They all helped facilitate the café.”\n\nRed Devil Café is open every school day and staffed by students in the ninth through 12th grades working a rotating schedule. Set-up starts at 7:45 and the café opens at 8:30 a.m. and runs until noon, closing down for lunch and reopening 1:15-2:45 for afternoon snacks.\n\nIn the future, the class hopes to partner with local business to offer breakfast items – such as breakfast sandwiches and wraps on specific days.\n\nKARNS\n\nKarns Elementary kids put their hearts in it, raise $15K\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nMore than 200 students at Karns Elementary School got their hearts pumping jumping rope for the American Heart Association during the Jump Rope for Heart Celebration Day held at the school Wednesday, Feb. 14.\n\nThe kids raised nearly $15,000 in the two-week fundraising campaign, placing them in the top 10 statewide.\n\nBut it’s more than about money, says American Heart Association Youth Market Director Jenny Kitts. It’s about empowerment.\n\n“The kids learn the American Heart Association Five for Life, which is drink more water, eat more fruits and vegetables, be physically active every day, don’t touch the salt shaker, and don’t smoke.\n\n“They take the challenge to improve on one of these areas and to challenge others not only to donate money, but to improve on these areas as well.\n\n“It’s very powerful because it’s not uncommon for 100 people to drink more water or increase their activity level due to one fourth-grader.”\n\nGone are the days of knocking on doors. The kids gathered the money mostly through online activities featuring “The Scare Squad” characters and emailing friends and family to donate.\n\nThe kids earn a multitude of “Thank You” gifts along the way, including character plush, keychains, balls, jump ropes, and T-shirts.\n\nTen-year-old Emma Rainey raised $455, placing her among the top earners. She received almost all the available “Thank You” gifts, including a glow in the dark T-shirt, but she said it wasn’t about the prizes for her.\n\n“This is my third year doing this; next year will be my last, and I’ve challenged myself to raise $1,000 next year. It’s all to honor a family friend that had a heart transplant in 2015.\n\n“It’s nice to win all the prizes, but it’s better to help people,” she said.\n\nInfo: http://american.heart.org/jump-hoops\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nTo experience faith more meaningfully, look at the full story\n\nTom Ogburn, Shopper News columist\n\nSome years ago, I wrote a short and simple book about my family history. It was an appealing task because over the course of my lifetime, I had heard a number of family myths about our past. I was fascinated by some of the stories and was eager to find out more about them. As I looked more carefully at some of the more dramatic myths, they faltered under the weight of the research. The surprising thing was the true stories were actually more interesting, even more dramatic, than the myths I had heard. I was able to trace our family line back almost 400 years and learn more about those who carried our name well beyond that.\n\nOur family stories matter because as we learn more about where we come from, we discover some of what makes us who we are. We are now in the Lenten season, that 40-day period many Christian traditions claim as a time of preparation for Easter. If we are purposeful in claiming a time of preparation, it will invite us to both remember and explore our faith story – a discipline that illuminates who we are just as much as our family histories do.\n\nWe should remember those moments when we have seen God at work in our lives – those first moments of faith – when God’s love felt close and life-changing. In those stories, we find our place in God’s family. Galatians 3 tells us, So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.\n\nWe should also take this time to explore our faith story. So often we are content to hear stories from pastors or Sunday school teachers without taking the time to read the story on our own. This means we too often encounter God’s great story a small piece at a time. This would be a great time to read the whole story in the Gospel of Matthew or Luke. You might be surprised by some of what you encounter. When you read a gospel in its entirety, it can give you a fresh perspective of the depth and breadth of God’s love on display in Jesus. When you read the gospel story as a whole, you may discover that your faith story is even more powerful than you might have imagined.\n\nAs followers of Christ, we are an Easter people. But Easter can mean more to us if we walk with Jesus as he preaches, teaches, loves and cares for those he encounters on the way to Jerusalem. Easter can mean more to us when we take the time to purposefully come to the foot of the cross – redemption on display. Easter can mean more to us when we come to the resurrection tomb as witnesses of the great work of God through Jesus. We have a great faith story. Let’s take the journey toward Easter together.\n\nTom Ogburn, D.Min., is senior pastor at First Baptist Church in downtown Knoxville.

The three Cedar Bluff Elementary School students have been involved in community service before, but this was the biggest undertaking of their young lives.\n\nTroop leader and mom Becky Hatfield was brainstorming with the girls about a service project and that’s how Backpacks for Kids in Crisis took shape. The idea was to provide comfort to kids facing stressful situations like being placed in protective custody, staying in a homeless shelter or having their home destroyed by fire. “Even if it provides just a few minutes of happiness it’s worth it,” said Hatfield.\n\nThe backpacks are filled with necessities like toothbrushes, toothpaste and shampoo. Hats and gloves will provide warmth while stuffed animals, small toys, readers and activity books can help add a little diversion. Shelf-stable snacks, free ice cream and meal coupons from local restaurants are included, too.\n\nPlanning, organizing and getting donations took time and a lot of legwork. Over a dozen individuals and businesses generously gave cash, gift cards and products to the project. Sponsors were Delta Dental, Teacher Supply Depot, National Entertainment Network, Walmart, Publix, Food City, Second Harvest, Texas Roadhouse, Chick-fil-A, Dairy Queen, and Burger King. Sheila Roark and Pam Smith are friends who contributed; others wanted to remain anonymous.\n\nFor the three Junior Girl Scouts, it was a life lesson and an opportunity to do something good for kids who need a little comfort. Talking about the experience, 9-year-old Savannah said, “I liked to help out other kids.” Alyssa, 10, noted, “When kids get taken away from their parents it can be upsetting.” And Addie, also 10, admitted “We had fun doing it.”\n\nOn a rainy Saturday 10 days ago, 217 bags were loaded up and delivered to the KARM shelter on Broadway, Rural Metro at Campbell Station and Knoxville Police Department headquarters. Three generations of families came along to lend a hand. Expressing what everyone felt, Hatfield said, “I’m so proud of all of them and their caring hearts.” Great job, girls, and now the Hatfields can get their dining room back!\n\nHALLS\n\nKids pour hearts into 'Blessing Bags' for needy\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nStudent Council members at Halls Elementary have been busy filling gallon zipper bags with snacks and simple, everyday items to hand out to people in need.\n\nThe bags, called Blessing Bags, are filled with tissue, gum, socks, lotion, personal items and snack foods. Students put the word out at school and church, asking for donations of items to fill the bags. Thanks to generous donations from the community, including a large donation from the Coffee family and Dental Partners Dr. Allen Hunley and Dr. Andrew Patten, more than 100 bags were assembled and ready to distribute.\n\nPaige LeQuire's family hands many of the bags out under the bridge near Knox Area Rescue Ministries and ministers to those in need through them.\n\n\"Knowing that we are providing a need feels good. I am very proud of what the group is doing to help others,\" said Paige.\n\nStudent Council members are in the fourth and fifth grades at Halls Elementary, and their hearts for giving are huge. When asked about the experience, many expressed good feelings of helping others, making a positive change in the community, letting people know they aren't forgotten and giving others hope through a smile and a kind gesture.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nWest swimmer/musician tunes up for college\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe multifaceted West High School junior Coleman Kredich enjoys the usually soft and melodic sounds he is able to make when playing classical music with his violin, an instrument he has played since age 2.\n\nBut his best route to college might be the loud splashing – but also rhythmic – sounds he makes in the pool as a freestyle sprinter.\n\nHe recently demonstrated these latter skills in the state high school swim meet by placing second in the 50-yard freestyle and third in the 100 free. His 50 time of 20.45 seconds was just behind Bearden senior Caleb Harrington, while his 100 free time was an also-satisfying 45.34 seconds at the University of Tennessee’s Allan Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center.\n\n“I was really happy,” the 6-foot athlete said in an interview a few days after the meet. “I dropped my time in the 50 free. I get to go to Irvine (Calif.) for the Summer Junior Nationals.”\n\nWhile in California, he is likely to continue to be observed by a few college swimming coaches on the recruiting trail. Kredich said he definitely wants to swim in college.\n\n“I’m looking at UT, Duke, Harvard, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania,” he said.\n\nDuke is where his parents went and where he is familiar with the coaches, he said. And he knows the coach at UT pretty well, too – his father, Matt Kredich, who heads up both the men’s and women’s programs.\n\nAs a result, he does not want to go to another SEC school where he would regularly have to compete against the elder Kredich.\n\nColeman said he loves the fact that his father is the coach, and he does not feel any extra pressure as a swimmer with that last name.\n\n“It’s pretty cool,” he said. “When I go to swim meets, people know who my dad is.”\n\nHowever, as far as receiving any extra tips about swimming from his father, it actually would have to come from osmosis. The elder Kredich deliberately does not want to interfere with the other coaches who work more closely with him.\n\n“I will ask him about something, and he says to go ask your coach,” Coleman said with a laugh.\n\nHis Tennessee Aquatics coach, Larry Hough, thinks he is doing just fine – in and out of the pool.\n\n“I would describe Coleman as a very happy person, one with a big personality and an exuberance for life,” said Hough, who knows a little about combining swimming and music as a former opera singer. “He is a very charismatic leader in the program; he leads both vocally and in deeds.”\n\nHe also said Coleman is a great competitor, who has never backed down from the opportunity to race, and wants to be the very best swimmer he can be.\n\nThis ambition has evidently carried over to the classroom as well. In fact, with three Ivy League schools on his college list, he has obviously had to burn the midnight oil along with a few calories.\n\nKredich said the International Baccalaureate program at West has really helped him. “That really prepares me for college,” he said. “All the classes are like college. I feel like I am really going to be ready.”\n\nKredich said he will likely pursue a career in finance or business due to his interest in math and working with numbers. But he has not completely ruled out following in his father’s footsteps as a coach, either.\n\n“That is definitely a possibility,” he said. “I do have a lot of respect for coaches and find it interesting.”\n\nFor now, though, he keeps pretty busy focusing on the present. Besides his academics, he also practices nine times a week when he is not participating in a meet. That includes twice a day on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, and Wednesday morning, Friday afternoon and Saturday morning.\n\nThat might sound like a grinding schedule, but Kredich said he enjoys it.\n\n“When we have Wednesday night off, I don’t know what to do with myself,” he joked.\n\nSOUTH\n\nHearts sad as Chapman Pool closes after 60 years\n\nHeather Robinson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nMembers of Chapman Pool are saddened by the news that their summer destination has closed the gates for the last time.\n\nThis month, the board tearfully came to the decision to sell the property at 608 E. Gov. John Sevier Highway and close the pool that served area families for almost 60 years.\n\nThe notice of the sale, posted on the pool’s Facebook page, shocked many people. It gained attention from members past and present, as well as those who never held membership but wished they had. Before the quick sale of the property, community members hoped there was something they could do to help, but it was too late. The pool had been in financial struggle for years.\n\nThe property sold this week for the asking price of $199,999, but representatives of the pool would not disclose the buyer or their intent for the property.\n\n“It breaks my heart,” says Carissa Mitchell, board president of Chapman Pool. “Sometimes very difficult decisions have to be made.”\n\nThe sale caused deep sadness and made generations of families nostalgic for the memories the property holds.\n\n“I will miss having a great place for my kids to play,” says Mitchell. “I felt like the facility was perfect for kids. There were days that we would stay for hours and lots of people would spend the whole day.”\n\nThe pool, which was built in the 1960s, operated as a nonprofit and relied on memberships to generate revenue that was used toward maintenance and repairs. After suffering financial hardship for several seasons, the board decided it would sell the property and refund any prepaid memberships. Money left over from the deal would be donated to the local schools where their membership derived.\n\n“The silver lining is that a few local elementary schools will be receiving a donation from the sale of the pool,” says Mitchell. “(It's) a final effort by the board and the founders of Chapman Pool to be a benefit to the community of South Knoxville.”\n\n“I want people to know that we did try and we tried everything we could,” says Mitchell. “We did not come to this decision lightly, or quickly. We spent thousands of hours and thousands of our own dollars to stay afloat.”\n\nIn addition to the high cost of maintaining a pool as old as Chapman Pool, memberships have dwindled over the last decade.\n\n“We just couldn’t keep up with the changes in how families choose to spend their free time, nor are pools designed to last nearly 60 years,” says Mitchell.\n\nAsked what the future holds for the property that currently houses an Olympic-size pool with a high dive, a kiddie pool, a gazebo and a lovely lawn, Mitchell is unsure.\n\n“I don’t know what will happen to the property,” says Mitchell. “I pray for a pool or recreation facility to continue.”\n\nTime will tell what becomes of the property, but for those who cherished this pool, hope remains that it can still be used for the good of the community.\n\nNORTH/EAST\n\n‘Lady Bosses of Knoxville’ at the Hive\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe Hive on Central Avenue was abuzz recently when Lady Bosses of Knoxville held one of their every-other-month lunch programs.\n\nGuests ate green salad, grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, rolls and brownies; sweet and not-sweet tea was offered. The vibe was energetic and engaged.\n\nBegun in June of 2017, the lunches grew out of a desire for women to gather and trade personal and professional ideas. “We just wanted to bring women of any stage in their career together with other women who’ve reached their goals, to see it could be done,” says Hannah Houser, community event planner for the Hive. “We’ve even had a couple of guys come, which is cool. They’re here to listen and learn.”\n\nSo far the group has enjoyed programs on Creatives, Foodies, Home & Lifestyle and Branding. This time the topic was Activism. Featured were Claudia Caballero, executive director of Centro Hispano; Katie Willocks, senior case manager for Bridge Refugee Services; Ghada Ayesh, teacher and daycare director at Annoor Academy; and Jessica Dean, professor of English at Pellissippi State Community College.\n\nDean says her activism began when she was a church secretary in North Carolina and she found people excluded — specifically residents of a nearby work-release halfway house who were looking for a church. This instance, she says, awakened her passion for “looking to the people at the margins — those who aren’t being included.” She spoke of the importance of listening to those in need, instead of going into a situation and trying to impose already-decided-upon actions. “What don’t I know? What don’t I see?”\n\nAyesh became involved in founding Annoor Academy because her own kids needed a place to feel safe and not “different” observing their religious customs while receiving an education. In 2015, she was named an Exceptional Educator by the Knoxville News Sentinel for her work with preschool students. “In the past two years I’ve found myself wanting to connect more” outside the school, she says. “My job now is trying to encourage the youth to give back to the community.”\n\nCaballero’s advice is, “Don’t be afraid to rock the boat. Change doesn’t happen unless you do that. You have to be persistent in life.” Willocks agrees. “As women, we’re taught to take a back seat. Instead, be the ‘Alexander Hamilton’ who annoys everyone.”\n\nAll spoke of the first step in creating a positive difference in the community: finding one’s passion.\n\nDean’s passion also extends to agriculture. As CEO of Clay Halo Farms & Kitchen, she employs college students as part of her Community-Supported Agriculture Apprentice program. “I started with a mint plant on my porch in college,” says Dean. “I killed three mint plants. And now I have a small farm.” She grins. “So watch out!”\n\nPOWELL\n\nProject or party, Rusty Cottage has all you need to DIY\n\nMike Blackerby, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThey take their home-craft projects seriously at the Rusty Cottage DIY Studio.\n\nIn fact, the motto for anything constructed at the popular Powell do-it-yourself workshop could very well be “Built to Last.”\n\nRusty Cottage, in Lambert Square at 6910 Clinton Hwy., opened in August.\n\nOwner Jamie Spickard holds workshops, private events and parties for DIY enthusiasts of all levels.\n\nEven if you don’t know how to hammer a nail or operate a power tool, Spickard will show you.\n\n“A lot of people don’t even know how to paint when they come in,” said Spickard with a laugh.\n\nShe decided to open her own business after doing DIY home projects for more than 20 years.\n\n“We were actually doing home-craft classes for friends out of our home and it got too big,” Spickard explained.\n\nDIY participants learn to make many of the same farmhouse-style wood signs and home-décor items that Spickard makes and sells out of her shop.\n\n“I cut out everything and make it myself,” she said. “The most popular things we have are home signs, door hangers and blanket ladders.”\n\nSpickard said there are several reasons why people are turning to DIY projects instead of buying home-décor items from more traditional stores.\n\n“They can personalize their home décor and projects and make it fit their homes,” she offered. “Also, a lot of people come in to make gifts for weddings, showers and house warmings.”\n\nAnd of course, the final products that come out of DIY projects at Rusty Cottage are built to last.\n\n“This is solid wood,” said Spickard, pointing to one of her wall hangings.\n\n“We use a lot of birch, plywood, pine and cedar. All of our porch signs are made of cedar to last long because they’re going to be hanging outside.”\n\nYou can tell that Rusty Cottage is a workshop.\n\nIn addition to the finished products that hang on the walls and adorn the shop, various workshops are scattered throughout. Stacks of wood, tools and paint are just waiting to be transformed into that special home project.\n\n“I’ve got people that come in two to three times a month to make gifts,” said Spickard.\n\nEverything you need to pull off your DIY project is provided in the classes.\n\n“When you come to the workshop you pick out what you want to make,” explained Spickard, who carries 70 colors of paint.\n\n“Everything you need is laid out for you. We have your smock, stains, paints, brushes and tools already laid out. We could have 30 people making 30 different projects.”\n\nSpickard is excited about an upcoming workshop.\n\n“We’ll be making cornhole boards in the spring.”\n\nSpickard said there are usually at least “two or three” DIY instructors on hand for the classes, which can handle a maximum of 34 people.\n\n“It gets a little crazy sometimes. It’s just a way for people to get together and have fun. People can bring wine, beer and order pizza.”\n\nTo inquire about upcoming workshops or book a private party, call 865-859-9282 or visit www.rustycottagetn.com.\n\nOPINION\n\nPeople and pets: Our hearts beat together\n\nLeslie Snow, Shopper News columnist\n\nI was juggling too many things at once. I had work to do and bills to pay. I had to pack for an upcoming trip and work through some construction problems for our remodeling project. My phone kept ringing. The kids kept texting. I had errands to run and groceries to buy. I was tired and tense. I felt the weight of a thousand little problems that amounted to nothing but still felt like a burden.\n\nThen I looked at my Great Dane, Lily, and saw the walnut-sized lump on her jaw. I put aside my computer and my papers. I tossed my to-do list aside and put my house plans on the counter. I dropped everything I was doing to take Lily to see our veterinarian.\n\nShe was miserable on the ride over. I could feel her hot breath on my neck. I could hear her heavy panting and see her soft fur flying round the car. I opened the back windows and tried to soothe her with my voice. “You’re OK, big girl. No one is going to hurt you.” I could tell she didn’t believe me.\n\nShe was even more anxious at the vet’s office. Her body was shaking. And like most Great Danes do, she leaned against me for comfort. I wrapped my arms around her body.\n\nThe vet came in a few minutes later and confirmed what I already suspected. Lily had an abscessed tooth. Her gums were red and swollen; she was in pain. While I waited for her prescriptions, I stroked her ears and rubbed her belly. She pressed herself against me so hard, I could barely keep my balance.\n\nOn the way home, she kept her face next to mine so she could lick my cheek and nibble my ear while I drove. She whined, softly. And in a strange flashback, I thought of taking my kids to see the pediatrician when their throats were sore and their fevers were high.\n\nWhen we got back home, Lily raced to her bed and plopped down with a groan. She was ready to relax, but I was too wound up to settle down. The stress of the day washed over me. My papers were just where I left them. My shopping list was still waiting. My to do-list was staring at me. The construction problems I had put on hold to take Lily to the vet hadn’t resolved themselves in my absence.\n\nI looked at Lily, curled in the tiniest ball a Great Dane can manage, and I smiled. Without giving it much thought, I walked over to her bed and scooted down next to her. I rested my head against her soft body and let her warmth comfort me.\n\nShe made her happiest noises then and turned her head until our faces were touching. Her breathing slowed and so did mine. She sighed contentedly and so did I. We closed our eyes.\n\nI felt the stress fall away from us. And if I had been her mother earlier in the day, caring for her when she was sick, she was my friend now helping to ease the burdens of an ordinary day that, for some reason, didn’t feel ordinary at all.\n\nWe fell asleep like that, and when I woke up a few minutes later, I felt better. We both got what we needed on that stressful day. And though Lily couldn’t say so, I think we were both grateful for the ties that bind us together.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snowcolumn@aol.com.\n\nHALLS/FOUNTAIN CITY\n\nCHS Alumni Association presents check to Central High School", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/26"}]}

The company is scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.\n\nBeyond the double-barrel challenges of shortages of raw materials and inflation, issues like the continuing pandemic, the war in Ukraine and climate change are adding to the uncertainty.\n\n“It has been very hard,” Patricio said. “This has been hard for the entire industry.”\n\nPatricio said Kraft Heinz (KHC) has tried “to minimize inflation on everything we do” because “it would be very easy just to pass the price to consumers, but that has consequences.”\n\nSo to keep costs low for the end consumer, Patricio said his company has had to be “much more efficient in our factories” and careful about procurement costs.\n\nKraft Heinz has also leaned into different packaging and pricing options for consumers, including bulk value packs of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese and wider variety of bottle sizes for products like Heinz ketchup for shoppers who want smaller, lower-priced choices.\n\n“It’s a constant fight to try to minimize price increases,” Patricio said.\n\nPart of that fight is Patricio’s “obsessive” tracking of potential supply chain issues. Almost three years of challenges have trained the company to predict where a snag will occur and respond quickly.\n\n“Every day we have a new problem. It’s the new normal,” he said. “At the beginning we thought it was a crisis — now we know it’s a new normal and we have to adapt to that.” He later added: “If you predict that that’s gonna be a problem, you can go faster. If you adapt faster, you can win. And this is what we’re trying to do.”\n\nThose supply issues are broader than the Covid era, however. A crushing three-year drought has led to a shortage of tomatoes, for example.\n\n“Every day there’s a shortage of something,” Patricio said. “It doesn’t help [that] with the global warming that the crops have not been good. So there’s lack of tomatoes in the world, there’s lack of potatoes in the world, there’s lack of beans in the world.”\n\nDespite that tomato shortage, Patricio vows Heinz ketchup will stay on the shelves as usual.\n\n“We predicted that we would have a problem with the crop of tomatoes,” he said, “so we bought them in advance.”", "authors": ["Christine Romans"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/business/russian-oligarchs-yachts-invs/index.html", "title": "Biden is vowing to seize Russian oligarchs' yachts. Here's where ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe ships span the length of a football field or longer, come outfitted with helipads and swimming pools, and have shown up at ports around the world – towering over nearby fishing vessels and motorboats like giants.\n\nYachts owned by Russian oligarchs – who have bought some of the largest and most extravagant “superyachts” on the planet – are gleaming symbols of how Russia’s elite have profited under the government of President Vladimir Putin.\n\nNow, as Russian forces ramp up their deadly military campaign in Ukraine, the yachts are emerging as key targets of the US and European allies, who are vowing to seize property owned by Putin’s enablers.\n\nDisputes are already erupting: French officials seized a yacht Wednesday night that they said was linked to Igor Sechin, a sanctioned Russian oil executive and close Putin associate, as it was preparing to flee a port. But the company that manages the ship denied Sechin was the owner. And the White House said German officials had seized another oligarch’s yacht in Hamburg, while local authorities denied any ships had been confiscated.\n\nThe French seizure shows that confiscating oligarchs’ yachts will require a concerted global effort – and it’s likely to mean protracted legal battles around the world, experts said.\n\nA CNN review of maritime location data from the website MarineTraffic found that more than a dozen yachts that have been reported to be owned by Russian oligarchs are spread out across the world, from the crystal waters of Antigua to ports in Barcelona and Hamburg to atolls in the Maldives and Seychelles.\n\nIn several cases, the billionaires’ yachts have been on the move in the days since the Russian offensive began.\n\nMeanwhile, officials around the world are also enforcing sanctions on a far less flashy but still important group of vessels: oil tankers and container ships the US Treasury Department says are owned by the subsidiary of a bank with close ties to Russia’s defense industry. French authorities intercepted one of the cargo ships last weekend, and a Malaysian port refused to let another dock.\n\nSanctions and asset seizures “make it more difficult for the Kremlin to persuade capable people of getting involved in its activities and thereby weaken the grip of the Kremlin over elites,” said William Courtney, a former US ambassador and current executive director of the RAND Business Leaders Forum, whose members include Russian and Western leaders.\n\nPresident Joe Biden put the Russian elite on notice in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night.\n\n“To the Russian oligarchs and the corrupt leaders who bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime: No more,” Biden declared. “We are joining with European allies to find and seize their yachts, their luxury apartments, their private jets. We’re coming for your ill-begotten gains.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'He has no idea what's coming': Biden sends message to Putin 02:36 - Source: CNN\n\nThe US Department of Justice launched a new task force – dubbed KleptoCapture – to help put Biden’s words into action. The effort includes prosecutors, federal agents and experts in money laundering, tax enforcement and national security investigations from the FBI, the IRS, the US Marshals Service, and the US Postal Inspection Service, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n“We will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute those whose criminal acts enable the Russian government to continue this unjust war,” Garland said.\n\nRussian-tied yachts docked around the world\n\nYacht ownership is extremely difficult to confirm, with the ships often registered to management companies or shell corporations in an apparent effort to disguise ownership, experts say.\n\nBut more than a dozen of the billionaires included in a list of Russian “oligarchs” the Treasury Department released in 2018 have been tied to yachts in media reports in recent years, according to a CNN review.\n\nMost of the oligarchs who reportedly own yachts are not yet facing US sanctions. However, some have been sanctioned by the European Union or the United Kingdom, and could be added to US sanctions lists as well.\n\nAmber Vitale, a former official with the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces sanctions, said that US sanctions generally only prevent Americans and American companies from interacting with sanctioned individuals. That means the oligarchs’ yachts could be safe from seizure if they stay in international waters or in countries that haven’t issued their own sanctions.\n\n“However, it would get very difficult to operate for long if many allied nations impose similar prohibitions,” Vitale said in an email. “Vessels need ports, fuel, operators/captains, repairs and supplies. Without access to these things they could be stuck floating at sea waiting for rescue or resolution.”\n\nThe seizures have already begun, with French officials taking the Amore Vero, the yacht they said is owned by Sechin, according to a statement from France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance. The yacht arrived at the French port of La Ciotat on January 3 for repairs, but was “making arrangements to sail urgently, without having completed the planned work” when it was seized on Wednesday, the ministry said. Sechin, the CEO of the Russian oil company Rosneft, was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Rosneft itself was sanctioned by the US in 2014.\n\nThe Amore Vero yacht at a shipyard in La Ciotat, in southern France, on March 3, 2022. Nicolas Tucat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut a yacht management company associated with the ship denied Sechin owned it. “I can absolutely say that Igor Sechin is not the owner,” a spokesperson for Imperial Yachts, which manages the Amore Vero, told CNN. “The rightful owner is appealing the decision to seize the vessel.”\n\nLegal experts told CNN that oligarchs were likely to transfer assets such as yachts to friends or family who aren’t sanctioned to try to prevent them from being seized. Catherine Belton, the author of a book on Putin, said she expected oligarchs were “feverishly engineering deals where ownership changes could be triggered.”\n\n“It’s going to be a game of cat and mouse,” she said.\n\nThe French ministry said that the Amore Vero, which has an onboard gym and beauty salon and won an award for yacht design, is owned by a company whose “main shareholder” is Sechin. Sechin served as Russia’s deputy prime minister in Putin’s cabinet before becoming CEO of Rosneft, one of the country’s largest companies, in 2012.\n\nThe seizure may also scare other Russian oligarchs into getting their ships out of EU ports. The Dilbar, one of the largest yachts in the world, which is reportedly owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, arrived in Hamburg, Germany in late October, according to MarineTraffic data. There was confusion about the ship’s status on Thursday: Usmanov was sanctioned by the EU earlier this week, and Forbes reported that German authorities had seized the 156-meter ship, which can carry up to 96 crew members and 24 guests. The US Treasury Department also sanctioned Usmanov on Thursday, specifically calling out the Dilbar as evidence of his “luxurious lifestyle.”\n\nBut a spokesperson for the Hamburg economic authority told CNN Thursday that “no yacht has been seized by authorities or customs at the port in Hamburg at this moment in time.” German customs officials did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, and the shipbuilding company that reportedly had been refitting the yacht declined to comment.\n\nA file photo dated September 10, 2018 shows the yacht Dilbar. Sabri Kesen/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe Luna, a yacht reportedly owned by Farkhad Akhmedov, an Azerbaijani billionaire who previously led a Russian natural gas company, was also in Hamburg as of the latest MarineTraffic data from earlier this week. Akhmedov, who has not been sanctioned, kept the nine-deck, 115-meter Luna after an acrimonious divorce that was the largest divorce case heard in Britain’s legal history. The yacht features missile detection technology and bulletproof windows.\n\nSeveral yachts reportedly owned by Russian oligarchs have been docked at a port in Barcelona, including the Solaris, which has been tied to Roman Abramovich, the billionaire who announced Wednesday that he would sell the Chelsea Football Club and donate proceeds to a foundation for people impacted by the invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich hasn’t been sanctioned.\n\nThe Galactica Super Nova, reportedly owned by Russian oil company executive Vagit Alekperov, left Barcelona on Saturday and crossed the Mediterranean to Tivat, Montenegro, before sailing south into the Adriatic Sea. While Alekperov hasn’t been sanctioned, he is president of Lukoil, which has been hit by US sanctions in the past.\n\nOther Russian-linked yachts are in the Caribbean, including Eclipse, another yacht owned by Abramovich, which is among the world’s largest and includes a swimming pool that can be transformed into a dance floor, and the Anna, reportedly owned by oligarch Dmitry Rybolovlev, who once purchased a Florida mansion from former President Donald Trump. Rybolovlev hasn’t been sanctioned.\n\nCourtney, the former ambassador, said that he expected Russian oligarchs took most of their assets out of the US after two billionaires were sanctioned in 2018, and predicted that they would try to move their yachts out of Western European countries to avoid them being seized.\n\n“We are likely to see more of a redistribution geographically of some of those assets,” Courtney said, to countries “that are seen as less likely to sanction,” possibly in the Middle East.\n\nSeveral yachts connected to Russian oligarchs have arrived in recent weeks in the Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago nation. They include the Clio, reportedly owned by oligarch Oleg Deripaska, which left Sri Lanka in early February and has been sailing between various Maldives atolls since then, according to MarineTraffic. Deripaska was sanctioned by the US in 2018.\n\nNone of the oligarchs mentioned in this story responded to requests for comment from CNN sent to their spokespeople, businesses or lawyers.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of a yacht with supposed ties to the Russian elite fleeing the West is a Russian-flagged ship named Graceful. Speculative news articles in the German media have reported that the ship belongs to Putin himself, although there’s no concrete evidence that that’s the case.\n\nGraceful departed Hamburg in early February – roughly two weeks before the invasion of Ukraine – and sped to Kaliningrad, Russia, the MarineTraffic data shows. No location data has been recorded since it arrived in the Russian city on February 9.\n\nHackers last week successfully altered maritime traffic data to make it appear that the yacht’s destination was “hell” and it had run aground on Snake Island in Ukraine – where Ukrainian soldiers’ profane response to a Russian warship went viral on social media.\n\nSanctions will likely spark legal battles over the yachts, and require government officials to prove ownership, experts said.\n\n“A sanctioned person may say to the government that the asset you have frozen is not one of my assets,” arguing that it is registered in a family member’s name or a shell corporation that has not specifically been sanctioned, said Raj Bhala, a professor at the University of Kansas Law School and a sanctions expert. “The oligarch could argue before the government that you don’t really have the legal authority to seize my asset.”\n\nBut there are new dangers for the oligarchs’ yachts beyond legal proceedings: A Ukrainian ship engineer was arrested in the Spanish island of Mallorca for trying to sink a yacht owned by a Russian military export company executive, local news outlets reported.\n\n“I don’t regret anything I’ve done and I would do it again,” the engineer declared in court on Sunday, according to the Majorca Daily Bulletin. “They were attacking innocents.”\n\nSanctioned shipping vessels seized, blocked from ports\n\nEven as Biden and other officials have focused their public comments on oligarchs’ yachts, the US is also going after other shipping vessels with ties to Russia.\n\nLast week, the Biden administration announced sanctions against five oil, cargo and container ships that the Treasury Department says are owned by a subsidiary of Promsvyazbank, a Russian bank that has given billions of dollars to support Russian defense companies. The sanctions block any Americans from doing business with Promsvyazbank.\n\nFrench authorities seized one of the cargo ships, the Baltic Leader, on Saturday as it was headed from France to Saint Petersburg, Russia, “as part of an operation carried out in cooperation with US authorities,” according to France’s finance ministry. The ship is now anchored at a port in northern France, MarineTraffic data shows.\n\nA port operator in Malaysia declined the request of one of the other vessels, an oil tanker named Linda, to dock there on March 5 “in order not to violate any sanctions,” Malaysia’s Ministry of Transport told CNN. The decision was first reported by Reuters.\n\nPromsvyazbank did not respond to CNN’s request for comment, but has publicly denied that its subsidiary owned the Linda, and said it no longer owns the Baltic Leader. Two of the other US-sanctioned ships are now in the process of having their leases withdrawn from Promsvyazbank’s subsidiary, according to a statement from Russian company FESCO Transportation Group.\n\nSome of the ships have been accused in recent years of violating past US sanctions by transporting Iranian oil. A Turkish petroleum company had agreed to service another one of the ships – an oil tanker named Pegas – at one of its terminals earlier this year, but after receiving a report that the ship may have been carrying Iranian cargo, the transaction was canceled, according to a spokesperson for the company, Opet.", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Curt Devine Daniel A.

She was featured on the nation’s banknotes for more than 60 years, the first British monarch to do so. Her portrait also features on the currency of several countries that were formerly under British rule.\n\nSince 1953, one year after the Queen took the throne, UK coins have borne five different versions of her portrait. She appeared on the country’s banknotes starting in 1960.\n\nBut now, the Bank of England, which prints the country’s banknotes, and the Royal Mint, which makes its coins, face the sizeable task of withdrawing that currency from circulation and replacing it with money bearing the portrait of King Charles III.\n\nThere are more than 4.7 million banknotes in circulation in the UK, worth a collective £82 billion ($95 billion), according to the central bank. There are also around 29 billion coins circulating, the Royal Mint said.\n\nThe new money is likely to introduced gradually, and coexist as legal tender with the old notes and coins for a period of time.\n\nA similar phase-in happened in 2017, when the Royal Mint began issuing a new 12-sided £1 coin. The new coin circulated at the same time as the old round-shaped £1 for six months before the latter lost its status as legal tender.\n\nBut it’s not just cash that will require a makeover. The UK faces a mammoth operation to change the royal insignia on thousands of post boxes and newly issued passports.\n\nNo changes yet\n\nThe Royal Mint said in a statement on its website that coins bearing the image of the Queen “remain legal tender and in circulation,” and that their production would continue as usual during “this period of respectful mourning.”\n\nThe Bank of England said that the Queen’s “iconic portraits [were] synonymous” with some of its most important work.\n\n“Current banknotes featuring the image of Her Majesty The Queen will continue to be legal tender,” it said in a Thursday statement. (At one point Friday, so many people were attempting to access the Royal Mint’s website that there was a virtual queue to get in.)\n\nThe central bank said it would lay out its plans to replace existing banknotes once the period of mourning ends. The Royal Mint also said that it would make an announcement in due course.\n\nThe Queen’s image is also emblazoned on some banknotes and coins across the Commonwealth — an association of 54 countries, almost all of which were formerly colonized by the UK.\n\nIn Canada, where the Queen remains the head of state, her image features on plastic $20 banknotes.\n\n“The current polymer $20 bank note is intended to circulate for years to come. There is no legislative requirement to change the design within a prescribed period when the Monarch changes,” Amélie Ferron-Craig, a spokesperson for the Bank of Canada, said in a statement to CNN Business.\n\nCanada’s finance minster is responsible for approving the design of new banknotes, Ferron-Craig added, and issuing those notes usually takes a few years.\n\nIn Australia, too, the Queen’s portrait features on the $5 note. The Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday that there would be no “immediate change” to its banknotes.\n\nIt added that its $5 notes would “not be withdrawn” and would likely stay in circulation for years.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/economy/china-russia-closer-ties-sco-summit-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "3 ways China and Russia are forging much closer economic ties ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, will meet face-to-face this week for the first time since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine earlier this year.\n\nWhen they last met, in February in Beijing during the Winter Olympics, they proclaimed their friendship had “no limits.” Since then, Russia has sought ever closer ties with China as Europe and the United States responded to the invasion with wave after wave of sanctions.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping, right, and Russian President Vladimir Putin pose for a photo at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Qingdao in eastern China's Shandong Province on June 10, 2018. Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP\n\nBeijing has carefully avoided violating Western sanctions or providing direct military support to Moscow. This balancing act, experts say, is a sign that Xi won’t sacrifice China’s economic interests to rescue Putin, who arrived at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Uzbekistan this week with his army retreating from large swathes of Ukrainian territory.\n\nBut the trading relationship is booming, in a lopsided way, as Russia desperately seeks new markets and China — an economy 10 times the size — scrambles for cheap commodities.\n\nTrade in bilateral goods is at record levels as China snaps up oil and coal to tackle an energy crisis. Russia, meanwhile, has become a top market for China’s currency, and Chinese companies are rushing to fill the vacuum left by departing Western brands.\n\nRecord trade\n\nChina’s spending on Russian goods soared 60% in August from a year ago, hitting $11.2 billion, according to Chinese customs statistics, surpassing July’s 49% gain.\n\nIts shipments to Russia, meanwhile, jumped 26% to $8 billion in August, also accelerating from the previous month.\n\nFor the first eight months of this year, total goods trade between China and Russia surged 31% to $117.2 billion. That’s already 80% of last year’s total — which stood at a record $147 billion.\n\n“Russia needs China more than China needs Russia,” said Keith Krach, former Under Secretary of State for Economic growth, Energy and the Environment in the United States.\n\n“As the war in Ukraine drags on, Putin’s losing friends fast and increasingly becoming more and more dependent on China,” he added.\n\nFor China, Russia now accounts for 2.8% of its total trade volume, slightly higher than the 2.5% share at the end of last year. The European Union and United States have much bigger shares.\n\nChina was already Russia’s largest single trading partner before the war, and accounted for 16% of its total foreign trade.\n\nBut the world’s second biggest economy has assumed much greater significance for Russia, which has plunged into a recession because of the Western sanctions.\n\nThe Russian central bank stopped publishing detailed trade data when the war in Ukraine started. But Bruegel, a European economic think tank, analyzed statistics from Russia’s top 34 trading partners recently and estimated that China accounted for roughly 24% of Russia’s exports in June.\n\n“China-Russia trade is booming because China is taking advantage of the Ukraine crisis to buy Russian energy at a discount and replace Western firms that have exited the market,” said Neil Thomas, a senior analyst on China at Eurasia Group.\n\nRussia displaced Saudi Arabia in May as the top supplier of oil to China. Moscow has held onto that top spot for three straight months through July, according to the latest Chinese customs data.\n\nChina’s coal imports from Russia also hit a five-year high of 7.42 million metric tons in July.\n\nCoal in freight wagons ahead of shipping at Tomusinskaya railway station near Mezhdurechensk, Russia, on Monday, July 19, 2021. Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nYuan the new dollar in Russia?\n\nThe Ukraine war has also sent demand for the Chinese yuan soaring in Russia, as Western sanctions largely cut Moscow off from global financial system and restricted its access to the dollar and euro.\n\nYuan trade on the Moscow stock exchange amounted to 20% of the total trading volumes by major currencies in July, up from no more than 0.5% in January, according to Russian news media outlet Kommersant.\n\nDaily trading volumes in the yuan-ruble exchange rate also hit a new record last month, surpassing ruble-dollar trade for the first time in history, according to Russian state-controlled media RT.\n\nAccording to statistics published by SWIFT, the messaging system used by financial institutions globally to process international payments, Russia was the third biggest market in the world for payments made in yuan outside mainland China in July, after Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The country didn’t even appear on SWIFT’s list of top 15 yuan markets in February.\n\nRussian companies and banks are also increasingly turning to the yuan for international payments.\n\nLast week, Russia’s Gazprom said it would start billing China in yuan and ruble for natural gas supplies, while Russia’s VTB bank said it was launching money transfers to China in yuan.\n\nFor Beijing, it’s a boost to its ambitions to make the yuan a global currency.\n\n“Increased Russian use of the yuan also helps to inch forward China’s long-term goals to make the redback a global currency, to insulate itself from Western financial sanctions, and to enhance its institutional power in international finance,” said Thomas from Eurasia Group.\n\nFor Russia, this partnership with China “is born of desperation,” said Krach.\n\n“Because Russia has been severely weakened, in part by sanctions, Putin is willing to do a deal with a predatory power so long as it gains access to capital,” he added.\n\nChinese companies fill the vacuum\n\nChinese companies are also taking advantage of the exodus of Western brands from Russia.\n\nChinese smartphones accounted for two-thirds of all new sales in Russia between April and June, Reuters reported, citing Russia’s top electronics retailer M.Video-Eldorado. Their total share in Russia has steadily increased from 50% in the first quarter, to 60% in April, and then to more than 70% in June, M.Video said.\n\nXiaomi was the best-selling smartphone maker in Russia in July, holding 42% of the market, according to Russian media Kommersant.\n\nSamsung (SSNLF), once the market leader, had only 8.5% of the market in July. Apple (AAPL) held 7%. The two companies accounted for almost half of the Russian market prior to the Ukraine invasion, but suspended sales of new products in the country after the war began.\n\nChinese cars have also flooded Russia.\n\nPassenger cars from Chinese manufacturers accounted for almost 26% of Russia’s market in August, the highest on record, according to Russian analytical agency Autostat. That compares with just 9.5% in the first quarter.\n\nMajor global auto players, including Ford and Toyota, have pulled back from Russia this year.\n\nLimits in ‘no limits’ partnership\n\nBut there are also significant limits in the China-Russia partnership, analysts said.\n\nChina is not providing military, commercial, or technological support that would “risk significant US sanctions on China,” said Thomas at Eurasia Group.\n\n“Beijing will not sacrifice its own economic interests to support Moscow,” he said.\n\nFearing a US backlash, China has so far “steadfastly” refused to violate international sanctions against Russia, forcing Moscow to request military support from North Korea, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the DC-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n“Beijing’s refusal to violate US and international sanctions reflects its begrudging acceptance that China remains reliant on Western capital and technology to sustain its ongoing development, even though Xi is personally inclined to assist Putin’s war effort,” he said.\n\nMoreover, China’s rapid economic slowdown this year will further constrain Xi’s willingness to help Putin. The Chinese president won’t want to risk anything that further destabilizes the economy mere weeks before he’s poised to secure an historic third term at the Communist Party’s congress.\n\nWhat the future holds\n\nFuture relations will likely remained strained, and China will want to keep its options open, analysts said.\n\n“There’s always been mistrust between the two regimes, which historically treated each other as rivals,” Krach noted.\n\nThe current Sino-Russia partnership is mainly a “defensive” one, enhanced by Beijing and Moscow’s shared view that NATO and the United States pose a “palpable national security threat,” said Susan Thornton, senior fellow and visiting lecturer at Yale Law School.\n\n“Russia’s war in Ukraine is not in China’s interest, but given Western hostility, China will not oppose Russia,” she added.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/media/china-new-internet-rule-punish-liking-posts-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "China to punish internet users for 'liking' posts in crackdown after ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nInternet users in China will soon be held liable for liking posts deemed illegal or harmful, sparking fears that the world’s second largest economy plans to control social media like never before.\n\nChina’s internet watchdog is stepping up its regulation of cyberspace as authorities intensify their crackdown on online dissent amid growing public anger against the country’s stringent Covid restrictions.\n\nThe new rules come into force from Dec. 15, as part of a new set of guidelines published by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) earlier this month. The CAC operates under the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission chaired by leader Xi Jinping.\n\nThe new rules have gained attention on social media in recent days and will take effect just weeks after an unprecedented wave of public anger started sweeping the country. From Beijing to Shanghai, thousands of demonstrators protested in more than a dozen cities over the weekend, demanding an end to the country’s draconian Covid restrictions and calling for political freedoms.\n\nInternet users are taking screenshots of content related to the protests to preserve them and using coded references in messages to evade censors, while the authorities are scrambling to scrub the internet of dissent.\n\nThe regulation is an updated version of one previously published in 2017.

The authorities must have been really spooked when so many people in so many cities came out at the same time,” he added.\n\nVery concerned\n\nAnalysts said the new regulation was a sign that authorities were stepping up their crackdown on dissent.\n\n“The authorities are very concerned with the spreading protest activities, and an important means of control is to stop the communications of the potential protesters including reports of protest activities and appeals of joining them,” said Joseph Cheng, a retired professor of political science at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\n“This cyberspace control is an important lesson absorbed from protest activities like the Arab Spring,” he said, referring to protests that washed over Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Bahrain and the eastern province of Saudi Arabia in 2011.\n\n“What is important to note is that in the wake of the [China] protests, we will likely see more aggressive policing of Chinese cyberspace, especially if the protests expand,” said Isaac Stone Fish, founder and CEO of Strategy Risks, a China risk consultancy firm based in New York.\n\nIn recent years, China has gradually intensified its censorship of social media and other online platforms, including launching crackdowns on financial blogs and unruly fan culture. This year, the country’s strict zero-Covid policy and Xi’s securing of a historic third term have sparked discontent and anger among many online users.\n\nBut under the increasingly strict internet censorship, many voices of dissent have been silenced.\n\nMore rules\n\nAccording to the regulation, all online sites are required to verify users’ real identities before allowing them to submit comments or like posts. Users have to be verified by providing their personal ID, mobile phone, or social credit numbers.\n\nAll online platforms must set up a “vetting and editing team” for real-time monitoring, reporting, or deleting content. In particular, comments on news stories must be reviewed by the sites before they can appear online.\n\nAll platforms also need to develop a credit rating system for users based on their comments and likes. Users with poor ratings dubbed “dishonest” will be added to a blocklist and banned from using the platform or registering new accounts.\n\nHowever, analysts also questioned how practical it would be to carry out the newest rules, given that public anger is widespread and strict enforcement of these censorship requirements would consume significant resources.\n\n“It is almost impossible to stop the spread of protest activities as the dissatisfaction continues to spread. The angry people can come up with all sorts of ways to communicate and express their feelings,” Cheng said. “The major deterrent lies in the perception that the (Communist) Party regime is still in control and the sanctions are severe.”\n\nChongyi Feng, an associate professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, said that it is “extremely difficult” now for the Chinese public to voice their grievances and anger.\n\n“Cyberspace policing by Chinese authorities is already beyond measure, but that does not stop brave Chinese citizens from challenging the regime,” he said.", "authors": ["Laura He"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/26/business/nightcap-pound-falls-truss-economics/index.html", "title": "The UK's 'Trussonomics' crashes the pound and leaves investors ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe reviews are in on the new UK government’s plan to slash taxes and load up on debt, and they are, um, far from glowing.\n\nHere’s the deal: The British pound tumbled to a record low against the US dollar on Monday as investors around the world dumped UK assets.\n\nFor the first time in history, the pound is on track to hit parity with the dollar before the end of the year. At its low point Monday, the British currency traded at $1.03 before stabilizing around $1.07. (For context, the pound has fallen from $1.34 at the start of the year.)\n\nPart of the pressure on the pound comes from the strong dollar, which has gotten a boost from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. (The dollar tends to strengthen in uncertain times, when investors are hungry for a place to park their money while riding economic shocks, like a pandemic. Or a war. Or inflation. Or all of the above, all at once.)\n\nBut the pound is also falling against the euro, signaling broader concerns about the UK’s financial health. Let’s dig a little deeper on that:\n\nRight now, the UK is looking less like a safe haven for investors because the British government is making a huge, frankly head-scratching wager on tax cuts that turns years of fiscal policy on its head.\n\nTo be clear, almost no one outside of the administration of Liz Truss, who replaced Boris Johnson as prime minister less than a month ago, agrees with her unorthodox, trickle-down-esque approach, known colloquially as Trussonomics.\n\nThe Truss economic theory goes that cutting taxes will help jump-start a stagnant economy and take the edge off any looming recession.\n\nBut, as critics of her plan have long noted, the policy will force the government to borrow heavily to pay for both the tax cuts and a state-run program to cap payments on consumers’ eye-watering energy bills that have plunged the country into a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nUnder the plan, all British households will see their income tax rates fall, and have their energy bills capped at an average of about $2,700 a year. But, as my colleague Anna Cooban writes, it will be the richest people who benefit most.\n\nCritically, the growth-focused goal of Trussonomics is fundamentally at odds with the inflation-fighting mission of the Bank of England.\n\nKey quote: “Serious questions are already being asked about the economic competency of the new government,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda.\n\n\n\nAs the pound nose-dived Monday, pressure rose on the Bank of England to intervene with an emergency rate hike to try to shore up confidence in the pound. While the bank did issue a statement saying it was watching the situation closely, it stopped short of an emergency hike.\n\nThe pound’s decline is a far bigger problem than just the significant headaches its causing among currency and bond traders.\n\nBritons are already struggling to pay for food and fuel as inflation hovers around 10%, and a weaker pound will only make those essentials more expensive.\n\n“This is a painful reminder that economic policy is not a game,” said Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on boosting living standards for low- to middle-income households.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe pound’s crash will make inflation worse and push interest rates higher.\n\nThe rich are the biggest winners of Britain’s tax-cutting gamble\n\nUS stocks fell yet again as currency market turmoil rattles investors\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n“When you’re younger, you can go out and get two or three jobs, you can hustle … But when you’re a senior, it’s tough to pivot.”\n\nThis is how Catherine Powell, a lifelong Clevelander, found herself back in the workforce at the age of 62, taking a part-time job helping other seniors apply for benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n\nThe Fed has warned about “pain” to come with rising interest rates, but seniors and others on fixed incomes are already living it, my colleague Martha C. White reports.\n\nEVERYTHING BUT BLING\n\nHow about some slightly cheerier news, eh mates? For that I turned to my colleague Parija Kavilanz, who reported today that we the people may finally get some price cuts just in time for the holidays.\n\nLong story short: Remember how pandemic-induced supply chain problems left store shelves empty and forced you to wait, like, almost a year for that new stove to arrive? Well, fast forward to now, those supply chains aren’t fully recovered but stores are now overloaded with crap they can’t sell because they assumed we’d all keep shopping out our anxieties like it was 2020 (inflation had other ideas).\n\nThat means the holidays are going to be all about deals. And sales are starting earlier than ever. Amazon just announced a second Prime Day event for mid-October; Target and Walmart are also kicking off holiday sales next month.\n\nBut there is at least one big, sparkling exception to the sales bonanza. The bling, baby.\n\nHoliday jewelry sales have been on fire for the past two years, Parija writes, and that puts the entire category in good shape, even with the sting of inflation. Jewelry is seen as a good investment, so people may opt for a quality over quantity approach to gift buying this year.\n\nIt also helps that there’s not, like, a must-have new phone or gaming console or trendy stationary bike competing to be the Big Gift.\n\nBottom line: Jewelry is always a winner for Christmas, in case anyone I live with is in need of ideas…", "authors": ["Allison Morrow"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/success/resume-writing-tips/index.html", "title": "The dos and don'ts of the modern resume | CNN Business", "text": "Your resume can be the first impression you make with a potential employer. So you want to put your best foot forward when crafting one.\n\n“This is a storytelling exercise about what makes you so compelling,” said Debra Wheatman, certified resume writer and career coach. “You need to look at this as a marketing tool for yourself. Take a step outside of yourself and ask how you want the world to perceive you.”\n\nHere’s what should and shouldn’t be part of your resume:\n\nDon’t: Get too fancy\n\nThe top of your resume is the most valuable real estate. So, make sure recruiters and hiring managers can easily find what they need.\n\n“A creative resume is working against you,” said Stacie Haller, a job search coach. “You have to get someone’s attention in six seconds and recruiters know where to look to get information and that’s where we want to find it. We don’t have time to figure you out.”\n\nShe advised including your name, the city and state you live in, your email, phone number, LinkedIn profile and a value statement/summary if you’ve been in the working world for a while.\n\nA summary at the top of your resume is a way of highlighting your skills and creating a brand for yourself.\n\nDo: Sum up your skills and brand\n\nThose who are new to the job world could lead with their education instead of a summary, Wheatman said, but if they want to include a summary she suggested it could be something like: Recent graduate with a degree in marketing and skills applicable to XYZ industry.\n\nShe added that early career job seekers can also tout their communication and collaboration skills.\n\nFor more seasoned workers, she advised having an executive summary that details the value you bring to a position or company, including examples of successes in your current or previous roles.\n\n“It’s a powerful brand statement with an example…think of it as: to this position I bring what,” she said. “You want something specific and measurable up there that is an immediate example of something you’ve done that illustrates how you drive results.”\n\nDon’t: Include an objective\n\nOne thing that shouldn’t be at the top of your resume: an objective.\n\n“Don’t tell a company what you are looking for, you need to share with them information about how you can impact their environment,” said Wheatman.\n\nDo: Write for the robots\n\nAdding the position you are applying for at the top can help get your resume past applicant tracking systems, according to Demisha Jennings, a certified resume writer.\n\nThese systems look for specific keywords to find potential candidates.\n\nShe suggested identifying the keywords used in a job description and making sure they are also included in your resume. Often the title of the position and required skills are some of the keywords the tracking systems are looking for, she explained.\n\n“If you don’t use those keywords and phrases from the position description, it’s harder to get past the applicant tracking system,” she said.\n\nDo: Be specific\n\nYou want to be clear with your experience and make sure to detail your skills and qualifications for a job.\n\n“Earlier in your career, on your resume you have to show what you know how to do,” said Haller. “Later in your career, you have to show what the value is of bringing you in as a senior leader.”\n\nShe added that describing quantifiable successes, whether it’s in regard to sales, growth, benchmarks or savings, can help show your impact and help attract more attention from recruiters.\n\n“The BS meters are out with resume reviewers…when [resumes] are very general you aren’t going to get a call,” she said.\n\nDon’t: Include anything and everything\n\nYour resume shouldn’t be a data dump of everything you’ve ever done.\n\nOne way to format your experience is to list the position, company and tenure followed by a few lines describing your role and then a few achievement-based bullet points with more specific details, suggested Jennings.\n\n“The bullet points should make you stand out,” she said. “The first few sentences highlight the stronger and more complex things you do in the role.”\n\nAnd list your bullet points in order of importance, suggested Haller. “Stack your bullet points with things you want people to see…[recruiters] are probably only reading the first one.”\n\nRecent grads that don’t have a lot of work or internship experience and are looking to fill out their resume can add volunteer involvement, related extracurricular activities, and applicable projects.\n\n“Just because you aren’t paid for something doesn’t mean it’s not work,” said Wheatman.\n\nDon’t: Lie or have mistakes\n\nIt’s okay not to have all the skills or requirements listed on a job posting, so don’t make untrue claims about yourself on your resume.\n\nAnd be sure to scrutinize your resume for any spelling or grammar errors before hitting send.\n\n“One error or typo on a resume might just take you out of the running,” said Haller. “Make sure somebody else looks at it.”", "authors": ["Kathryn Vasel"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/business/dirty-soda-pepsi/index.html", "title": "Pepsi wants you to drink soda mixed with milk this holiday season ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\n‘Tis the season to mix milk into your soda. According to Pepsi, anyway.\n\nPepsi launched a campaign Thursday encouraging customers to try the combination and use the hashtag #PilkandCookies (as in Pepsi plus milk) to showcase their Santa-friendly concoctions. Those who participate in the online challenge running through Christmas Day will have the chance to win cash.\n\n“Combining Pepsi and milk has long been a secret hack among Pepsi fans,” said Todd Kaplan, Pepsi’s chief marketing officer, in a statement about the campaign.\n\nPepsi is now publicizing the mix as its spin on “dirty soda,” a popular TikTok trend that combines soda with syrup and cream. Companies like PepsiCo (PEP) pay attention to what’s happening on TikTok, and often look for ways to get in on trends as a way to stay relevant to young consumers.\n\n“With the rise of the ‘dirty soda’ trend on TikTok and throughout the country, we thought Pilk and Cookies would be a great way to unapologetically celebrate the holidays,” said Kaplan.\n\nLindsay Lohan thinks you should try Pilk. Pepsi\n\nTo make the campaign even trendier, Pepsi tapped Lindsay Lohan, star of the Netflix (NFLX) Christmas movie “Falling for Christmas,” to promote the combination.\n\nPepsi is recommending a number of recipes to those who want to go beyond just Pepsi and milk, perhaps hoping to launch its own viral combination.\n\nA handful of those recipes include the Naughty & Ice, which is Pepsi with one cup of whole milk, one tablespoon of heavy cream and one tablespoon of vanilla cream, plus Pepsi; the Cherry on Top combines Pepsi Wild Cherry with half a cup of 2% milk, two tablespoons of heavy cream and two tablespoons of caramel creamer; and the Snow Fl(oat) is Pepsi Zero Sugar and half a cup of oat milk with four tablespoons of caramel creamer.\n\nTikTok trends\n\nThe soda cocktails are relatively new to TikTok — but they have been popular for years in Utah, which has a high concentration of Mormons, some of whom abstain from alcohol and hot beverages.\n\nTikTok discovered the drink after Gen-Z pop star Olivia Rodrigo posted a photo of herself holding a Swig cup in December last year, sending fans in search of answers about the Utah-based chain. Swig, which calls itself “home of the original dirty soda,” has been around since 2010 and serves a wide array of the carbonated mash-ups.\n\nThe trend quickly took off, Eater reported in April, saying “TikTok is now replete with more than 700,000 mentions of the #dirtysoda hashtag, most of which accompany videos of creators showing viewers how to make their own dirty sodas at home.”\n\nViral food sensations have inspired companies to capitalize on the trends, sometimes even creating new products based on what they see.\n\nIn September 2020, for example, Dunkin’ partnered with TikTok star Charli D’Amelio on a limited-time drink called The Charli — cold brew with whole milk and three pumps of caramel swirl — inspired by D’Amelio’s favorite order. On launch day, Dunkin’ hit a record for daily active app users. And last year, Starbucks experimented with selling the TikTok-popular Iced Matcha Latte with Chai on social platforms.\n\nKraft Heinz (KHC) this year launched Dip & Crunch, a burger dipping sauce packaged with “salty potato crunchers.” The idea is for people to dip a burger or sandwich into the sauce, then into the crunchers, and then take a bite — something that had apparently been trending on TikTok with some loving the trend and others questioning it.\n\n“For us to hear that debate online, then bring it to life, is an example of how we’re listening,” Sanjiv Gajiwala, then Kraft Heinz North America’s chief growth officer, told Fast Company in April. Now, you can find videos of TikTok influencers testing out the product in ads, and others reviewing it for their followers.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}]}

John Carney also has said the state Department of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families will collaborate with the city to coordinate services for at-risk families through the Child Development Community Policing program.\n\nThis program, which has been ongoing in the city since 2005, allows a police officer to request a state social worker to come to a scene to determine whether the child or family involved needs assistance from the state, according to release.\n\nRELATED: Wilmington mayor ups police patrols after recent shootings\n\nRELATED: Constant shootings in Wilmington ignite fear\n\nThese commitments come on the heels of Purzycki's announcement last week to increase foot patrols in the city, as well as increase efforts from the Safe Streets and DISRUPT units and other initiatives already ongoing in the city. The Safe Streets unit within the department focuses on the collaboration of Delaware Probation and Parole and city patrol officers to apprehend those violating probation or wanted by police.\n\nThe new plan appears to be an expansion of this program.\n\nMany of the efforts announced by Purzycki last week were not new to the department, but rather an increased focus on specific units already operating. Tuesday's announcement also brought with it reminders of past policies that didn't work in the long run, said former Wilmington police officer James Nolan, now a professor of sociology at West Virginia University.\n\nNolan did research for the city as a consultant under former Mayor Dennis P. Williams for a $35,000 fee, but many of his recommendations were never implemented, especially those that focused on community policing. Nolan believes that the success of policing must be based on the strength of neighborhoods and communities rather than the number of arrests.\n\nTuesday's announcement concerns him – hardball language and increased police officers focused on catching bad guys in tough neighborhoods do not foster relationships with residents.\n\n\"There's a lack of understanding as to what's really going on,\" Nolan said. \"There are plenty of opportunities to intervene, but (police are) not connected to anybody (before crimes occur). They can't get involved soon enough.\"\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matthew Meyer said the county stands \"side-by-side with the mayor and governor to address the criminal activity.\"\n\n“It is not acceptable if any community in our county is not safe,\" he said in a statement released by the city. \"We must all act to meet this threat to public safety. ... We will join forces with the neighborhoods of the city, not only to participate in this temporary policing operation, but also to increase community engagement in the long term.”\n\nThe problem, Nolan said, is that outside police agencies don't have the same investment in Wilmington as its city officers do, meaning that relationships that should be cultivated with key community members won't be during this influx of outside officers.\n\n\"Foot patrols from the county don't build relationships,\" he said. \"There's no thought being given to what really is the nature of the problem.\"\n\nPurzycki said he does intend to implement in the coming weeks and months recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued a report in November 2015 calling upon the city to focus efforts on city youth engaged in epidemic levels of gun violence.\n\nRELATED: 60-year-old man shot by Wilmington police identified\n\nRELATED: Wilmington police strategy chips away at crime\n\nCity Council President Hanifa Shabazz has said the Community Advisory Council will release its report with recommendations on how to implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's findings, calling on the city to adopt a new social service delivery system, as well as provide activities for youth, to help young people avoid criminal activity.\n\nThe CDC identified the lack of intervention among youth at pivotal moments in their lifetimes as a cause of the violence cycle.\n\n“We are all fed up with what a small number of people are doing to our city, and yet some residents are tired of being treated as though they are part of the problem instead of part of the solution,” Shabazz said. “We want everyone to have a chance to be part of the solution and stay clear of the increased police activity.”\n\nPurzycki stressed in his statement that \"even those who would rather not\" cooperate with investigations will be needed to curb Wilmington's spike in crime.\n\n\"This will not be a situation in which everyone is treated as a suspect,\" he said. \"We will respect the rights of law abiding citizens.

McBride, The News Journal\n\nWilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams was defeated in Tuesday's primary.\n\nMike Purzycki secured the Democratic nomination.\n\nMike Purzycki has unseated Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams, and more than likely will sit in that chair starting next year.\n\nAlong with handily defeating Williams, who had made Purzycki a target in the campaign’s final stages, the former Riverfront Development Corp. executive director bested six other Democrats Tuesday. Now only the general election and two candidates lacking high expectations for victory are left in his path.\n\nWilmington’s Democratic mayoral primary historically has served as the de facto election because of the city’s heavily Democratic voting advantage. With Williams out, Purzycki said he'll make himself part of the effort \"to save our city from where it was going.\"\n\nPurzycki captured 23.59 percent of the ballot, significantly less than a majority because of his large number of competitors. But it was enough to unseat Williams, who was expected throughout the race to rely most heavily on his longstanding constituent base in north Wilmington and the East Side, and to thwart the mayoral dreams of a diverse crowd of city leaders.\n\nAssuming he moves through the general election, Purzycki said one of his first moves as mayor will be prioritizing areas of the city to rehabilitate.\n\n“We want to identify the neighborhoods we want to start working on first, put together strategies that make our invested dollars give us the best return,” he said. “We have to rebuild our city.”\n\nPurzycki said he campaigned hard throughout the city but had strong support in the 8th City Council District.\n\n“I still have to introduce myself in many places so they start trusting not only my methods but my objectives and my heart,” he said. “That’s something that’s going to take time.”\n\nRochester, Bonini, Purzycki secure victories\n\nClear fundraising leaders emerge in primary races\n\nThe other Democrats in the race stuck it out from the day they announced until the last vote was cast, even when polls showed them far behind. There were very few examples throughout the campaign of infighting between them over policy points, except when it came to Williams, who was absent from most of the race’s political forums and who carried the advantages and challenges of an incumbent.\n\n“Mike is going to do a phenomenal job,” said Rob Buccini of the Buccini/Pollin Group.\n\nBuccini/Pollin has worked with Purzycki for many years on city development projects and expects their professional relationship to accelerate when Purzycki makes it to the mayor’s office.\n\nDelaware Center for Justice Advocacy Director Eugene Young earned the second most votes, collecting 21.78 percent of the vote Tuesday. Young ran an optimistic campaign in which he and supporters said they knocked on more than 50,000 doors.\n\nDespite being the only candidate in the race never to have served in an elected office, Young was able to generate enthusiasm from residents seeking change and even picked up the endorsement of The News Journal last week.\n\n\"I'm thankful for the opportunity to engage with so many people, share our ideas and hear their thoughts,\" he said.\n\nFormer City Councilman Kevin Kelley, making his second bid for the mayoral seat, was Wilmington’s third most popular choice, earning 20.29 percent of the vote. Williams received 13.97 percent; Council President Theo Gregory, 10.47 percent; former Councilman Norm Griffiths, 5.02 percent; Councilwoman Maria Cabrera, 3.11 percent; and state Sen. Bob Marshall, 1.77 percent.\n\n\"We got beat. Life goes on,\" Kelley said.\n\nCabrera said she felt good despite coming in second to last. She said she was willing to work with the new mayor.\n\n“I told Mike I would work with him and if I won that I would want him to work with me,” she said. “I feel that there’s opportunities for us to bring together a lot of our ideas and suggestions and still move Wilmington forward. This was never about Maria Cabrera. It was about my city and the people and doing what’s best for them.”\n\nMarshall said he will stand behind Purzycki and other Democrats running in November.\n\n“The voters decided that they wanted Mike,” he said. “So we all need to rally behind Mike and his administration and wish him well. And I’ll do alI that I can help to Mike and his team when we return to the Legislature in January.”\n\nNo Wilmington Republicans initially were on board for the race, but the party recently nominated businessman Robert Martin, who will appear on the general election ballot and who hopes to be the first Republican to hold the office since 1972.\n\nSteve Washington, an Independent, has been in the race longer, though he hasn’t seen much limelight. By virtue of his party, he will join Martin and Purzycki on the November general election ballot.\n\nBonini wins GOP governor primary\n\nHall-Long wins lieutenant governor primary\n\nPurzycki, a native of Newark, New Jersey, made Delaware his permanent home in 1968 after an injury sidelined him from pursuing a football career with the New York Giants.\n\nA graduate of Delaware Law School, Purzycki served as an attorney for the state Senate and practiced law for more than 10 years with a focus on real estate and commercial transactions.\n\nHis run for mayor was not his first run for office. In the 1980s, he served nine years on New Castle Council’s Finance Committee and drafted legislation for the state’s first ethics law.\n\nMuch of Purzycki’s campaign rested on his reputation of rebuilding the city’s waterfront as the head of the Riverfront Development Corp. In that role, he led the revitalization of the area where 1,400 people live and more than 7,000 work, according to his campaign staff.\n\nThough few can question the Riverfront's successes, it did become a talking point during some of the mayoral debates where Purzycki parried questions and accusations about gentrification by pointing to economic development as a tide that lifts all boats.\n\nPurzycki also recently led the Wilmington Hope Commission, which oversaw the creation of a transition program for formerly incarcerated men. He lives in the Highlands and is the father of two adult children and a 14-year-old.\n\nPaul Ford, a 70-year-old lifelong Wilmingtonian, said he’s seen many mayors – some good, some bad.\n\n“We’re about to see a real good one,” Ford said while dressed in a Purzycki campaign T-shirt at the celebration Tuesday night. “I just love the guy.”\n\nFord said he expects the improvements Purzycki led on the Riverfront to be replicated throughout the city if he’s elected mayor.\n\n“He is the only one who can walk into the mayor’s office on the first day and be effective,” Ford said. “He doesn’t need on-the-job training.”\n\nPurzycki actively courted Republicans during the race, aided by personal friend and former Republican Gov. Mike Castle. Williams tried to turn the issue against him, calling Purzycki “Mr. Republican” in one debate. In all, more than 1,200 Wilmingtonians switched their party affiliation from the GOP to the Democratic Party ahead of the primary.\n\n\"Everybody in the city has the right to be safe and have economic vitality,\" Purzycki said last month. \"There is nothing partisan about those issues.\"\n\nTuesday saw a flurry of activity on Wilmington streets with each of the candidates making their final bid to get voters to the polls.\n\nAt several polling locations, campaigners outnumbered voters, particularly at P.S. du Pont Middle School, where there was a line of bannered trucks, Mariah Carey music playing and a sea of supporters in campaign T-shirts.\n\n\"People are intimidated and overwhelmed. It's a nice case for absentee voting,\" said Valerie Trammel, a Cabrera supporter. \"Lots of votes come out of this location so people put a lot of energy here.\"\n\nVoters had to walk through a tunnel of supporters and candidates – including Williams, Griffiths and Cabrera – to get to the entrance.\n\nOne voter announced to the flier-wielding crowd that she'd already made up her mind: \"I know exactly what I'm doing!\"\n\nEven if they’d made up their minds by the time they cast their vote, having eight candidates to choose from and an election cycle which split its attention at least that many ways made the race frustrating and confusing for some.\n\n“I saw them at one dinner and they all said their lines, all talking, making a lot of promises, but then you never see them again. You only see them when they’re looking for votes,” said Peter Xarhoulakos, who said his choice, Gregory, bucked that trend.\n\nThough crowded mayoral fields in Wilmington aren’t exactly unusual – Williams was part of a five-way Democratic primary in 2012 – this season’s cast of eight was predicted to keep everything close.\n\nSTORY: In Wilmington mayor race, wide field obscures choices\n\nWhen The News Journal released a poll in July showing candidates such as Cabrera and Marshall were tracking support percentages in the single digits, many of them trashed the survey as insufficient to represent the realities of their campaigns.\n\n\"Because there were so many people in the race, some of the votes were taken from the candidates that actually had a chance to win,\" said Keith Dorman Jr., Kelley's campaign manager.\n\nAnd though Young took his defeat in stride, he could identify one of the key factors in his loss.\n\n\"If it were two of us or three of us, I think it could have been different. But I don’t think about that,\" Young said. \"These were the options, and we did the best we could with what was in front of us.\"\n\nWilliams predicted victory, and on Tuesday morning walked confidently through his city.\n\n“Some people have an opportunity tonight to sing, and seven people are going to cry,\" he said at Harlan Elementary School where he voted, presumably for himself. “Everybody's talking about what they're going to do that I've already done.”\n\nWilliams shied away from most of the race’s debates, claiming he’d be treated unfairly, that he had prior family engagements and the simple political calculus of letting his opponents beat each other up while he stood safely on the sidelines.\n\nBut he did attend a WDEL/WHYY debate in mid-August where he came out swinging, especially at Purzycki and Kelley, who his campaign had tried to link to Republicans in general and Donald Trump in particular. At the debate, Williams was combative, interruptive and insulting, and on Tuesday he showed his flamboyance again – approaching the polling place with his fist in the air.\n\n“He don't got a chance, baby,” Williams told a woman in a Griffiths T-shirt. Williams also told a Gregory supporter the council president could have the mayor’s office – in 2020.\n\nPurzycki didn't have to mention Williams by name in his post-election speech to make his point about the sitting mayor's behavior during the campaign.\n\n\"With one conspicuous exception I don't want to mention, our competitors in this race were such class acts,\" Purzycki said.\n\nThe loss shows Williams is not a supremely popular mayor.\n\nKevin Holt has lived in Wilmington all his life, and reducing crime was the issue he watched most closely during the election. He cast a vote for Gregory, whom he called a good person he’s known for many years. He didn’t go into detail on the reasons he didn’t vote for the current mayor.\n\n“There’s a bunch of them, but there are expletives in those reasons. I’ll hold that comment,” Holt said.\n\nBut his supporters turned out wearing T-shirts and waving signs – and they voted, too.\n\n\"Obviously, it's disappointing to someone like myself who is born and raised in Wilmington,\" said Williams supporter Pastor Derrick “D” Johnson, of Joshua Harvest Church in Wilmington. \"It's my home. However, the process has worked itself out. Still, you just are left with a question about the Republicans who agreed to switch their classifications in order to vote for Mr. Purzycki. That's the only aspect of it that's troubling because without those numbers, I believe it would've been a more fair playing field.”\n\nContact Christina Jedra at cjedra@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2837 or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.

Cries for justice go unanswered.\n\nThe constant crackle of gunfire makes longtime residents feel as if the city has abandoned them. Yet some teens act as if it can't touch them.\n\n\"There are only two roads that this (violence) leads to — death and prison,\" said the Rev. Donald Morton, a Wilmington pastor and executive director of the Complexities of Color Coalition, a grassroots effort to address racial oppression. \"And both of those roads, the young people are not afraid of. It just doesn't matter to them anymore.\"\n\nAbout 41,000 of Wilmington's nearly 72,000 residents are African-American, as are most suspects and victims of gun violence. At the end of August, 43 of the last 50 homicide victims in the city were black.\n\nMorton and others said political, religious and law enforcement leaders must own the ongoing bloodbath — and plot a course to correct it.\n\n\"The failure is ours,\" added Morton, pastor of the Tabernacle Full Gospel Baptist Church, \"on individuals that have let this go too long hoping this would self-correct.”\n\nIn 2013, Wilmington City Councilwoman Hanifa Shabazz asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study gun violence as a public health epidemic – a new undertaking for the agency, which normally uses its investigative teams to determine whether environmental factors are causing health issues such as cancer clusters.\n\nThe CDC provided Wilmington with a one-of-a-kind prescription to quell the shootings in its 2015 report, noting that Delaware's largest city experienced \"epidemic levels of urban gun violence.\"\n\nBut no local or state dollars have been allocated to implement the key component of the CDC roadmap: Use data such as truancy records, emergency room visits and domestic abuse allegations to identify at-risk children, and intervene in their lives early — while in elementary and middle school — when the information signals a potentially life-alerting alarm.\n\nInteractive Map:Explore Wilmington shootings\n\nThe CDC also said Delaware must provide these children with life-skills programs and relationships to serve as a foundation for their future. Mentorships and smart programming could help more children turn their lives around, stay out of prison and survive, the agency said.\n\nNo money was allocated by former Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams or former Gov. Jack Markell. And newly elected leaders Mayor Mike Purzycki and Gov. John Carney have yet to put any money behind the CDC's data-focused road map.\n\nIn interviews with The News Journal, Carney acknowledged that the data plan was a state responsibility, but said he would not allocate more state dollars for the city until he was assured all expenditures were being used wisely.\n\nDr. Kara Odom Walker, secretary of the state Department of Health and Social Services, estimated that the CDC plan would cost about $1 million to $2 million annually, but offered no real timeline on how soon it could be put into practice.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilmington witnessed 140 people shot by the end of August — an average of four per week in what may be a record year for bloodshed. In 2013, the year Shabazz was moved to request CDC help, shootings peaked at 154 for the whole year — the city's standing record.\n\n“The CDC gave us a preventative intervention,” said Rita Landgraf, former secretary of the state Department of Health and Social Services who is still working on the CDC plan. “If we were going to remain true to that model, then we would have to be able to look at this data … (and) reach those children identified by the data.”\n\nIn 2016, the Markell administration named 25 community members and local leaders to a CDC Community Advisory Council tasked with developing a plan for implementing the CDC's recommendation. The council, led by Shabazz, now president of Wilmington City Council, spent almost a year compiling its own 51-page \"Call to Action\" report focused on its own recommendations for services to reduce youth violence.\n\nThe Delaware report agreed that the city should gather data on at-risk children, but it didn't say where it would find the money, people or software to make it happen.\n\nThere's also a legal hurdle to clear: To build the kind of profile the CDC recommended, government agencies and private aid organizations would need to combine a wealth of information. That requires a workaround of federal and state privacy laws, officials said.\n\n“We couldn’t get around the first hurdle,” said Henry Smith, co-chair of the CDC Community Advisory Council created to implement the plan. Delaware lawyers are working to resolve the legal issues, he said.\n\nYet data aggregation is not as difficult as Delaware is making it, said CDC researcher Steven Sumner.\n\nLast year, he mapped the lives of 421 Wilmington residents arrested for gun crimes between 2009 and 2014, using the same data the state is having trouble obtaining and sharing. He released his findings to demonstrate that identifying at-risk youth is doable using the CDC’s method.\n\nWilmington also contacted Allegheny County, Pennsylvania — an area encompassing Pittsburgh and some of its suburbs — to see how another metropolitan area overcame the obstacles. While the purpose of Allegheny's data warehouse is different — to help social workers see the complete picture of the families they serve — the bedrock hardware would be similar.\n\nIt cost Allegheny County $2.5 million to create a data warehouse in 1999 and another $1.8 million a year to pay staff and maintain the strategy. The price tag could be far less for Wilmington, which has only 5 percent of the population Allegheny serves.\n\n“They (Delaware) can buy the technology and analytics,” said Erin Dalton, a deputy director for the Allegheny office of data analysis, research and evaluation. \"They can’t buy the political will.”\n\nThis year, the CDC advisory council focused on strengthening existing programs targeting city youth, and on new training for community center staff to recognize trauma.\n\n“This is not going to be done overnight,” Shabazz said. “I think our progress is tremendous.”\n\nThe advisory council has been meeting regularly since the spring to identify which youth programs are effective and where they can share resources between government and nonprofit agencies, she said.\n\n\"You've never seen such a collaboration to address one issue, ever,\" Shabazz said.\n\nStill, the violence — largely perpetrated by teen gangs — pushed Delaware's largest city to the most dangerous place in America for kids ages 12 to 17, according to an analysis of Gun Violence Archive per capita data by The News Journal, USA TODAY and the Associated Press.\n\nToday, the situation for teens in Wilmington is actually worse than when the CDC was called.\n\nThe last juvenile to lose her life was 16-year-old Tynesia Cephas, gunned down while trying to break up a fight on Wilmington's East Side. Her boyfriend and his family watched as she took her last breath on a row home floor after being shot on Kirkwood Street.\n\n“It’s like death don’t have an age right now, and bullets damn don’t have a name,” said Tyzell Cephas, the girl's 23-year-old brother.\n\nOn the same day Cephas died, Delaware State Police Cpl. Stephen Ballard was killed in a Wawa parking lot in the unincorporated community of Bear. The state immediately rallied behind law enforcement and was transfixed on the search for Ballard's killer, who barricaded himself inside his family's Middletown home with scores of police officers outside.\n\nThe siege ended 21 hours later when 26-year-old Burgon Sealy Jr. was shot dead after an armored tank began disassembling his family's home.\n\nWeeks later, Ballard's wife, Louise, told those gathered at a CDC Community Advisory Council meeting that her husband would want his death to spur change — not just for his family, but for those suffering from violence statewide.\n\n“My daughter and I are going to be OK, but this community is struggling,” she said at the gathering in Wilmington. \"I have the entire state at my fingertips right now. I’ll hold them (accountable) to put the money where their mouth is and cause action. … That’s what my husband would want.”\n\nCephas’ death drew much less attention. Her killer has not been found, even though the shooter fired among a large crowd.\n\nFor many, the killing made April 26 just another day on the city’s streets.\n\nPurzycki and other local leaders stopped by the service at Ezion Fair Baptist Church where Cephas was laid to rest in a gold-trimmed white casket weeks after her death. Trophies marking her achievements for baseball and the Juneteenth Pageant glimmered next to her coffin, adorned with red and white flowers.\n\n“The mayor shook hands, said, ‘I’m sorry for your loss,’” recalled Cephas' brother, Tyzell. “And that’s nice, but I wanna know what paperwork y’all getting ready to file to get this thing rolling … to make sure this never happens again.”\n\nBeing raised in a neighborhood racked with poverty, where shootings and drug dealing are an everyday occurrence, and where liquor stores vastly outnumber grocery stores, puts a child at an obvious disadvantage, the CDC said in its report on Wilmington.\n\nEach time a child visits a community center, attends school or gets a summer job, his or her chances at a more stable, successful life improves, according to the CDC.\n\nConversely, each run-in with the law, each act of violence witnessed, makes it more difficult to reach the child before he becomes a victim of, or engages in, crime that forever alters his future, said the CDC, which has examined only Wilmington's gun violence epidemic among America's cities.\n\nWere the CDC plan implemented, each negative life event would be assigned a score. And if a child's score reached a tipping point, an intervention could be made when the state is called to a child’s home to investigate a report of abuse, when a teenager is arrested, when a student confides in his teacher about a sibling being shot, or when a parent files for unemployment benefits.\n\nIt begins with reaching Wilmington teens like a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old, who agreed to speak to The News Journal on the condition that they not be identified — because speaking about the streets, even for those outside of the gang life, could get one killed.\n\nIf the CDC plan was in place, these young men may have racked up a high number of points purely because of the ZIP code in which they lived and their life experiences.\n\nThe 19-year-old recalls living in Philadelphia’s public housing as a child, while his mother worked two jobs and went to school. His grandmother, who was supposed to be watching him and his siblings, was too strung out on drugs to care for the children, he said.\n\n“I was 9 years old, walking outside to figure out how to get money to feed me, my little brother, and my baby sister,” he said, tears rolling down his cheeks.\n\nA few years later, his mother moved the family to Wilmington to get away from violence and poverty. But life here was no different. In Wilmington, the teen said, he was beaten up his first week of sixth grade.\n\nHe was on his way to the cafeteria when a group of classmates punched him repeatedly over a rumor swirling about a girl. He said he sat alone in the lunch room, afraid to tell teachers what had happened.\n\nIt was a middle school lesson in the city's no-snitch code — and a reminder that “keeping your head up” to look tough is important in dangerous situations.\n\nThe experience made the teen angry – angry enough to join a group of kids he felt could ensure he'd never be beaten up again. His new friendships frightened his mom, who worried the relationships would endanger her other children.\n\nThe boy's mother ultimately kicked the teen out of the house. With no place to go, he said he began sleeping in a park. Without a cellphone, it took him weeks to learn his best friend had been caught carrying a gun and was sent to prison.\n\nThat ended the 19-year-old's dream of walking through high school graduation with his friend. But he did walk across the stage alone, and today he has a diploma and a part-time job.\n\nAnother 17-year-old Wilmington boy who hopes to be the first person in his family to graduate high school also wanted to walk at graduation with his best friend — but his friend was killed by gun violence. And months later, his brother was gunned down on Wilmington’s streets.\n\nHe had a searing urge for revenge.\n\n“It makes you want to go out and do something reckless,\" he said. \"But I got a mom here. I got people I’ve got to take care of. It hurts every day, looking at them and knowing my brother is never coming home.”\n\nHad the CDC plan been in place, a caseworker would have intervened in the 19-year-old's life when he got kicked out of his house or beaten up at school. The 17-year-old could have gotten therapy after losing his friend and his brother.\n\nBoth boys are determined to get out of Wilmington. Otherwise, they fear they will be pulled into a way of life they want to avoid.\n\n“I'm not about to sit here and be another statistic,” the 19-year-old said.\n\nAdded the 17-year-old: “It’s not as easy as everybody thinks it is.”\n\nWith no government funding in sight for intervention suggested by the CDC, Shabazz’s strategy is to “re-appropriate dollars” from treatment programs to jump-start the roadmap suggested by the federal agency.\n\nShe believes shifting existing dollars toward younger children who have yet to be exposed to trauma would be more successful than trying to change the lives of adults who've already established long criminal histories. But she wouldn’t specify which treatment programs would be cut.\n\nThe CDC advisory council earlier this year discussed launching a \"Summer for Success Campaign,\" which council members said would include rallies to kick off programs and free bus passes for youth to get to recreation centers. Those ideas did not come to fruition.\n\nInstead, the advisory council backed already-existing community centers — dubbed \"Safe Havens\" for the program — and their extended summer hours. The group also endorsed summer learning programs for low-income kids, and trained community center staff in early June on recognizing the signs of children experiencing trauma.\n\nThe city renewed its annual program to hire 450 youth for summer jobs at day camps, landscaping businesses and office buildings. Shabazz believed these efforts would help curb teen violence in the city while kids are out of school. Still, five kids under the age of 18 were shot from June through August.\n\nOthers on the CDC council have created a plan to link four city schools with community health and social services in New Castle County. The pilot program, modeled after Boston-based City Connects, uses software to create a profile for each student so that the child can continue to receive services even if they transfer between schools and districts.\n\nIt could have begun this fall, but it received no state funding.\n\nTraining coordinators at each school would cost an estimated $100,000 for the first year, said Matt Swanson, executive chairman of Innovative Schools, an organization that supports new efforts in educating Delaware children. After two years of training staff, it would require just $3,000 to sustain, he said.\n\n\"You can really lose a kid when a family gets displaced in the middle of a school year,\" Swanson said. \"Services that they may have found, they may lose when they transfer schools.\"\n\nOther projects that have been discussed include a youth wellness center modeled after a city re-entry program, and an alternative school suspension program. Many of these efforts require funding, which has yet to be secured.\n\n“We’re still throwing stuff against the wall, and seeing what sticks,” said Parks and Recreation Director Kevin F. Kelley Sr.\n\nOn top of looking at programs for youth, Purzycki announced in May a “neighborhood stabilization program” he hopes will turn around the city’s roughest neighborhoods with greater police presence, increased trash pickup, and a crackdown on liquor stores and nuisance properties.\n\nThe first neighborhood focus is West Center City, the historic zone from Adams to Tatnall streets, and Fourth to 10th streets.\n\nFew places need help more. Not only is West Center City one of the most violent areas, more than 1 in 10 properties are registered as vacant, and property owners owe the city $1.8 million in unpaid taxes.\n\nRevitalizing the area could have an impact because it is adjacent to the city’s downtown business district and sits against I-95. But similar West Center City efforts dating back to the 1960s have failed to create sustainable change.\n\nMeanwhile, Delaware Attorney Matt Denn pledged $900,000 through the Neighborhood Building Blocks Fund to after-school and summer programs targeting Delaware youth. These efforts include a soccer league for teens in Wilmington's Hilltop neighborhood and a stipend for teens who pick up trash and paint positive messages on boards covering windows of abandoned buildings in West Center City.\n\nAnd Carney re-established the Family Services Cabinet Council to break down silos that can separate state programs, such as job training, early childhood education, substance abuse treatment and affordable housing.\n\nYet many caution that while these types of revitalization efforts sound good, agency collaborations and youth programs are useless if the city and state aren’t capable of identifying which children and homes need services the most.\n\n“I’m worried about the kids that aren’t coming [to community centers],” said Paul Calistro, the director of the West End Neighborhood House, a nonprofit in Wilmington’s Little Italy neighborhood. “I’m worried about the corner kids.”\n\nMost kids in the city rarely see run-ins with police as positive, said newly appointed Wilmington police Chief Robert Tracy. He hopes to change that by bringing to Wilmington the Group Violence Intervention strategy used in cities like Chicago and New York.\n\nIn reality, only about one-half of 1 percent of Wilmington's population is responsible for the city's gun violence, said David Kennedy, a criminologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. Instead of characterizing these impoverished neighborhoods as violent places dominated by bad people, police need to recognize that many good people live in these communities, said Kennedy, who is helping Tracy implement a new policing strategy.\n\n\"What we should recognize about the rest of them is they were born into communities that have historically been treated in ways that have done them incredible damage,\" Kennedy said.\n\nIn Chicago, Tracy used “gang call-ins” to bring together troublemakers and let them hear directly from the people they were hurting: business leaders unable to make money, family members mourning the loss of loved ones and hardworking citizens just trying to scratch out a living.\n\nThese meetings served as opportunities for police and social workers to connect with the people that needed them most, Tracy said. If a man said he couldn’t get a job because he didn’t have job training, services were made available. When a woman said she lacked a photo ID, social workers jumped in to fix the problem.\n\nAnd if the people ignored these opportunities and continued to commit crimes, police pursued arrests. It could be effective in tamping down Wilmington's gang war, the chief said.\n\n\"What we want you to do is stay away from the violence, put the guns down, share the message with the people you're with,” Tracy said, “because if the person that commits the crime is someone who is connected to you in some way ... (and) associated with a gang, you're all now responsible.\"\n\nState prosecutors use a similar approach to hold gang members accountable for the crimes of associates. They used Delaware's gang participation statute in last year’s broad indictment against 29 members of the Only My Brothers gang.\n\nIt's an effective tool to get gang members off the streets, said members of the Violent Criminal Enterprises Unit, created by the Attorney General’s Office in August.\n\n\"That is the most bang for your buck,\" said Deputy Attorney General Joseph Grubb. \"That is the way to make the streets the most safe, from a prosecutorial angle.\"\n\nThe city does not have a gang unit, however. And Wilmington police Master Sgt. William Schmid wonders if it would benefit from one.\n\n\"It's like addiction,\" said Schmid, who has spent years attending trainings on gang activity. \"Until we all acknowledge it and say the four-letter word, gang, it's not going to get better. So let's just accept it and figure out a way to address it.\"\n\nMany of the city's teens have lost connection with African-American churches that long served as the foundation for Wilmington communities, the Rev. Morton said.\n\nThe disconnect has left them without a sense of culture, heritage and values, said Morton, who recalled the programs that fostered his growth as a young man in Wilmington. Until church services and programs become \"sexy enough\" to get youth through the doors, Morton said the community should not be surprised by the violent ways city youth choose to express themselves.\n\n“Half the time, these kids’ first time in a church is at a funeral,” said Tynesia Cephas’ cousin, Laqueen McDuffie.\n\nAt Cephas' funeral, the Rev. Lester Justice urged children to speak out against violence in Wilmington’s streets.\n\n\"When we hear about things that are about to occur, we have to come together and say, 'We're not about that life,'\" Justice said. \"Whether it's at school, at home, in the neighborhood, in the community, we have to say, 'I have a foundation. I want to do better than this.'\"\n\nTeens need guidance to overcome constant exposure to violence, poverty and oppression that began when their ancestors were slaves, Morton said.\n\n\"Anytime someone continues to experience (violence) and nobody's treating it, in the way for almost 400 years we've not been treating it, we're going to continue getting what we're getting,\" Morton said. \"Even the people pulling the trigger are pulling the trigger because of trauma.\"\n\nTracy, state Attorney General Denn and others know that reaching children at the youngest age possible is key to ensuring they never pick up a gun — or end up a victim themselves.\n\n“There’s no age where it’s too young to be thinking about this stuff,” Denn said.\n\nTracy plans to start calling local schools each morning like he did in Chicago to share information on students whose families may have been impacted by gun violence the night before. Doing so in Delaware is harder due to the fragmented school system, he said, but Tracy hopes to overcome that hurdle.\n\nIf nothing is done, community leaders and parents fear teenagers who have already had run-ins with the criminal justice system will constitute another lost generation of young black men.\n\nJahlil Lewis, the 17-year-old who pleaded guilty as part of the Only My Brothers case, was sentenced to two years in prison and is expected to return home before he turns 18.\n\nHis mother, Latisha Jackson, and other parents banded together after their sons were indicted to create a support group called Save Our Sons, and 302 Mothers and Fathers In Action. The parents worry their children will have limited opportunities due to felony gun charges and the no-contact orders put in place to keep them from associating with their childhood friends-turned-accused gang members.\n\nStatistically, the odds are stacked against Jahlil and his friends – because of their age and their criminal records.\n\nA Wilmington teen on community probation is 13 times more likely to be arrested for firearm-related violence than the average child, according to CDC research.\n\nIn a sentencing request this summer for Nakeem Bailey, state prosecutors asked for four years behind bars followed by probation for the 16-year-old’s guilty plea. Already, state prosecutor Mark Denney said in a letter to the judge, six of Bailey’s co-defendants were released from prison — and had again committed more crimes.\n\nBailey also was “among the more brazen OMB members in his display of handguns through photographs and videos,” Denney wrote. These photos depicted Bailey posing with his handgun and pointing it at the camera. Text messages submitted to the judge also show Bailey asking for a $200 handgun with specific requests for the barrel size and magazine capacity.\n\nIn late June, Naseem Parks — who pleaded guilty earlier this year to gang participation and gun possession — was charged again with gang participation and rioting after beating up a known member of the rival Shoot to Kill gang in prison. His additional charges, if found guilty, will tack years onto his sentence.\n\nBut others, like Jahlil, have plans for their futures.\n\nHe told his mom from inside prison that he wants to get his GED, move into his own apartment, work two jobs and buy a car, Latisha Jackson recalled. All of those things would keep him away from the street lifestyle that landed him behind bars.\n\n“One mistake is not his life,” Jackson said. “A lot of (teens) are dying, and I want my kids to live.”\n\nThis yearlong investigative project sought to unravel the driving force behind Wilmington's teen violence, an ongoing plague in the city considered most dangerous for children in all of America. Journalists spent more than a year interviewing both the teens affected by the violence and those charged with committing these crimes, state prosecutors, police officers, community members and family members. Reporters attended funerals of children lost to the violence, community meetings and rallies condemning the gunfire, and court hearings of teens and young adults charged with gun violence. Journalists also pored over thousands of pages of court documents, data requests and social media posts to re-create a full account of what prompted a teenage gang war to break out in Delaware's largest city. This three-day series is the result of those efforts.\n\nBrittany Horn is an investigative reporter at The News Journal who has chronicled Wilmington's gun violence and Delaware's struggle with the heroin and opioid epidemic.\n\nEsteban Parra is the solutions and breaking news reporter at The News Journal, where he has worked for more than 20 years covering business, courts, police and Wilmington.\n\nChristina Jedra is Wilmington’s watchdog reporter and focuses on holding elected officials accountable and helping city residents understand how their government works.\n\nJessica Reyes was the courts and justice reporter at The News Journal, where she documented the state's debate about the death penalty and equal access to justice.\n\nPhotos and video used in this series were taken by staff photographers Jennifer Corbett, Suchat Pederson, Daniel Sato, William Bretzger, Damian Giletto and Kyle Grantham.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/02/wilmington-home-affordable-housing-federal-money-habitat-for-humanity/7460778001/", "title": "New Wilmington homes look to curb Delaware's affordable housing ...", "text": "The red brick rowhomes along Bennett Street on Wilmington's East Side stand regally, recently poured concrete steps leading to brightly colored doors.\n\nResidents here have placed flower pots and other greenery next to their stoops, and Ring doorbell cameras hang beside black mailboxes drilled into the new brick.\n\nAcross the street, five new homes built with the same materials are nearing completion, though the wood beams that make up front porches have yet to be painted.

The space and neighboring lots will be used to build six new homes in a neighborhood that struggles with vacancy and violence.\n\n\"The land bank is focused on getting vacant properties back into use,\" said Christian Willauer, executive director of the nonprofit land bank. \"This project is an example of the role the land bank can play in working with organizations developing affordable housing.\"\n\nWithout a land bank, Willauer said prospective buyers of abandoned homes would have to buy it at sheriff sale at the cost of the property's accrued debt, including back taxes and water bills. That means a house's price tag could be much more than the property is actually worth, she said, which makes selling it almost impossible.\n\n\"If a vacant and abandoned property like this one owes $40,000, it will remain vacant for the rest of our lifetimes,\" Willauer said.\n\nUnder the land bank model, when the city is unable to sell a property at sheriff sale, the property is transferred to the land bank and the city forgives the property's debt, Willauer said.\n\n\"What that does is allows the land bank to sell that property at whatever price is going to get it back into use,\" she said. \"The new owner can feel confident that they're starting off with a clean slate. That's really important for promoting investment in our city.\"\n\nBesides affordable housing, Willauer said possible developments could be a neighbor acquiring a vacant lot for $100 to expand their yard, a group buying or leasing land for a community garden or private developers creating new structures.\n\nRELATED: Wilmington council president hires Rep. Bolden as receptionist\n\nHalf of the land bank's 92 properties, which were transferred from the city in October, are scattered single-family residential properties, Willauer said, and will appeal mostly to potential homeowners. The other half are vacant lots.\n\nThe land bank can set criteria regarding who buys from their inventory, she said. Priority will be given to buyers who have the vision, commitment and finances to fix a property up.\n\nThat's important to residents like 41-year-old Nicole Bowe, who said it's not helpful to a community when affordable housing projects are sold to nonprofits.\n\n\"I hope it's all old people moving in on the block,\" she said.\n\nThe Rev. Pastor Sandra Ben, who operates Praying Ground Church on 22nd Street, said the new construction is \"a start.\"\n\n\"I think it makes the new neighbors that come in have hope, that it's OK to be here,\" she said.\n\nBy facilitating new uses for abandoned properties, giving opportunities to homebuyers and spurring jobs for local construction workers, the land bank is a key to \"how to turn our city around,\" said City Council President Hanifa Shabazz\n\n\"We are going to make sure that everyone is able to feel the benefits of the work of the land bank,\" she said.\n\nWithout redevelopment, blighted homes \"put a damper\" on new homeowners coming into the neighborhood, said Kevin Smith, the chief executive officer for Habitat for Humanity.\n\nThe land bank helps \"move projects forward faster, more efficiently, so that we all can win,\" Smith said.\n\nIn the past, when nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity wanted to raze and rebuild a property, they had to cover the acquisition and demolition costs, said Kevin Smith, the chief executive officer for Habitat.\n\nOn East 22nd Street, the land bank covered those costs.\n\n\"Today is the beginning of a new way of doing business in the city of Wilmington for the nonprofit developers, and we also hope the for-profit developers,\" he said.\n\nThe land bank was assisted by a $1 million grant from the Wilmington-based Barclaycard and a $1.5 million contribution from the city in 2016. Wilmington City Council approved the formation of the land bank in November 2015.\n\n\"We believe in the mayor's mission of trying to improve and strengthen our neighborhoods, and it's not through gentrification,\" said Jocelyn Stewart, senior director of community investment for Barclaycard US.\n\nThe land bank's opening project comes as the mayor attempts to rewrite the housing code to make it easier for the city to acquire vacant and neglected homes that would become part of the land bank's inventory.\n\nA reform measure proposed in October would convert housing enforcement from a criminal to a civil matter. Unpaid housing code violations, from broken windows to crumbling foundational walls, would become liens on a property and could eventually proceed to sheriff sale, according to the legislation.\n\nRELATED: Wilmington mayor's anti-blight effort hits roadblock\n\nCity residents and council members have expressed concerns that low-income homeowners could have their property taken if they are unable to make repairs. The mayor has insisted that is not his intention to target occupied homes and is working to revise the legislation to reflect that.\n\nThe mayor had hoped to have the legislation passed by now so it could be implemented this spring, but his office has not offered an updated timeline since it was delayed by the council in December.\n\nOn Monday, Purzycki said the land bank is an example of effective collaboration.\n\n\"The city is only going to change when all of our partners get their oars in the water together and pull and row as hard as they can,\" he said. \"And that’s what we’re doing.\"\n\nContact Christina Jedra at (302) 324-2837, cjedra@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ChristinaJedra.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2017/12/18/without-grant-plans-more-ncco-foot-patrols-canceled/926159001/", "title": "Without grant, plans for more NCCo foot patrols canceled", "text": "New Castle County Police will not expand its foot patrol program as its colonel had hoped because the county decided the costs associated with hiring new officers is too high.\n\nIn July, the department applied for a federal COPS grant that would have offered nearly $2 million for new officers.\n\nThat grant money was going to be used to hire 15 new officers so Col. Vaughn Bond could place additional senior officers on foot patrols, part of his strategy announced earlier in the year to reinvigorate community-oriented policing.\n\nNow he can't.\n\nThere are two patrols in the county walking the streets along the Del. 9 corridor and in Edgemoor as part of Bond's plan. But he wanted more.\n\nThe federal grant required matching funds that would have cost the county $1.4million over its three-year life, according to New Castle County Chief Administrative Officer Kathy Jennings. Once the grant expired, they'd have to keep the elevated number of officers.\n\n\"That ends up being exponentially more expensive at a time when we're operating in a structural deficit,\" Jennings said. \"We can't fund something we can't afford to pay for over the long term.\"\n\nThe county did announce Wednesday it has accepted a no-strings attached $118,628 grant from the University of Baltimore to hire a coordinator for its Hero Help Program, which offers treatment as an alternative for lesser criminal drug charges.\n\nThe 1-year grant will pay the salary for a coordinator, as well as for some of the department's overdose-reversing drugs and program marketing, according to spokeswoman Master Cpl. Heather Carter. The coordinator will be a police department employee.\n\nWithdrawing from the COPS grant won't preclude the county from taking it next year, or hiring officers with other funds in the future, Jennings said.\n\nThe decision has not been popular.\n\nThe New Castle County Council Public Safety Committee on Dec. 13 took up the issue of police hiring. None of its members spoke in defense of the budget-based decision to turn down the grant.\n\nCouncil members are angry County Executive Matt Meyer made the grant decision, as they see it, alone. Backing out for the first time in years, they said, unnecessarily left money on the table.\n\n\"This was a grave error in judgment,\" Councilman Jea Street told Jennings and the committee.\n\nDelaware Fraternal Order of Police President Fred Calhoun, himself a New Castle County Police officer, believes costs are a poor argument for missing an opportunity to have more officers.\n\n\"I am disappointed that they are not taking this grant. It's a sad day when a person puts the projected or presumed or perceived budgetary issues in place of the welfare and safety of the community and the officers,\" Calhoun said. \"I'm just not sure I buy that as an excuse.\"\n\nThe rank-and-file officers aren't happy either, according to Michael Zielinski, president of FOP Lodge 5.\n\n\"They feel the department was on a very good path of progressing forward, and they feel like we're taking a step backward now,\" Zielinski said. \"This was an opportunity for some type of relief.\"\n\nMORE: New Castle County puts more officers on foot patrols\n\nSince the early 1990s, Community Oriented Policing Services grants have given local police forces almost $15 billion.\n\nThe concept of community policing is simple: the better residents know their local officers, the more willingly they would be to cooperate and the less tension there will be with police.\n\n\"It's really important in 2017 that police officers get out of their cars,\" County Executive Matt Meyer said in July. \"There's a whole lot of data that shows if you put uniformed officers on the street outside their cars doing old fashioned-style policing, it actually prevents crime.\"\n\nDuring Wilmington's mayoral race, when more than a half-dozen candidates were making their pitches to save the city from its violent crime problem, getting officers to leave their cars and walk beats was a constant refrain.\n\nAnd that's happening now under new city Police Chief Robert Tracy, though he's told residents to give his department time to adjust to a new strategy and warned that results won't be instantly obvious.\n\n\"We in policing have done a very bad job of gaining trust in some communities,\" Tracy told the Wilmington Police Athletic League in July. \"It starts with these community meetings, transparency, having a dialogue, being respectful. Respect in the community is going to come back.\"\n\nWilmington rejected a similar COPS grant this year for reasons of cost. Mayor Mike Purzycki and Tracy agreed the city is staffed with sufficient officers.\n\nMORE:Purzycki rejects $1.8M grant for 15 police officers\n\nBond is of a similar mind as Tracy when it comes to community policing, and increasing foot patrols was to be one of his key initiatives.\n\n\"I take my direction from the men, the women, the residents of New Castle County,\" Bond said in July, around the time the department applied for the grant. \"When you're going to community meetings and listening to what they want, they're asking for this.\"\n\nMORE:Girls from Edgemoor Gardens get princess treatment at police ball\n\nCounty residents still will get community policing, Bond said. He pointed to summertime events like play zones set up for kids and the Police and Princess Ball in October, which Bond said put officers in a position to better know who they serve and vice versa.\n\n\"We're not going to stop. We're still going to keep moving forward with the mission of providing quality community policing,\" Bond said. \"Simply because we had to withdraw from this particular grant at this particular time doesn't mean the wheels of the bus stop moving.\"\n\nMORE:Signs of hope for community policing in Wilmington: Editorial\n\nThose programs have their value, Calhoun said, but when mentioned alongside foot patrols in a conversation on community policing they're little more than \"smoke and mirrors.\"\n\n\"The kids that are going to those balls, going to those events, they're not the ones causing you problems,\" Calhoun said. \"That type of community policing is not helping you determine what individuals are causing the crime out on the streets.\"\n\nThe New Castle department has 15 community engagement specialists; four assigned to two-man foot patrols.\n\nIt has an authorized strength of 400 officers, up from 385 prior to accepting a 2015 COPS grant. There are 393 officers on the current roster including the current academy class.\n\nThere are 22 cadets in academy now, and at the public safety committee meeting, Bond said they represented most of the qualified candidates from about 1,500 applications.\n\nBond said the average rate of officers leaving the force over the past few years has been about 22 per year.\n\nNext year, more than 60 officers will be eligible for retirement, Bond said. The process of getting a new officer – from placing an advertisement to pinning on a badge – usually takes about a year and a half.\n\nStreet grilled Bond and Jennings over these numbers at the committee meeting. His argument was attrition will more than make up for the addition of 15 officers partly funded with grants.\n\n\"To your knowledge, has there been a time we have received a grant with comparable requirements where we didn't find it sustainable after a three-year period?\" Street asked Bond.\n\n\"Not to my knowledge, no,\" Bond replied.\n\nFifteen officers were hired through the 2015 COPS grant. It cost the county $1.4 in matching funds over three years, and they're required to continue paying their salaries after the federal money stops in 2018. Jennings said that will add another $1.8million to the budget.\n\nJennings pointed to an 8 percent decrease in reported county crime this year as proof community policing efforts have been successful. She stressed that future grants may be acceptable to the county administration when the budget can bear the cost.\n\n\"You look at where we are right now with the New Castle County Police, and ingrained in their DNA is community policing. They do an outstanding job of it,\" Jennings said.\n\nIncreases in violent crime, especially in Wilmington, and the heroin epidemic are driving up calls for service for New Castle County Paramedics, which Jennings said have not added staff and had to cut $1 million from their budget this year.\n\n\"You have a paramedic service that is very stressed,\" Jennings said. \"We really need to make sure we're fiscally responsible and that we take into account saving lives and public safety.\"\n\nCalhoun said the decision is on the shoulders of the county executive, not the police colonel.\n\n\"Any time you turn down money, it's a bad idea,\" Calhoun said. \"It's the aspect of not hiring through attrition, placing the burden of finances on your employees as opposed to raising taxes or really sitting back and looking at what your costs are, figuring out a clean way without affecting your police.\"\n\nZielinski doesn't believe the department can accomplish its goals without more officers. He believes crime is down because the department built specialized units, sometimes with federal funds, focused specifically on proactive policing.\n\n\"You can't just walk into a community and be able to fix and repair all those problems in a couple of days,\" Zielinski said. \"You can't take resources away from the patrol division, who are responsible for responding to in-progress complaints that are reactive-driven 911 responses, and create other specialized units to combat high-crime or problem areas.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at aduvernay@delawareonline.com or (302) 319-1855 or @duvINdelaware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/24/keep-up-latest-businesses-coming-and-going-delaware/9779461002/", "title": "Keep up with the latest on businesses coming and going in Delaware", "text": "We've all driven past a construction site and wondered what it will become.\n\nWe hope that this collection of our development coverage will produce answers to some of those questions.\n\nThe stories listed below detail the explosion of warehouse space in Delaware, the ceaseless debates between preservation and growth unfolding across the state and some of the most anticipated stores and businesses coming soon.\n\nConsider bookmarking this page as the list will be updated throughout the summer.

We just want normality.\"\n\nCreating that sense of normalcy was precisely the goal for Marva Hammond and her 80-year-old father, Charlie Falletta when they established the building in Wilmington’s Southbridge neighborhood in April 2023. They understood that providing affordable apartments alone wasn’t enough – removing everyday barriers was essential for seniors transitioning from homelessness.\n\nThe 26-unit building, specifically designed for older homeless individuals with a focus on veterans, includes features to address some of the key factors that contribute to homelessness.\n\nNine units opened in the first phase in summer 2023, housing several tenants from the Hope Center, including three veterans. Thirteen additional units were completed in August, and three more veterans have since moved in, with more expected by Thanksgiving.\n\nMarva Hammond and her family's focus on homeless veterans stems from a deep appreciation for the sacrifices made by members of the armed services. Hammond is struck by the lack of attention given to the significant challenges faced by veterans returning to civilian life with unresolved mental health issues and barriers to housing.\n\nShe expressed dismay at the thought of an 80-year-old veteran forced to take a full-time job to afford housing. \"That's just not right. We should be valuing what they did for our country,\" Hammond said.\n\nAccording to Hammond, a former housing counselor at Delaware State Housing Authority, the limited support available to veterans often falls short, leaving them struggling to secure adequate housing. Even when they do find a place to live, it often doesn't meet their needs for support that goes beyond financial considerations.\n\nLOOKING FORWARD:How Delaware’s housing authorities are working to boost affordable housing\n\nCreating housing stability goes beyond financial support\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development defines \"affordable housing\" as costing no more than 30% of a resident's gross income. Hammond argues that while it can be helpful as a starting point, this metric doesn't account for real-world circumstances, such as unexpected bills and expenses, or family members who need support.\n\nHammond emphasized that it is the \"simple things\" that can make the difference between a tenant succeeding or struggling. According to the housing rights advocate, factoring these realities into the equation sets this affordable housing project apart.\n\n\"We're not just providing housing; we're creating a community,\" Hammond said.\n\nRent for the 21 units at the Southbridge Community Services Building is subsidized through the federal Housing and Urban Development's housing voucher program, commonly referred to as Section 8. Monthly rents for these units range from $200 to $800, with all utilities included except for Wi-Fi. Solar panels on the building’s roof generate enough electricity to help keep utility costs low.\n\nIn addition to providing affordable rents, Hammond and her family work to address minor obstacles that can lead to daily frustrations.\n\nTenants receive assistance with basic tasks, such as using the laundry machines, a microwave or the secure entry system, which can help maintain resident stability.\n\nTo make Wi-Fi setup easier, the Southbridge Community Services Building contracts with a local provider that offers Wi-Fi and straightforward access to customer service, rather than one that offers a complex menu of options.\n\nThe building is pet-friendly with no extra fees, recognizing that companionship is vital for seniors living alone. \"Having something to take care of, to be accountable for, to love you – that can make the difference in somebody's life,\" Hammond said.\n\nFor Moultre, it's the peaceful environment and Southbridge neighborhood that makes the biggest difference. \"It offered everything I needed in a home,\" he said.\n\nSmall-scale projects may also be a part of the solution\n\nChallenging the notion that only large-scale developments can address housing needs, the Southbridge Community Services Building offers several key lessons for affordable housing development. It starts with community engagement.\n\n\"Developers need to be intentional,\" Hammond said.\n\nHammond acknowledged that not everyone has the resources to build a 26-unit, $3 million affordable housing complex. She believes smaller efforts like partnering with an organization or developer to buy a single house and make it affordable can make a difference.\n\nBeyond individual projects, Hammond emphasized the need for broader, systemic support of affordable housing initiatives. She encourages housing advocates to engage with policymakers to shape program development and funding allocations.\n\nAs Delaware’s homelessness crisis grows, the Southbridge Community Services Building stands as an example of the affordable housing that many, like Moultre, are striving to access.\n\nYou can contact Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/09/02/wilmingtons-parks-rec-deputy-director-turns-focus-to-city-youth-melody-phillips/65462746007/", "title": "Wilmington's Parks and Rec deputy director turns focus to city youth", "text": "Raised in Southbridge, the new deputy director of Wilmington’s Parks and Recreation Department has been on the job for only one month but says she is already using her previous experience working with youth and her love for the community to make an impact.\n\nMelody Phillips, 42, joined the department on August 1. Her role oversees the day-to-day operations of Wilmington’s city parks, as well as supervising recreation centers.\n\nPhillips has worked in the programming industry for more than a decade. Most recently, she was the director at The Warehouse, a community hub for teenagers to access social and recreational activities in Northeast Wilmington.\n\nPhillips has also worked as a program manager at Delaware Technical Community College, where she helped build a GED and career pathway program for struggling youth between the ages of 16 to 24.\n\n“The program was really successful,\" Phillips said. \"We had a 72% completion rate and the requirement from the state was 67%.”\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:'Teen Warehouse' to provide opportunities for young people in Wilmington's Riverside neighborhood\n\nAs a native of the Southbridge neighborhood, Phillips developed a passion for serving youth and families in the Wilmington area. She prioritizes building communities and enhancing social justice initiatives.\n\n“Southbridge is home and that's where I grew up,\" Phillips said. \"People will often hear me rep Southbridge frequently because I still have a heart for it.\"\n\nIn addition to her programming background, Phillips started her own consulting firm in an effort to spark community action through grant writing and designed initiatives. She is also enrolled in the Chicago School of Professional Psychology's doctorate program and is in the process of completing her dissertation on co-developed youth and adult leadership models.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal caught up with Phillips to learn about her plans for the department and what she hopes to accomplish.\n\nThe following Q&A has been edited for length and clarity:\n\nQ: How did you become interested in the position and why do you want to help lead the department?\n\nA: I believe young people need to be in spaces and places where we can really elevate them to lead and so anytime I have an opportunity to do that — it’s a good day. Ironically enough after I resigned from the Teen Warehouse to start my own consulting firm, (Parks and Recreation) Director (Ian) Smith reached out to me to do an assessment of his leadership team. I met with them, did observations, conducted individual interviews to help understand their inner workings. Through this process, I also informed them of different ways that the Willam \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center could grow from a program standpoint.\n\nQ: How has your previous background in programming and consulting prepared you for this position?\n\nA: I’ve only been with this team for a few weeks now but I’m already tapping into a lot of that experience. For example, my community service work — because I’ve made some wonderful connections with both large and small grassroots and non-profits from across the city, I was able to reach out to a bunch of different partners and have them actively engage with a recent open house that we had. Having built those relationships and having that experience of running the Team Warehouse has helped me prepare.\n\nQ: What are some goals that you have for Wilmington?\n\nA: Increasing recreation and another goal is really developing a youth leadership program at the Hicks Anderson Community Center and bridging the gap between our senior centers on the first floor and the programs that run on the main level of the building, so that way our seniors could feel more included — we really want to make sure that they are being involved in the activities. This would also include doing a program where some of our young people interact with the seniors and help them understand the nuances of technology, which will help the digital divide that some of our seniors experience. I also heard from a lot of young people that they would love to have a music production studio at Hicks Anderson.\n\nQ: Are there any glaring issues in Wilmington that you want to address?\n\nA: One of the things that we identified especially that there are a lot of “food deserts” around the city — meaning there isn’t a local grocery store that is readily accessible. So one of the ideas that we have is expanding the community refrigerators that are popping up in the city. We are currently having conversations with the nonprofit, Planting to Feed, to potentially launch a community refrigerator in front of Hicks Community Center.\n\nQ: Are there any specific programs that you want to bring to community centers or parks around Wilmington?\n\nA: I think a priority will be making sure that the Wilmington area knows about the programs that are already available and having constant communication between all the community centers — all of them do an excellent job by offering programs to both youths and adults and even 12 and under. I think some sort of interactive calendar where we can place events of each others around the city would really impact how we can get more community members to support these events throughout the entire city.\n\nHave a tip or story ideas?

The group will work to turn tourism dollars into business opportunities, starting in the historically rich, yet economically disadvantaged Wilmington neighborhood of Southbridge.\n\n\"As part of our redevelopment efforts here, we want to grab onto three pillars: historic preservation, business development and economic development,\" said Travis Smith of the Southbridge Connects, one of several community groups that has joined the new committee. \"We want to use that as the framework, so the essence of the love, excitement and community that people felt from Southbridge over the years remains intact while creating jobs through these small businesses.\"\n\nIn 1857, Tubman and several escaped slaves hid near Southbridge when patrollers blocked the route across the Christina River. Wilmington was the last stop on the Underground Railroad before reaching the free state of Pennsylvania.\n\nDebra Martin, a preservation planner with the city, said the committee will begin meeting next month to examine possible revenue drivers for byway-affiliated businesses, including special coupons, grant opportunities and placing Underground Railroad artifacts in shops to promote foot traffic among tourists.\n\n\"We'll be looking at other byways throughout the country to find out what their best practices have been for promoting economic development and tourism,\" she said. \"We're going to put them all on the table and see what makes sense for us.\"\n\nThat effort began Tuesday with a walking tour of three Southbridge businesses that have received support from the SBA in recent months. Each of those shops received emblems identifying them as the state's first official byway-affiliated businesses.\n\n\"Hopefully, this helps bring people to the community and shows people that we have something valuable here,\" said Suzette Flemming, of Townsend, whose 3-month-old Harvest Christian Retail Store received the first emblem Tuesday. \"With all of the stigma that's been placed on this community, this is such a positive attribute and with the byway here is encouraging people to come through and really develop the community.\"\n\nBonnie White, a 26-year Southbridge resident who opened Ms. Bonnie's Savor the Flavors Seafood Restaurant on New Castle Avenue in early 2014, said raising awareness of the neighborhood's historic significance will have just as much impact on the community as a possible influx of tourism dollars.\n\n\"For me and the community, I think this helps us connect to our heritage, our roots,\" she said.\n\nIn the decade following her own escape in 1849, Tubman is believed to have escorted nearly 70 slaves along a network of secret routes and safe houses. A nearly 95-mile stretch runs from Sandtown in Kent County to Wilmington.\n\nIn 2010, Delaware commemorated that route by creating the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway, which connects a similar scenic byway in Maryland to Pennsylvania.\n\nSBA spokeswoman Jennifer Pilcher said the Delaware Byway Committee will initially focus on Southbridge because it includes a relatively concentrated number of small businesses, as well as a pre-existing redevelopment effort that includes plans for community gardens, streetscape improvements, new murals and a future farmers market.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/10/03/wilmington-one-hardest-places-achieve-american-dream-united-states/1490481002/", "title": "Wilmington ranks among hardest places to achieve American ...", "text": "In Wilmington, where about a quarter of the population lives in poverty and many lifelong residents barely make more than their parents, the American Dream has remained just that — a dream.\n\nWilmington is one of the hardest places to achieve economic mobility in the United States, a new tool from the U.S. Census Bureau shows. Deloras Alexander, who grew up in the Southbridge area, wasn't surprised that people who grow up there tend to get stuck.\n\nShe was standing near a group of benches on the corner of A Street surrounded by planters and trees — a \"park.\" Across the street is Dugan's Liquors, a corner store with security bars over the windows and trash on the sidewalk.\n\nSeveral houses on the street are boarded up and vacant. Elbert-Palmer Elementary School, about a block away, is frequently plagued by adults who stand outside and drink.\n\nPoverty and social mobility: Interactive map shows how Delaware neighborhoods fare\n\n\"We used to have community centers,\" Alexander said. \"We had things to do after school.\"\n\nNow, she said, she doesn't even want her grandkids going to their feeder school. Instead, they go to Odyssey Charter. There, her 5-year-old grandson is learning Greek, Alexander said. He worries about his grandma and wishes she were better off.\n\n\"That's my little man,\" Alexander said, recalling how the little boy recently said to her: \"Nana, I have some money here to help you pay some bills.\"\n\n\"I told him to keep it,\" she said.\n\nBehind her, another Southbridge resident shook her head in disgust.\n\n\"I'm not poor,\" she said, upset that anyone would even insinuate Southbridge residents are.\n\nAnd she's right. Not everyone in Southbridge is considered low-income. About 30 percent are; some parts of Wilmington are closer to 50 percent.\n\nMayor Mike Purzycki said the city has taken steps toward improving economic mobility in Wilmington as a whole. For two years now, it has held a Historically Black Colleges and Universities fair for local high-schoolers, connecting nearly 250 students them with more than $1 million in scholarships this year, he said.\n\nADDING JOBS AND REDUCING BLIGHT\n\nPurzycki unveilsplan to 'stabilize' Wilmington's West Center City\n\n76ers, developer team up to build Wilmington arena\n\nWilmington student getsfull ride in less than 20 minutes\n\nPrivatizing the Port of Wilmington will create good-paying blue collar jobs for city residents, he added, while the new 76ers Fieldhouse has created \"hundreds of new construction jobs.\" He also talked about efforts to draw new businesses to the downtown and the Riverfront.\n\n\"We are also making progress in the area of neighborhood stabilization — reducing crime and attacking blight — first in West Center City and then on to other distressed neighborhoods,\" Purzycki said in a written statement. \"This effort will pay dividends in the long-term as well as the short-term because a stable place to live is tied directly to a person’s ability to achieve employment and prosperity.\"\n\nRead Mayor Mike Purzycki's full statement at the bottom of this page.\n\nWhen you first open the new U.S. Census tool, known as \"The Opportunity Atlas,\" it's hard to tell what you're looking at. It's a massive map, with splotches of blue, green, yellow, orange and red.\n\nWhen you zoom in, you're looking at household income for people born between 1978 and 1983 to low-income parents in the United States.\n\nIn areas that are more red, people who grew up poor tended to stay poor. In areas that are more blue, people who grew up in low-income households are making more money than their parents did.\n\nIsn't that the definition of the American Dream? Being able to achieve upward social mobility through hard work, determination and initiative?\n\nYeah, 48-year-old Keysha Peak nodded.\n\nShe lives in Southbridge, too, which stretches from South Market Street to the Port of Wilmington. According to the Opportunity Atlas, the average 2014-15 income for children born in that area, who are now in their mid-30s, is only $14,000.\n\nIn other parts of the city, it ranges from $15,000 to $32,000. If you exclude Highlands and Trolley Square, the highest average household income for the group drops to $26,000 in Canby Park.\n\nAbout 60 percent of residents who live in Southbridge are employed. About 86 percent of those are from low-income families who have never left Wilmington and 81 percent are minorities, according to the Opportunity Atlas.\n\nNowhere else in Delaware is there so little economic mobility. It's hard to find many places in the United States where those who grew up in low-income families are making as little as $14,000 a year.\n\nOne place is Bethel, Alaska, a rural community with fewer than 6,100 residents. Another is the north side of Pittsburgh. Salaries don't fall that low in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., or Detroit, though they come close.\n\nDepending on the size of individual households, that could translate into living below the poverty line. The federal poverty level for an individual living in the United States is currently $12,140. For a family of four, it's $25,100.\n\nPeak, said: \"It seems that people who grow up here get stuck here.\"\n\nShe was standing in front of her great-grandmother's house on South Claymont Street. Now her mom lives there, she said.\n\nPeak left Wilmington for a while but just moved back, into a house across the street.\n\n\"It's funny that I'm right back here,\" she said. \"Nothing's changed.\"\n\nA lot of the people she went to high school with still live in Southbridge, though some have become addicted to drugs and some have died. Many community members also abuse alcohol, she said.\n\nPeak, whose 8-year-old son goes to Elbert Palmer, hopes she can move back out of the neighborhood soon, in part because her son is afraid to go outside or play at the park and has gained 30 pounds due to the lack of exercise.\n\n\"These kids, it's horrible in this neighborhood,\" she said. \"They break bottles and curse.\"\n\nCynthia Williams, youth coordinator at the Neighborhood House on B Street, described a neighborhood where few families ever leave. Residents tend to own houses instead of rent and pass property down to their children.\n\nReal estate listings show that houses in the neighborhood are valued fairly low or are in pre-foreclosure, which would make it difficult to sell them and get enough money for a new one.\n\nThe Neighborhood House has before- and after-school programs and serves about 40 kids at a time. Joanne Parker-Henry, the programs' supervisor, said things are bad all over and refused to condemn Southbridge as a bad place to live.\n\nIf she thought in terms of how much better children were doing than their parents \"I couldn't be here,\" she said.\n\nParker-Henry said her staff instead focuses on helping children realize their dreams.\n\n\"If you have somebody that inspires you to do better, you can get out,\" she said. \"That's why we're here.\"\n\nThe Southbridge Civic Association holds events, like Southbridge Weekend, with fun activities for residents of all ages. It was canceled this year due to bad weather, but organizers said on Facebook that they hope to bring it back next summer with a full week of fun events.\n\nLeslie Newman, CEO of the Delaware nonprofit Children and Families First, suggested an approach similar that being taken in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nA task force there has identified early childhood development, college and career readiness, family stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhance upward mobility, according to National Public Radio.\n\nMecklenburg County, where the city is located, has committed to providing pre-K for all children. The city has a $50 million bond issue for affordable housing on the November ballot, and matching private donations could boost the total to over $100 million.\n\n\"We need to follow Charlotte’s example of coming together,\" Newman said, also stressing the value of parent-child relationships.\n\nChildren and Families First has several programs for new parents and families, which focus on developing healthy habits during and post pregnancy, positive parenting skills, building community schools, financial literacy and more.\n\n“I believe that the secret sauce is the two-gen approach,\" Newman said. \"It’s the family and the children. We have to have parents be successful, and we have to have kids be successful and we have to help forge the bond between the two.”\n\nThe idea is to counteract the effects of so-called adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse, mental illness, domestic violence, divorce, physical and emotional neglect and more. There are also adverse community environments, such as poverty, discrimination, poor housing, violence and others that can have huge impacts on children's future health and well-being.\n\nEven if you have a good home life, you can be impacted by toxic stressors in your community, Newman said.\n\n“We now know that those negative experiences can impact your brain, how your brain looks,\" she said, describing how some children have trouble as adults trusting and bonding with people. That, in turn, weakens their ability to meet goals, hold down a job, regulate their emotions and more.\n\n“Their brain development is different than a child that lives in circumstances that don’t have that toxic stress.”\n\nMORE FROM DELAWAREONLINE\n\nNew Delaware restaurants: Lots coming in fall 2018 and later\n\nGeorge Thorogood cancels next week's sold out Grand show\n\nWilmington council email: What can 'be done' about president's parking ticket?\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Gov. John Carney announced the state is contributing $1 million to the effort. Mayor Mike Purzycki said the city plans to pay a similar amount, though the sum has yet to be finalized with City Council.\n\nThe rest will be financed through low income housing tax credits, donations and grants, Purzycki said.\n\nHe anticipates $100 million will be invested in Riverside during the course of the project.\n\n“That’s a massive infusion of investment into this side of town,” he said.\n\nWhat is Purpose Built Communities?\n\nPurpose Built Communities, the consulting nonprofit, was founded nearly a decade ago to replicate revitalization strategies used in the neighborhood of East Lake in Atlanta, Georgia, where crime and poverty were high.\n\nBacked by deep-pocketed donors such as Warren Buffet, the organization has helped start similar plans in cities like Houston and Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nWilmington became the latest site Tuesday, when the organization’s president and local project leaders signed an agreement at a packed news conference at Kingswood.\n\nPurzycki and Charles McDowell, CEO of EastSide Charter School's foundation, became interested in the partnership in 2014, two years before Purzycki was elected mayor.\n\nThey visited East Lake, where crime is down and educational performance has “rocketed,” Purzycki said.\n\nI-95 neighbors want 'roof' over highway\n\nThe project requires the creation of a new nonprofit, Reach Riverside, of which Herring will be CEO and McDowell its board chair. Other board members include Delaware State University provost Tony Allen and Rob Buccini, co-president of the city's largest developer.\n\n“This isn’t just a housing project,” Purzycki said. “Its strength is the building of a community, not just bricks and mortar.”\n\nWhat does Riverside get?\n\nOfficials have long wanted to redevelop Riverside, a low-income neighborhood bordered by the Brandywine River, railroad tracks and a state prison.\n\nOfficials Tuesday touted the success of Wilmington’s own Village of Eastlake, a public housing project nicknamed “the Bucket” that was a hub of drug dealing and other crimes.\n\nIt was torn down in the early 2000s and replaced with a mix of public housing and privately owned homes.\n\nThe Wilmington Housing Authority hoped to do the same to its units in Riverside, the News Journal reported in 2011. But a federal grant from the Housing and Urban Development agency was not awarded.\n\nSouthbridge residents say they're tired of being a dumping ground\n\nNow, those plans get another chance.\n\nKingswood will allow its 12 acres of land to be joined with the Wilmington Housing Authority’s adjacent 25 acres, where it runs 293 units of public housing.\n\nThe plans are for the housing authority and Pennrose, a Philadelphia-based developer, to tear down the existing units and build about 400 new mixed-income housing units.\n\nAbout a third of those units will be market-rate, with the rest being subsidized. WHA director John Hill promised a “seamless transition” for current public housing residents who may be moved to other units while construction happens.\n\n“The residents will be protected in this process,” he said. “When we move residents it will be at the expense of the Housing Authority and its partners.”\n\nElsewhere in Riverside, the EastSide Charter School plans to add a high school, graduate 100 percent of its new seniors and prepare them for college or a career, as part of the Purpose Built model’s “cradle-to-college” education strategy.\n\nWill residents support it?\n\nThe groups want buy-in from neighbors.\n\nWhen mixed-income housing was proposed in Riverside in 2011, some residents were worried they would be pushed out.\n\nHerring announced the new plans to Riverside residents before making the public announcement, hoping to address similar concerns.\n\n“We’re definitely facing those fears,” Herring said. “We're going to walk them through every step of the way to ease any fears or unknowns they might have.”\n\nReach Riverside added two neighborhood residents to its board. Another resident, Gina Watson, who said at the news conference that she visited East Lake in Atlanta, urged her neighbors to get involved in the redevelopment so project planners know what residents want.\n\n“I know it’s scary, change is a paralyzing process for some people,” she said. “The biggest partner in all of this is going to be the residents and that’s pretty much what I saw.”\n\nOn Tuesday, residents at the news conference were hopeful.\n\nLongtime residents Ronald and Cheryl Deaton called the redevelopment overdue.\n\n“I hope young people can get jobs and help advance the area,” Ronald Deaton said. “It’s long overdue.”\n\nBeatrice Patton Dixon, one of the resident board members, said she believes the plans can give a downtrodden neighborhood hope.\n\n“The spirit, I hope it’s going to spread,” she said.\n\nContact Jeanne Kuang at jkuang@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2476.

Madden advocated for the commission's clients, whom he called \"our guys,\" by encouraging them to be better fathers, sons and men in general, she said.\n\n\"He has a heart and a passion that the community recognized,\" she said.\n\nTaylor, who is president and chief executive officer of United Way of Delaware, said the board has started an \"aggressive search\" for a replacement. A position description will be released next week, and a search committee will review qualified candidates. Taylor said a decision should be made within 90 days.\n\n\"We're looking for someone that has great leadership and management skills and great relationships, someone that has a passion for the population that we serve, that is genuine and rooted around community change,\" Taylor said.\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

Using self-reported height and weight information, Gallup officials computed Delaware's obesity rate at 34 percent, above the national average of 27 percent.\n\nPublic health officials caution that while the poll isn't scientific – and leaves plenty of room for error in a state as small as Delaware – it's a reminder that more needs to be done to encourage and sustain a healthy lifestyle.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, said data from the annual behavioral risk survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest obesity rates have plateaued in the First State in recent years. There also are signs of a slight increase in physical activity among residents.\n\n\"We are usually around the national average or slightly worse,\" Rattay said. \"We still have a problem.\"\n\nCommunity efforts\n\nSome of that increase in physical activity might be the result of an effort among several municipalities to promote physical activity and other healthy lifestyle choices. Middletown, Seaford and Newark are among the communities developing outdoor programs.\n\nNext week, the city of Newark will boost its existing efforts with the kickoff of its Healthy Newark initiative. The focus is promoting healthy activities and lifestyle options in the college town through social media and the hashtag #HealthyNewarkDE.\n\n\"There's a need for Delaware local governments to get involved and improve their built environment,\" said Marcia Scott, a policy scientist with the University of Delaware Institute for Public Administration. \"We really need municipalities to look beyond land use plans.\"\n\nRattay said that kind of community approach can make a difference, though the results can take years to see. The goal is to make a healthy lifestyle the default – with walking paths, pedestrian friendly sidewalks and access to fresh fruits and vegetables – rather than something that has to be sought out.\n\n\"We don't have a state of individuals who have simply lost willpower. It is more difficult to make the healthy choices,\" Rattay said. \"The best way to really support people making healthy choices is by taking a comprehensive approach. It is having community leaders and a variety of stakeholders looking at what are the greatest barriers in our individual community.\"\n\nLast summer, the state's Council on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention recognized seven Delaware municipalities for their work on promoting community health. The awards were intended to highlight community efforts to improve access to health-based services, provide spaces for safe and appropriate physical activity, reduce tobacco use and encourage healthy eating, Rattay said.\n\nA collaborative approach\n\nMiddletown, Newark, Seaford, Wilmington, New Castle, Bethany Beach and Dover were recognized for taking a collaborative approach to creating a healthy lifestyle. Among their efforts: banning smoking in parks, encouraging students to walk to school, adding a bus stop near a grocery store and requiring new housing developments to connect to existing shopping and neighborhoods to encourage walking and biking.\n\nScott said the efforts also reflect many of the recommendations found in the Toolkit for a Healthy Delaware, a website developed by the University of Delaware's Institute for Public Administration (ipa.udel.edu/healthyDEtoolkit).\n\n\"The way we are building communities is not like how we used to build communities. It used to be pedestrian-oriented and built like on a grid. In this era of suburbanization, everything became car-oriented. The whole thing created a perfect storm for this epidemic of obesity,\" said Scott, who co-authored a resource guide that formed the basis for the online toolkit.\n\nUnique challenges\n\nEach community has its individual needs, Rattay said. A community approach encourages other stakeholders – such as the local church, school or senior center – to be part of the solution.\n\n\"They have to be tailored to what their greatest barriers are. If you don't have a walkable community, why not? Is violence an issue?\" Rattay said. \"Do we need better lighting or can we make changes that can make people feel much safer?\"\n\nIn Wilmington's Southbridge community, residents wanted more access to healthy foods, especially for people who don't drive. The addition of a bus stop near the ShopRite grocery store was a relatively simple change that reaped big benefits, Rattay said.\n\nEven the relatively easy change to make water more available in the Delaware State Parks as part of its \"Munch Better\" campaign made a difference. In the two years the project was studied, water was the best-selling beverage.\n\nScott cited Bethany Beach and Newark's Main Street as examples of locations that encourage active living. The two locales blend commercial and residential properties while offering trails, community exercise programs and other outdoor amenities.\n\nIt's that kind of outlook that Newark hopes to celebrate through its Healthy Newark partnership. The initiative was developed by the city's parks and recreation department, the Downtown Newark Partnership and Fusion Fitness Center. The campaign runs through April 11.\n\nBut community doesn't just have to be made up of geographical neighbors. One arm of the Healthier Sussex County Initiative is relying on a virtual community to increase physical activity and encourage healthy choices among residents in southern Delaware.\n\nIt joined the charitable giving site Plus 3 Network, which tallies exercise and converts it into points redeemed in dollars by corporate sponsors.\n\nParticipants are earning money for Sussex Outdoors, a public awareness campaign made up of Bayhealth's Milford Memorial Hospital, Beebe Healthcare and Nanticoke Health Services.\n\nSo far, the exercise campaign has raised almost $5,000, said John Hollis, Sussex manager of community and government affairs for Nemours Health & Prevention Services.\n\n\"It's a great incentive,\" he said.\n\nContact Kelly Bothum at (302) 324-2962 or kbothum@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/30/after-five-shot-five-days-violent-end-2019-prompts-further-discussion-wilmington-gun-violence/2773350001/", "title": "5 shot in 5 days: Wilmington's violent end to 2019 brings back calls ...", "text": "The year 2019 is ending with a troubling spate of shootings in Wilmington, even as many residents desperately stress that the city should not be defined by the violence plaguing its poorest neighborhoods.\n\nA total of 112 people were struck by gunfire in 2019, well below a historic high in 2017, but above a low experienced last year.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/12/09/response-gun-violence-unchanged-wilmington-hits-homicide-record/6419617001/", "title": "Response to violent crime unchanged as Wilmington hits new ...", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the number of shooting fatalities in 2017.

Just on the odds alone, De La Salle should be favored. Hey, it’s been 15 straight games that the Cubs have beaten De La Salle and one of these days the Pilots are going to wake up and knocked the socks off the Cubs. But SOS’s crystal ball says it won’t be this day. DUD Jesuit 57, De La Silly 54.\n\nFlint Carman-Ainsworth (23-2) vs. Clarkston (23-1) at Grand Blanc. Clarkston needed to rally from a 12-point, fourth-quarter deficit to beat Carman by five in the second game of the season. The Wolves will have to keep Carman’s big three – Omari Duncan, Mike Fletcher and Ja’Kavien Lewis – in check. Carman might want make sure Foster Loyer doesn’t take over the game again, and they better not sleep on Taylor Currie or CJ Robinson, who are both capable of posting big numbers. Last Train to Clarksville 68. Carman Miranda 62.\n\nEast Lansing (22-3) vs. Holland West Ottawa (23-2) at Lansing Eastern. Brandon Johns has had a terrific tournament run and this should be the time East Lansing breaks through and posts a monumental victory. But SOS feels the same way about West Ottawa, which he saw beat Muskegon in the regional final. The most impressive part of that game was that West Ottawa was 20-for-20 at the free throw line. West Otta Here 64, East Izzo 60.\n\nBelleville (20-5) vs. Novi (16-8) at Calihan Hall. Forgive SOS, but it’s about time that these two teams finally woke up. For the longest time, it looked like neither team was going to get its act together. But Traveon Maddux Jr. has been sensational for Novi to key this run. Belleville was in line to be the state’s most under achieving team, but the Tigers are exactly where he expected them to be. Gabe Brown has to own the glass for Belleville and Davion Williams has to just be Davion. Belle Tire 64, Number VI 62.\n\nClass B\n\nBenton Harbor (24-1) vs. Williamston (22-2) at Ionia. Benton Harbor has a terrific player in sophomore Carlos Johnson, who can be a beast in the post and dominate the backboards. And then there is also TJ Jones, who can burn you from beyond the arc. Williamston can’t match Johnson, but two years ago it knocked off defending state champ Wyoming Godwin Heights and Cole Kleiver is ready to help post another upset. Elliot Uzelac High 58, Williamston Settlement 57.\n\nDearborn Divine Child (18-6) vs. River Rouge (23-1) at Chelsea. DC will have the best player on the floor in Quinn Blair, but Detroit Old Redford also had the best player on the floor in Rocket Watts when River Rouge beat them in the regional final. Rouge won the regional and it will win the quarterfinal, as long as Nigel Colvin has another big day for the Panthers. Rouge River 61, Divine Intervention 59.\n\nNew Haven (25-0) vs. Bridgeport (24-1) at Corunna. Bridgeport has SOS’s favorite basketball name in SirQuarius Ball, and he can ball by the way. And so can his teammate Charles Garrett. But New Haven has a guy named Romeo Weems, who gave new meaning to the term stat-stuffer. All he did in the regional final was score 21 points with 16 rebounds, 12 assists 10 seals and seven blocks. He may need work on blocking shots. New Heaven 72, A Bridge Topo Far 66.\n\nGrand Rapids Catholic Central (22-2) vs. Boyne City (19-6) at Big Rapids. This is Boyne City’s first Class B quarterfinal ever, which is a big accomplishment. Now all it has to do is figure out how to stop CC’s 6-foot-10 Mr. Basketball finalist Marcus Bingham Jr. and then there is 6-8 Jacob Polakovich, who is also capable of dominating a game. Tough deal. Catholic in Grand Rapids? 68, Boiiiiingggg 59.\n\nClass C\n\nDetroit Edison (14-10) vs. Unionville-Sebewaing (25-0) at West Bloomfield. What an upset USA pulled off last week, knocking off three-time defending champ Flint Beecher with all five starters playing every minute in the regional final. USA may need to go to its bench because Edison’s pace can wear out a team and so can its size – 6-8 Deante Johnson and 6-5 Gary Solomon. And then there is do-it-all guard Pierre Mitchell. Electricity 63, Born in the USA! 59.\n\nGrand Rapids Covenant Christian (21-4) vs. Sanford Meridian (21-3) at Central Montcalm. Meridian's Garrett Stockford may not be another Ron Fillmore, but who is? He is good enough to give defenses migraines. Covenant Christian returns four starters from the team that lost in the state finals last March. It played a schedule this season to get back to The Bres, which it will do. Arc of the Covenant 59, Sanford and Son 54.\n\nKalamazoo Christian (23-2) vs. Monroe St. Mary Catholic Central (24-0) at Kalamazoo Loy Norrix. C.J. Haut can control the boards and score inside while Hunter Kegley is dangerous on the perimeter, which makes St. Mary CC difficult to defend. Christian will need to play some amazing defense, which is exactly what it did in the regional final, holding Cassopolis scoreless in the final 5:26. Ray Lauwers High 66, Kangaroo Christian 60.\n\nMaple City Glen Lake (22-2) vs. Iron Mountain (23-1) at Petoskey, 6. Glen Lake better be ready for Iron Mountain’s press because sooner or later it’s coming. It also might want to be ready for freshman Foster Wonders, who may be the best Foster since Loyer. Glen Lake has a trio of bombers in Reece Hazelton, Cade Peterson and Xander Okerlund, who apparently learned to shoot from watching Don Miller, the oldest junior varsity coach in North America. Maple Syrup 68, Izzo’s Mountain 61.\n\nClass D\n\nCedarville (21-3) vs. Dollar Bay (25-0) at Escanaba. The way SOS sees it, if Jaden Janke and Devin Schmitz are the two best players ever at Dollar Bay – or at least two of the best – they deserve the chance to play at The Bres. SOS understands that Cedarville’s Tristan Masuga and Chase Fisher may not agree, but after all, these are SOS’s predictions. Dollar Bill 62, Les Cheneaux Islands 59.\n\nSouthfield Christian (20-4) vs. Flint International (23-2) at Goodrich. Calling all Flintstones! Get to Goodrich ASAP because it is going to take a bunch of you to beat this Southfield Christian team. Senior Bryce Washington is really good and junior Harlond Beverly has offers from Michigan State, Xavier, Northwestern and a bunch of other schools. Onward Christian Soldiers 68, Flint International Airport 52.\n\nMarcellus Howardsville Christian (20-5) vs. Hillsdale Academy (23-2) at Portage Northern. Hillsdale Academy’s Spencer Moeggenberg can be a defensive stopper and he will have his hands full trying to defend Dylan Jergens, who can score with the best of them. Hillsdale has two potential big-time scorers in Peter Kalthoff and Lukas Tharp and that could be enough to get to The Bres. Academy on the Hill 61, Marcelle Carruthers 58.\n\nBuckley (19-5) vs. Hillman (24-0) at Gaylord. Hillman has had a tremendous season, but we’ve been here with Buckley before. A year ago, Buckley got to the state finals and darn near knocked off three-time state champ Powers North Central. SOS has been waiting for Denver Cade and Joey Weber to get things in gear this season and here they are. Belt Buckles 58, Over the Hill, Man 53.\n\nMick McCabe (err, Son of Swami) is a former longtime high school sports columnist for the Free Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/19"}, {"url":

The meeting between the outgoing president and his successor was an awkward post-election ritual that took place despite the personal animosity between the two men.\n\nBiden has spent months calling Trump a threat to democracy. Trump has repeatedly called Biden the worst president ever.\n\nBut with the election behind them, Biden phoned Trump last week to congratulate him on his win and invite him to Washington – a courtesy that Trump refused to extend to him after Biden defeated him in 2020.\n\nComplicating matters further, Biden had wanted another four years as president but changed his mind after his most recent face-to-face meeting with Trump – on a debate stage in Atlanta in June. The debate went so poorly for Biden that he abandoned his reelection campaign a month later, and Harris stepped in as the Democratic nominee.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nTrump also met with lawmakers on Wednesday as they held elections for some of Congress' pivotal leadership roles.\n\nKeep up with live updates from the USA TODAY Network.\n\nWhite House: Biden reinforced need to stand with Ukraine\n\nPresident Joe Biden stressed to President-elect Donald Trump the importance of continuing to stand with Ukraine in its war with Russia, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said.\n\nDuring their nearly two-hour meeting, Biden reinforced his belief that a strong and stable Europe is in the U.S.'s interest and will keep the U.S. from getting dragged directly into a future war, Sullivan said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the meeting between Biden and Trump as “substantive” and said they exchanged views on national security and domestic policy issues facing the nation and the world. Trump came with a detailed set of questions, she said.\n\nBiden also raised important items on Congress's to do-list for the lame-duck session, including funding the government and providing the funding that he has requested for disaster relief, Jean-Pierre said. Biden also reiterated his intention to make sure there is an orderly and peaceful transfer of power, she said.\n\n−Michael Collins\n\nTrump, Biden meet for nearly two hours\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump and outgoing President Joe Biden met at the White House for nearly two hours Wednesday, signifying a peaceful transfer of power four years after Trump left in protest following his loss to Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe two men began their Oval Office meeting at 11:07 a.m. ET and ended around 1 p.m. ET.\n\nTrump exited the White House from the South Lawn by motorcade without addressing hundreds of reporters who were waiting outside the West Wing on the opposite side of the building.\n\nTrump was joined by his incoming White House chief of staff, 2024 campaign manager Susie Wiles, while Biden was accompanied by Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, according to the White House.\n\nAt least one other Trump aide also appeared to be on hand. Stephen Miller, a top Trump immigration adviser and incoming deputy chief of staff for policy, posted a photo of the White House Rose Garden as the meeting took place.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump upon return to White House: 'It's a nice world today.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden congratulated President-elect Donald Trump as the two began a highly anticipated meeting at the White House one week after Trump’s election victory.\n\n“Well, Mr. President-elect and former president, Donald,” Biden said as he shook Trump’s hand. “Congratulations, and I’m looking forward to having, like we said, a smooth transition, doing everything we can to make sure you’re accommodated, get what you need.”\n\nBiden said they will have a chance to discuss some of these matters in their meeting.\n\n“Welcome,” Biden said.\n\nTrump thanked Biden for a smooth transition. It’s the president-elect’s first trip to the White House since his first term ended in January 2021.\n\n“Politics is tough, and it’s in many cases not a nice world, but it is a nice world today, and I appreciate it very much,” Trump said. “A transition that’s so smooth, it will be as smooth as it can get. And I very much appreciate that, Joe.”\n\nReporters were escorted out of the Oval Office after less than one minute as Biden and Trump began their meeting.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJeff Zients, Susie Wiles attend Oval Office meeting\n\nPresident Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have some company in their Oval Office meeting.\n\nWhite House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and Susie Wiles, who Trump has tapped to be his chief of staff, are attending the meeting, the White House said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nJill Biden gives Donald Trump congratulatory letter for Melania Trump\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden gave President-elect Donald Trump a handwritten letter to deliver to Melania Trump as the former president returned to the White House for the first time since leaving four years ago.\n\nThe White House said Jill Biden’s letter congratulated Melania Trump and expressed her team’s readiness to assist with the transition.\n\nMelania Trump, the incoming first lady, did not join her husband for his post-election visit to the White House, as is customary. Her office did not provide a reason for her absence but said she wishes Trump “great success.”\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nDonald Trump's meeting with Joe Biden begins\n\nThe meeting between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is underway.\n\nThe meeting began in the Oval Office at 11:07 a.m., according to the White House.\n\n−Michael Collins\n\nTrump appoints four campaign aides to serve as White House deputies\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is filling out his White House leadership team, announcing deputy chief of staff roles Wednesday for top campaign aides Stephen Miller, James Blair, Dan Scavino and Taylor Budowich.\n\nDescribed as “one of President Trump’s longest serving and most trusted aides,” Scavino will have the title of deputy chief of staff and assistant to the president. Miller will be deputy chief of staff for policy and Homeland Security adviser, while Blair will be deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs. Budowich will be deputy chief of staff for communications and personnel.\n\nMiller and Scavino served in Trump’s first administration. Miller has been one of the chief architects for Trump’s immigration policies. Trump earlier appointed campaign chief Susie Wiles as his chief of staff in the next administration.\n\n−Zac Anderson\n\nMelania Trump won't visit White House with Donald Trump\n\nMelania Trump is skipping the tea.\n\nA day after it became clear that Donald Trump would return as president after his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden invited the president-elect and his wife to the White House.\n\nDonald Trump accepted the invitation the same day, saying through his spokesperson that he \"looked forward to the meeting.\" Melania Trump remained silent.\n\nOn Wednesday, she announced she won’t be taking tea with Jill Biden.\n\n“Her husband’s return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,” Melania Trump's office said in a statement on X.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden to emphasize 'peaceful transition' with Donald Trump meeting\n\nBiden’s message during Wednesday’s meeting with Trump is simple, according to the White House: This is what a peaceful transfer of power looks like.\n\n\"He wants to show the American people that the system works, to trust the institutions, to trust that the norms do matter here,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday. “He is showing by leadership what a peaceful transition looks like.\"\n\nThe meeting comes four years after Trump refused to concede his 2020 election loss to Biden and instead lobbed wild and baseless conspiracy theories to try to overturn the election. Trump’s efforts culminated with the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters seeking to stop Congress from counting the electoral votes.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nDoes Joe Biden still believe Donald Trump is a 'threat to democracy'?\n\nBiden warned Americans repeatedly this year that Trump is a “threat to democracy” after Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe president will now get the chance to say whether he still believes that’s the case when he meets with Trump late Wednesday morning in the Oval Office.\n\nThat question is almost certain to be shouted among reporters who will be in the room briefly before the meeting gets underway.\n\nWhile Biden was at his beach home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, over the weekend, he was posed the question and deflected. \"I’m going to see him on Wednesday,” Biden said in response.\n\nDuring a post-election speech last week from the White House Rose Garden, Biden told supporters: “We're going to be OK, but we need to stay engaged.”\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked last week whether Biden still believes Trump is a threat to democracy, said: “What we are trying to do is respect what the American people decided. We’re not trying to create any division here.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWill Melania Trump take tea with Jill Biden?\n\nA meeting between the president-elect and the current president isn’t the only post-election tradition in American politics. For more than a century, it has been customary for the first lady to host tea with her successor.\n\nSo will Melania Trump meet with First Lady Jill Biden on Wednesday?\n\nDon’t count on it.\n\nSeveral news outlets have reported the former and future first lady will skip Jill Biden’s tea invitation, bucking White House tradition for the second time in four years. The Trumps did not host the Bidens in the White House after Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy and Michael Collins\n\nHow to watch Trump's visit to Washington\n\nUSA TODAY will be live streaming coverage of Donald Trump's visit to Washington.

One with President Joe Biden, who announced on Sunday that he was ending his reelection bid, and another with Vice President Kamala Harris, who's expected to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket.\n\n\"Mr. President, we've known each other for 40 years, and you've known every Israeli prime minister for 50 years,\" Netanyahu said to Biden ahead of their meeting in the Oval Office.\n\n\"From a proud Jew Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the State of Israel,\" he said. \"And I look forward to discussing with you today and working with you in the months ahead.\"\n\nBiden recalled the first Israeli prime minister he met was Golda Meir, back when he was a senator. \"That was so far back, I was only 12,\" he joked.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nAn invitation to the White House had evaded Netanyahu since Biden and Harris took office. A meeting last year took place during the United Nations General Assembly in New York. After the Israelis said one had been issued and accepted for Monday, Biden tested positive for COVID and went into quarantine. He returned to the White House on Tuesday.\n\nBiden has a complicated relationship with Netanyahu, who opposes longtime U.S. efforts to create a Palestinian state. He was openly critical of controversial judicial reforms that Netanyahu's government pushed before Hamas attacked Israel last October. Since then, Biden has been supportive of Israel's right to defend itself while at times condemning its conduct in the war.\n\nHarris has been harsher. She warned Netanyahu in December that civilian casualties in Gaza were unacceptably high. She called for an immediate cease-fire in March.\n\nOn Thursday, Harris, whose husband is Jewish, told reporters that her meeting with Netanyahu had been \"frank.\" She expressed her commitment to Israel but said she also remains concerned about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, “including the death of far too many innocent civilians.”\n\nHarris said she also told the Israeli prime minister that it's time to finish the ceasefire and hostage plan that Biden detailed at the end of May.\n\nWill there be a ceasefire?Biden, Harris to press Netanyahu on Israel-Hamas war\n\nMore than 20 calls with Netanyahu\n\nHarris speaks regularly with Israeli President Issac Herzog, the official said, and met with him in person once. She has also sat in on more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu delivered a previously announced address on Wednesday to a joint meeting of Congress. Dozens of Democratic members of Congress boycotted the speech over mounting civilian deaths in Gaza, while protestors clashed with police outside the U.S. Capitol and released maggots inside of a conference room at the Watergate hotel where the Israeli leader has been staying.\n\nHarris did not preside over those remarks in her role as president of the Senate. The aide said it was due to her plans to be in Indianapolis at a Zeta Phi Beta Sorority event. She's the keynote speaker at the historically African American sorority's conference.\n\nAfter his meeting with Biden on Thursday, the Israeli prime minister and the U.S. president met with the families of Americans who are being held hostage by Hamas. Netanyahu met earlier in the week with the families in Washington. So did White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.\n\nNetanyahu will also sit down on Friday with Donald Trump at the 2024 Republican presidential nominee's Florida estate after he leaves Washington, the former president said. Trump is in a close race for the presidency with Harris, polling on the match-up shows.\n\nAt the White House, the sitting leaders were expected to discuss the ceasefire and hostage plan that Biden detailed in May and negotiators have continued to pursue in hopes it will bring about an eventual end to the war.\n\n\"These are difficult, complex issues.

Biden will “discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts,” during the NATO summit and reaffirm the US’ commitment to its NATO allies, Psaki said.\n\n“He will also join a scheduled European Council summit to discuss our shared concerns about Ukraine, including trans-Atlantic efforts to impose economic costs on Russia, provide humanitarian support to those affected by the violence and address other challenges related to the conflict,” she said.\n\nPsaki noted the President is a “big believer in face-to-face diplomacy,” and his goal is to meet with European counterparts in person to discuss “where we are at this point” with regard to the invasion.\n\n“We’ve been incredibly aligned to date – that doesn’t happen by accident,” Psaki said.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted earlier on Tuesday: “I have convened an extraordinary Summit on 24 March at #NATO HQ.

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor far too long, the United States has treated Africa as an afterthought, much to Washington’s peril. US leaders have allowed rivals like China and Russia to deepen their ties – both economic and political – while America twiddles its thumbs on the sidelines.\n\nThat’s why this week’s three day US-Africa summit, which got underway on Tuesday, is so important. It’s an opportunity to make up for lost time and reconnect with a continent that Secretary of State Antony Blinken rightly calls a “major geopolitical force.”\n\nJoyce M. Davis Courtesy Dan Gleiter\n\nChina’s trade with Africa reached a high of more than $254 billion last year. US trade with Africa is only a fraction of that, at only about $64 billion. And warmongering Russia is now the continent’s largest arms dealer,with major influence in many African countries. These ties have real-life repercussions for American interests abroad. One case in point, Africa’s strong military relations with Russia have muted the continent’s criticism of the invasion of Ukraine, to the dismay of the US and much of the world.\n\nThese relationships didn’t just spring up overnight. They have been more than a decade in the making. American leaders have allowed these and other global powers to gain valuable footholds on the continent, potentially threatening our own interests around the world. That was a mistake, and one that President Joe Biden seems ready to rectify.\n\nForty-nine nations have been invited to the President’s summit in Washington this week. But Biden knows a photo op around a banquet table with African leaders won’t make up for the time the US has foolishly squandered since 2014, when President Barack Obama held the first US-Africa summit at the White House. That brought hope for a new, stronger relationship, which just didn’t happen. This week’s gathering is a chance to change that.\n\nBiden seems determined to make the most of the opportunity to invigorate American leadership by proposing that the African Union join the G20. South Africa is the only African member of the G20. It’s time to change that. (And as long as we’re at it, it’s also time for African states to have a stronger voice at the United Nations. Biden has floated the idea of Africa having a voice in the Security Council. And why not?)\n\nThe administration earlier this year released a document outlining an enhanced strategic approach in dealing with Africa. It’s hard to imagine a clearer break with the posture taken by the administration of President Donald Trump, who famously dismissed African countries with a vulgarity.\n\nBiden is said to be planning to travel to Africa next year, according to Axios, a bold move that shows commitment to improving ties across the continent. This week, the White House also announced that it would be sending $55 billion in health, economic and security assistance to Africa – a down payment on future US investment in the continent.\n\nThe question is, how will the other global powers, including China and Russia, respond? It’s a good bet Biden discussed these ideas last week during the state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, who already has expressed his support for Africa’s full integration into the G20. And in a speech last month, he signaled his intent to “profoundly change” France’s sometimes tense relations with its African former colonies.\n\nEver the pragmatist, Macron simply did the math: Africa’s 1.4 billion people represent the fastest growing population on the planet. It’s also among the youngest, with 15.7 being the median age. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see Africa’s young population is poised to make their mark on the world economically and geopolitically.\n\nBut Biden has shrewdly assessed the situation as well. He’s betting that in serving as Africa’s advocate with the G20, African leaders will see the United State as the ally the continent has long wanted in its relationship with the US. And it could help him counter Russian and Chinese efforts to work against American interests in Africa.\n\nBiden could do even more to maximize the positive outcomes of the summit for Washington. He could propose a new strategic plan for American investment in Africa as bold as China’s “Belt and Road” infrastructure initiative. For that, he will need the support of American political and business leaders who will be closely watching events this week.\n\nThe summit’s fanfare and publicity will go a long way toward changing American attitudes about Africa. It will help American financial and business interests see the continent as much of the world sees it – a place of opportunity and not just of people in need.\n\nYes, Africa still has wars, natural disasters, and brutal dictators, like other continents. But it also has minerals and natural resources industries around the world need. It has a vibrant music and film industry that is impacting world culture and a growing population of consumers for American products.\n\nThe 2022 US-Africa summit is destined to make history, even if it only changes American attitudes about the continent and its people. The Economist says Africa is home to many of the world’s fastest growing economies, and its trade within the continent. Economists say its trade with the world has grown 300% in the last decade. It’s a market American business should claim now to make up for lost time.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPresident Macky Sall of Senegal, President of the African Union, has signaled that Africa would welcome closer ties with the US – but on different terms. Africans will no longer sit and patiently listen to what Americans want. They want to speak and be heard. President Biden and all Americans would do well to listen. Africa is a force American leaders can no longer afford to ignore while its global opponents use every opportunity to develop ties and reap the benefits.", "authors": ["Joyce M.

Some include a juice pouch and dessert, like gummy worms or Oreos.\n\nIn schools, however, the FDA allowed two Lunchables kits to be sold, according to Consumer Reports:\n\nTurkey & Cheddar Cracker Stackers\n\nExtra Cheesy Pizza meals\n\n“Last year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein,\" the company said. \"While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets.\"\n\nThe lunch kits made up less than 1% of Lunchables' sales, according to the company, and the \"business impact is negligible.”\n\nControversial school lunch\n\nThe decision to include these kits sparked controversy as those made specifically for schools contained higher levels of sodium compared to their grocery store counter parts, according to Consumer Reports, which \"applauds\" the news of its removal while calling on the USDA to adopt stricter requirements to be eligible for the program.\n\n“Lunchables and other lunch kits with concerning levels of sodium and harmful chemicals have no place on the school lunch menu,” Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. “We’re pleased that Heinz Kraft has pulled Lunchables from the school lunch program after lower than expected demand from school districts across the country.\"\n\nThe removal is also happening after Consumer Reports and More Perfect Union renewed its call to remove the product from schools, where it could also be purchased by low-income students receiving free and reduced-price meals through the school lunch program, and delivered a petition to the Department of Agriculture with almost 50,000 signatures in September, according to a press release published by Consumer Reports on Monday.\n\n\"The USDA should maintain stricter eligibility standards for the school lunch programs so that the millions of kids that depend on it get the healthier options they deserve,” said Ronholm.\n\nWhat is the National School Lunch Program?\n\nIt is a \"federally assisted meal program operating in public and nonprofit private schools and residential childcare institutions,\" according to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.\n\nThe program provides \"nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches\" to students while implementing other programs that \"promote healthy eating habits and physical activity at school.\"\n\nHowever, Consumer Reports believed the lunch kits do not meet those requirements.\n\nHigh levels of lead and sodium\n\nConsumer Reports warned the public about the high levels of lead and sodium found in Lunchables in April, when it published a study that tested 12 store-bought Lunchables products and compared them to similar lunch and snack kits from other manufacturers.\n\n“We don’t think anybody should regularly eat these products, and they definitely shouldn’t be considered a healthy school lunch,” Eric Boring, a chemist at Consumer Reports who lead the testing, previously said in a statement.\n\nAlthough none of the kits exceeded any legal or regulatory limit, the tests uncovered “relatively high levels of lead, cadmium and sodium” in the Lunchables kits, said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.\n\nHowever, Kraft Heinz said the Consumer Reports study is \"misleading.\"\n\n\"We are extremely disappointed with the reporting from Consumer Reports and believe the results of their study are misleading, causing undue concern over the safety of our products,\" Kraft Heinz previously told USA TODAY in a statement. \"The fact is that all Lunchables products meet strict safety standards set by government agencies. Consumer Reports admits that none of the food they tested exceeded any legal or regulatory limits, but they chose to bury that fact.\"\n\nIn Consumer Reports' reporting on metals, the results of the study are based on California's maximum allowable dose for heavy metals, the Chicago, Illinois-headquartered food company said.\n\nAll Kraft Heinz's products, including Lunchables, \"tested well below the acceptable limits,\" according to the company.\n\nWhat is cadmium?\n\nClassified as a human carcinogen, cadmium has been linked to kidney and bone disease, as well as cancer, according to the World Health Organization. However, because cadmium is a natural element present in the soil, it can't be altogether avoided.\n\nAs for lead, no safe level exists for children to consume, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.\n\nAll but one of the kits, Lunchables Extra Cheesy Pizza, contained harmful phthalates – dubbed “everywhere chemicals” for their prevalence in plastic that can be linked to reproductive issues, diabetes and some cancers.\n\nMeeting meal program's requirements\n\nWhile the USDA doesn't specifically allow or prohibit individual food items, the agency has requirements in place to \"address the overall content of meals,\" whether on a daily or weekly basis, the USDA previously told USA TODAY in a statement.\n\nMeaning, Lunchables would need to be paired with fruit, vegetables and milk, and schools would have to balance how often they serve high-sodium meals, the agency said.\n\n\"This is why we have a new proposed rule which aims to align our programs with the latest nutrition science and modernize our services to best serve kids,\" the statement read. \"Strengthening the nutrition of school meals comes from a common goal we all share: to help kids be healthy.\"\n\nTo meet the requirements of the federally assisted school meal program overseen by the USDA, Kraft Heinz added more whole grains to the crackers and more protein to the school Lunchable kits, Consumer Reports said.\n\nKraft Heinz previously told USA TODAY in a statement Wednesday the company has taken steps to make Lunchables more nutritious by, for instance, adding fresh fruits to certain kits and reducing the overall sodium by as much as 26%.\n\n\"Many of our Lunchables products are a good source of protein, offering nutrients through meats and cheeses,\" according to the statement. \"All our foods meet strict safety standards that we happily feed to our own families ... We are proud of Lunchables and stand by the quality and integrity that goes into making them.\n\nJulia Gomez is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

Lunchables have also in recent years become a menu item at many schools across the United States, thanks to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nBut Consumer Reports is hoping that changes.\n\nTurns out, the popular snack may not be the healthiest option for growing kids. Lunchables contain a troublingly high level of lead and sodium, the consumer watchdog group warned Tuesday in a new report.\n\n“We don’t think anybody should regularly eat these products, and they definitely shouldn’t be considered a healthy school lunch,” Eric Boring, a chemist at Consumer Reports who lead the testing, said in a statement.\n\nIs there lead in Lunchables?What to know after Consumer Reports released guidance to USDA\n\nConsumer Reports finds high levels of lead, sodium in Lunchables\n\nThe advocacy group said it tested 12 store-bought Lunchables products, made by Kraft Heinz and compared them to similar lunch and snack kits from other manufacturers.\n\nAlthough none of the kits exceeded any legal or regulatory limit, the tests uncovered “relatively high levels of lead, cadmium and sodium” in the Lunchables kits, said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.\n\nClassified as a human carcinogen, cadmium has been linked to kidney and bone disease, as well as cancer, according to the World Health Organization. However, because cadmium is a natural element present in the soil, it can't be altogether avoided.\n\nAs for lead, no safe level exists for children to consume, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.\n\n“There’s a lot to be concerned about in these kits,” Amy Keating, a registered dietitian at Consumer Reports, said in a statement. “They’re highly processed, and regularly eating processed meat, a main ingredient in many of these products, has been linked to increased risk of some cancers.”\n\nThe sodium levels in the store-bought kits ranged from 460 to 740 milligrams per serving, \"nearly a quarter to half of a child’s daily recommended limit for sodium,\" Consumer Reports' testing found.\n\nAll but one of the kits, Lunchables Extra Cheesy Pizza, contained harmful phthalates – dubbed “everywhere chemicals” for their prevalence in plastic that can be linked to reproductive issues, diabetes and some cancers.\n\nSchool lunch policies\n\nConsumer Reports also analyzed two Lunchables kits made specifically for schools that are eligible to be served to children under the National School Lunch Program.\n\nWhile the group didn’t test the school kits for heavy metals or phthalates, chemists did review nutritional information and ingredients lists in the two products – Turkey & Cheddar Cracker Stackers and Extra Cheesy Pizza – to find higher levels of sodium than store-bought versions.\n\nTo meet the requirements of the federally assisted school meal program overseen by the USDA, Kraft Heinz added more whole grains to the crackers and more protein to the school Lunchable kits, Consumer Reports said.\n\n“Lunchables are not a healthy option for kids and shouldn’t be allowed on the menu as part of the National School Lunch Program,” Ronholm said in a statement.\n\nKraft Heinz told USA TODAY in a statement Wednesday the company has taken steps to make Lunchables more nutritious by, for instance, adding fresh fruits to certain kits and reducing the overall sodium by as much as 26%.\n\n\"Many of our Lunchables products are a good source of protein, offering nutrients through meats and cheeses,\" according to the statement. \"All our foods meet strict safety standards that we happily feed to our own families ... We are proud of Lunchables and stand by the quality and integrity that goes into making them.\n\nCR petitions USDA to remove Lunchables from school lunch menus\n\nAs a result of its findings, the non-profit consumer group said it has petitioned the USDA to remove Lunchables from school cafeterias.\n\nThe petition had more than 14,100 signatures as of Wednesday morning.\n\nA USDA spokesperson said in a Wednesday statement to USA TODAY that the agency \"takes very seriously our responsibility to ensure school meals are of the highest nutritional quality.”\n\nWhile the USDA doesn't specifically allow or prohibit individual food items, the agency has requirements in place to \"address the overall content of meals,\" whether on a daily or weekly basis, the statement read. That means, Lunchables would need to be paired with fruit, vegetables and milk, and schools would have to balance how often they serve high-sodium meals, the agency said.\n\n\"This is why we have a new proposed rule which aims to align our programs with the latest nutrition science and modernize our services to best serve kids,\" the statement read. \"Strengthening the nutrition of school meals comes from a common goal we all share: to help kids be healthy.\"\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

What to know amid E. coli outbreak", "text": "AI-assisted summary McDonald's has pulled the Quarter Pounder from some restaurants due to an E. coli outbreak linked to the sandwich.\n\nThe outbreak has affected 49 people across 10 states, with one fatality reported in Colorado.\n\nWhile the investigation is ongoing, onions are suspected as the source of the E. coli contamination.\n\nMcDonald's maintains that its other menu items are safe to eat and that the company is cooperating with authorities.\n\nFood safety experts advise consumers to be aware of the risks and make informed decisions about their food choices.\n\nMcDonald's has pulled the Quarter Pounder from about one-fifth of its restaurants over concerns linking the sandwich to an E. coli outbreak, which has killed one and sickened at least 49.\n\nBut the fast food giant says consumers should feel safe eating at its restaurants across the U.S., and in parts of the U.S. where the Quarter Pounder has been removed from the menu.\n\nThe beef patty and slivered onions put on the patty have been removed from those restaurants in regions where people have reported getting sick and eating a Quarter Pounder, the company said in a briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said onions may be the source of the outbreak. The onions used on the Quarter Pounder come from a single supplier in the affected regions, company spokespeople said during the briefing.\n\nMcDonald’s has been working with safety regulators since late last week about the potential outbreak when there were fewer known cases, the company said.\n\nWhere the Quarter Pounder off the menu:McDonald's locations in 12 states impacted amid E. coli outbreak\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the FDA announced Tuesday an investigation into Quarter Pounders, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), into the outbreak.\n\nBeef patties used in making Quarter Pounders in the affected areas come from multiple suppliers, so that makes it a less likely culprit, McDonald's said. And the FSIS has not yet finished its investigation into beef used, so there's no finality, the company said. So to protect consumers, McDonald's has pulled the Quarter Pounder and is also doing its own investigation into the beef and onions used.\n\n\"Given the recent events of the past 24 hours, our priority is to reinforce the confidence of American consumers,\" McDonald's USA President Joe Erlinger said Wednesday on NBC's \"Today\" show.\n\n\"Investigators from all agencies are working quickly to determine the contaminated ingredient,\" the CDC said Tuesday.\n\nSo for now, the regulatory agencies have preliminarily narrowed the source of the outbreak to either beef patties or slivered onions \"and FDA believes that it is the onions,\" said Janet Buffer, senior institute manager for the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security with The George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health.\n\nBut what about someone who has a hankering for a McDonald's burger and fries in states where there's no Quarter Pounder on the menu? Is it really safe? Well, that depends on your capacity for risk, experts say.\n\nIs it safe to eat at McDonald's?\n\nOK, if you are eating a burger right now, put it down, chew and swallow before reading the next sentence.\n\nSince onions are served fresh, they can become adulterated with E. Coli through fecal contamination, which can occur through wastewater, water in the growing area, fertilizer and the proximity of the growing area to livestock, food safety lawyer Bill Marler and food scientist and food industry consultant Bryan Quoc Le told USA TODAY.\n\nMcDonald's said suppliers clean, slice and again clean onions before they are bagged and refrigerated. Different diced onions are used on regular burgers.\n\nBecause the onions are not fully heated before consumption, they can carry that contamination on to the consumer, they said.\n\nThere have been significant outbreaks linked to onions and salmonella in the past, Marler said, and the process of onions getting contaminated with salmonella is no different than onions getting contaminated with E. coli.\n\nMcDonald's has stringent cooking standards and tests the heat of the Quarter Pounder patties, the company said. That makes onions the likely culprit, Marler said. \"It would be unusual to have undercooking happen in 10 different states, so it's probably a good bet it is the onion supplier, but there's still risk of cross contamination within the restaurants,\" he said.\n\nAs for eating at the restaurants, he said.\"I think it's a little too early to say McDonald's is safe to eat at,\" Marler said.\n\nHowever, McDonald's could increase its safety measures by shutting down the locations where E. coli illnesses happened \"to thoroughly clean them,\" because possibly contaminated products did pass through kitchen facilities, Marler said. The potential for cross-contamination could be in sinks, on cutting boards and other food prep surfaces, he said.\n\n\"I'm not suggesting all McDonald's are unsafe to eat at,\" Marler said. However, \"I think at least the restaurants where there are confirmed illnesses linked to it should be shut down for a period of time for a thorough cleaning just in case.\"\n\nQuoc Le is more likely to say McDonald's remains a \"pretty safe bet,\" for fast-food fans. Beyond the Quarter Pounder, \"there shouldn't be any concern in terms of eating them,\" he said. \"McDonald's is fairly good about their logistics and distribution and so they're able to recall a lot of their products fairly quickly.\"\n\nBut, he added, \"I mean, for now, probably the next couple of days, you can avoid the Quarter Pounder, but the rest of the items I don't see there being an issue.\"\n\nConsumers should know \"there is always a level of uncertainty when consuming food, and every individual must determine their level of risk tolerance,\" Buffer said.\n\nWhich states are impacted\n\nThese are the states where 49 persons are known to have gotten sick from E. coli infections between Sept. 27 and Oct. 11, the CDC says. One person in Colorado died and 10 people have been hospitalized:\n\nColorado (26 cases)\n\nIowa (1)\n\nKansas (1)\n\nMissouri (1)\n\nMontana (1)\n\nNebraska (9)\n\nOregon (1)\n\nUtah (4)\n\nWisconsin (1)\n\nWyoming (4)\n\nMcDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder off the menu in Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Wyoming, as well as parts of Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.\n\nWhat is E. coli and what are the symptoms\n\nE. coli, or Escherichia coli, is a type of bacteria that resides harmlessly in the intestines of people and animals. But some E. coli can cause mild to life-threatening gastrointestinal illnesses if consumed, the CDC says.\n\nThe types of E. coli that may cause diarrhea usually spread through food or water contaminated with feces contact with animals or people. Animals such as cattle may also spread E. coli to food and food crops. And food handlers can spread infection when they do not use proper hand washing hygiene after using the restroom.\n\nE. coli infections can cause severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting for around five to seven days; infections typically occur three to four days after consuming the germ, according to the CDC.\n\nThis story has been updated to include new information.\n\nContributing: Max Hauptman and James Powel, USA TODAY, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

All Kraft Heinz's products, including Lunchables, \"tested well below the acceptable limits,\" according to the company.\n\n\"The metals they focus on are naturally occurring, and thus low levels may be present in any food product,\" Kraft Heinz said. \"We do not add these elements to our products.\"\n\n'Lunchables adhere to all USDA standards', Kraft Heinz says\n\nKraft Heinz maintains that the \"National School Lunch Program-approved Lunchables adhere to all USDA standards,\" according to the statement.\n\n\"We increased the amount of meat in the products to increase protein levels and help fuel kids throughout the day,\" the food company said. \"With more meat comes naturally elevated levels of sodium to ensure safe preservation of the product. It’s worth reiterating that Consumer Reports did not test our school products.\"\n\nKraft Heinz said it is proud of the product.\n\n\"By offering Lunchables in schools, we’re able to help meet schools’ needs by giving them affordable, convenient solutions that provide students with quality nutrition at lunchtime,\" the company said. \"We’ve received feedback that products like Lunchables are more trusted by school administrators due to our strict food safety and quality guarantee. We see our work with schools as a solution to valid struggles schools may face.\"\n\nAre Lunchables being recalled?\n\nLunchables have not been recalled. Consumer Reports is suggesting to the USDA that the snack kits be removed from the National School Lunch Program.\n\nKraft Heinz would have to voluntarily initiate a recall of Lunchables, according to the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn some situations, the FDA can request or mandate a recall, but the federal agency has not done so for Lunchables. If it did, any violation could be corrected and Lunchables would return to the marketplace, according to the FDA's website.\n\nLunchables also do not appear on the FDA's enforcement reports for April.\n\nAre Lunchables healthy?\n\nMaya Feller, a registered dietitian and nutritionist who worked with New York City Public Schools, said she's concerned about the \"regular inclusion of Lunchables and Lunchable-type kits\" because they're not \"nutrient-dense options\" for students, according to an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"The high sodium content is definitely of concern, especially from a young age,\" Feller said. \"The health risks associated with high and chronic consumption of added salts are well documented.\"\n\nFrom Feller's clinical experience, she would like to see more \"nutrient-dense plant-forward options\" in schools, especially meals with less added sugars, saturated fats and added salts, ABC News reported.\n\nThough many may be skeptical of picking up a Lunchable, the FDA says, it is \"not possible to completely prevent lead from entering the food supply.\"\n\nAlthough it's impossible to prevent lead in food, it is food manufacturers' legal responsibility to \"significantly minimize or prevent chemical hazards when needed,\" according to the FDA.\n\nWhen did Lunchables come out?\n\nLunchables were introduced in 1988 as simple packages of meat, cheese and crackers, according to a Washington Post article in 1999.\n\nOver time, other variations of Lunchables have been released, including Pizza Swirls and Pizza Dunks, hot dogs, hamburgers, tacos and nachos, The Post reported.\n\nWho owns Lunchables? When were they invented?\n\nKraft Heinz, a food company formed in 2015 through the merger of Kraft Foods Group and H.J. Heinz Holding Corp., owns Lunchables.\n\nLunchables are marked under Oscar Mayer, the original creator of the snack kits in 1985, according to journalist Michael Moss's 2013 book titled \"Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us.\"\n\nHow much are Lunchables?\n\nLunchables vary in price depending on where they're bought, but most single kits cost less than $2.\n\nWalmart is selling most of its single Lunchables kits for $1.87, according to the store's website.\n\nTarget is selling its Lunchables single kits for $1.99, according to the retailer's website.\n\nLunchables kits with their \"100 percent juice\" can be a little pricier, but are still around $3 at most stores.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/04/05/school-lunch-nutrition-new-standards/2053851/", "title": "Schools hungry to improve taste, nutrition of lunches", "text": "Christopher Doering, Gannett Washington Bureau\n\nSchool districts trying to adjust to new guidelines requiring healthier food in lunchrooms\n\nUSDA%2C local officials rely on feedback from students%2C staff on new menu options\n\nLack of interest fells some items from school menus%2C including sloppy joes\n\nNOKESVILLE, Va. -- When diners at an exclusive food tasting recently noshed on sesame green beans and flame-roasted redskin potatoes, they weren't celebrating at the area's newest culinary hot spot.\n\nInstead, these gourmands were huddled in a high school cafeteria sampling nearly 40 delicacies that could soon become permanent items for thousands of children who eat lunch and breakfast in this Northern Virginia school district each day.\n\nThe annual tasting show, a popular event for Prince William County officials to showcase new foods and collect input from students, parents and school staff, has taken on added significance following new U.S. Agriculture Department nutrition standards approved last year. School districts must now limit the calories that students consume, phase in whole grains, gradually lower sodium levels, and offer at least one fruit or vegetable per meal, among other requirements.\n\nSchools are working to comply with these new measures by adding more green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli, and overhauling traditional mainstays like pizza by substituting in low fat cheese and wholegrain crust, all within a limited budget. But officials are aware their efforts to improve nutrition will ultimately fail if their finicky customers at more than 100,000 institutions nationwide refuse to eat the new offerings.\n\nFor each food item, we look and say \"can we afford this, is it good for them, does it meet all the new food requirements, those kind of things, but what's really important is are they going to buy it if we put it out there,\" said Serena Suthers, director of school food and nutrition services in Prince William County, located southwest of Washington, D.C.\n\nThe challenge is to win over students such as 8th-grader Terrell Worrell who only buys school lunch once a week. Worrell, one of the students attending the tasting, said he was surprised to find that he liked many of the foods he tried, especially the buffalo chicken and sweet potato swirl. In the past, Worrell and his friends have thought that as the meals have gotten healthier, the taste has failed to keep up.\n\n\"These examples that they're thinking of putting in the school lunches, they seem like they're trying to make them better because they've noticed that us kids don't really like what they've been putting out so far,\" said Worrell. The 13-year-old said he would be open to buying lunch more often if some of the items he enjoyed during the tasting were on the menu when he starts high school later this year. \"It depends on how this turns out,\" he said.\n\nSchool meal programs feed nearly 32 million children each day, according to the USDA. In Iowa, nearly 400,000 students eat lunch at school every day -- about 73% of all kids enrolled in participating state schools. An estimated 93,000 Iowa kids also eat breakfast at school.\n\nThe new nutrition guidelines were put in place at the beginning of the 2012-13 school year, starting with changes to the lunch program, to address the childhood obesity epidemic. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 17% of children and adolescents are considered obese. Since 1980, the obesity rate for this group has tripled.\n\nThe new standards require lunches each week to average from 550 to 650 calories for kids in elementary school, 600 to 700 calories for those in middle school and 750 to 850 calories for high school students. An example of a typical elementary school lunch before the new standards had cheese pizza, canned pineapple, tater tots and low fat chocolate milk. Today it would be replaced by whole wheat cheese pizza, baked sweet potato fries, grape tomatoes, applesauce and low fat milk.\n\nThe new school lunch regulations have been widely criticized by students, parents, lawmakers and administrators for being too costly and not providing enough flexibility. Opponents have argued the lunches are too small and lack enough calories for active children, especially high school students who are involved in sports and other activities.\n\n\"You could have a 70-pound freshman in high school on the same diet as a 250-pound high school football player and obviously both of them would need a different level of calories,\" said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a vocal critic of the new guidelines. \"The school lunch program was established in order to ensure that kids had a nutritious diet so they could learn and now (USDA is) using it to put them on a diet. I think they have overreached on this substantially.\"\n\nKing said limiting the number of calories students consume could backfire by leaving kids hungry and more likely to consume weight-inducing junk food when they leave school.\n\nAcross the country, the foods offered to students during breakfast and lunch vary by school district. Each year, about 15% to 20% of the funding for the programs is used by the states and school districts to purchase items -- ranging from unsweetened applesauce and low sodium canned beans to lean ground beef and turkey roasts -- from a list of more than 180 items offered by the USDA. The remaining 80% to 85% goes to states and schools, giving them the flexibility to buy the items they need, such as a particular food popular in their region.\n\nSchool districts are left to decide their own breakfast and lunch menus, as long as they comply with federal nutrition guidelines. To come up with a list of new recipes isn't easy, and ideas are regularly mined from both traditional and unusual places.\n\nSuthers said the school district holds a recipe contest among the staff to come up with suggestions. Some food items are taken directly from restaurant menus and adapted for use in the school. But it's the input from students during the school day and at tastings like this one that have the most impact on shaping the course of foods that make their way into the cafeteria.\n\n\"(Children) just love the idea of having some say,\" said Suthers. \"So many things in kids' lives, they don't get to have much say in, so they love this event where they get to come and give opinions to adults.\"\n\nThose attending the tasting at the Prince William County high school were given a one-page form to evaluate whether or not they liked the food items they tried and provide any comments. During the two-hour event, students, parents and school staff were able to visit as many of the eight food stations as they wanted before sitting down at round tables in the cafeteria to eat. USDA officials, who were in attendance, regularly go to tasting events around the country put on by schools. They also visit cafeterias during the day to talk with kids and staff about the food and identify growing trends.\n\nIncreasingly, the foods offered by the USDA and put on the menu by schools are being shaped by what children eat and see at home. Government officials in charge of ordering and buying food for the school lunch program said as the popularity grows of Thai cuisine, intense flavors like buffalo wings and vegetarian options, kids have started asking for the items to be served in their cafeterias, too.\n\nIn addition, as parents instill a healthier lifestyle at home, kids are expecting similar characteristics in the food they eat away from the dinner table.\n\n\"Schoolchildren are becoming very sophisticated eaters,\" said Laura Walter, a USDA official in charge of reviewing the foods offered to schools through the department's Food and Nutrition Service. Walter said sometimes they get inundated with requests from school districts for certain products. The most recent delectable surprise: frozen broccoli. \"Word of mouth is spreading through the grapevine. We want this,\" she said.\n\nItems do get dropped by USDA if they get too expensive to purchase or not enough schools demand them. Batter-breaded chicken and sloppy joes are some of the most recent casualties. In their place, new items are added to the menu. Later this year, USDA is considering letting schools purchase string cheese in a single serve pack, frozen spinach and fruit cups for grab and go lunches and breakfasts.\n\nCasey Tran, a high school senior, said at the recent tasting the food he sampled was fresher and there were more flavors than he's used to.\n\n\"It's pretty good compared to the stuff we have currently. I wouldn't throw it away,\" said Tran, a 17-year-old who buys lunch every day. \"I'll eat it but it can't compare to home cooking.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/lifestyle/2018/01/30/the-disappearance-johnny-marzetti/15375172007/", "title": "The disappearance of Johnny Marzetti", "text": "Eric Lyttle\n\nColumbus Monthly\n\nI grew up with Johnny Marzetti. I guess I assumed everybody did. I've since learned I was wrong. I learn that a lot the older I get.\n\nWho's Johnny Marzetti, you ask? It's not a “who,” it's a “what.” And if you have to ask, you're probably not from around here, are you? Simply put, Johnny Marzetti is a baked casserole of noodles, ground beef, tomatoes and cheese. My mom made it the best, of course, all creamy and steamy and filling and good. But I also had Johnny Marzetti scooped onto my pastel-green sectioned school lunch tray on a weekly basis growing up in Westerville in the 1970s. If that wasn't enough, there was Johnny Marzetti at the sports banquets, neighborhood potlucks, family reunions. I ate a lot of Johnny Marzetti.\n\nBut after the Wall Street Journal, of all sources, devoted a page in a weekend edition to Johnny Marzetti last May, I realized I hadn't thought of the dish in years, much less eaten it. The Journal story was headlined “Hello, Columbus,” and was the latest installment in its “United Plates Field Guide to Regional Dishes” series, dubbing the comfort-food casserole of my youth as the signature dish of Ohio. I raved: “Johnny Marzetti! I used to love that stuff.” I was surprised when I caught odd looks from a few coworkers. “Johnny Marzetti?” a few asked. They'd never heard of Johnny.\n\nMy curiosity was piqued. What had happened to Johnny Marzetti? I wanted to know more. What I discovered was more interesting than I'd ever imagined. The dish I'd grown up with had a history that was almost certainly built on a complete fabrication. And Michelle Obama, of all people, might have contributed to its demise.\n\nI first turned to my old stomping grounds in Westerville to begin my journey into the heart of Johnny Marzetti. I figured I'd start by visiting one of my old schools on Johnny Marzetti day, eat with some students, talk to some lunch ladies. I Googled the Westerville schools lunch menu. No Johnny Marzetti. I searched the lunch menus of some other area districts: Grandview and Gahanna, Worthington and Whitehall, Grove City and Groveport. I called the number for food services at the Columbus City Schools. The woman who answered laughed. She knew Johnny Marzetti, all right, but said the schools hadn't served it for years.\n\nI was stunned. I broadened my search, Googling “school lunch menu Johnny Marzetti.” To my relief, a few schools popped up. The West Branch district, near Alliance, served Johnny Marzetti to elementary and middle school students on a recent Tuesday, with corn, a mixed green salad, fried apples and milk. Miller High School and Millcreek Elementary in the Southern Local district near New Straitsville served Johnny Marzetti, steamed peas, fruit cocktail and fat-free milk on a Wednesday. The closest public school district to Columbus that I could find with Johnny Marzetti on the menu was Lakewood Local Schools in Hebron, near Buckeye Lake.\n\nI called Jennifer Stover, the district's food services director. Stover has been serving school lunches for 19 years. “What happened?” I asked. “When did schools stop serving Johnny Marzetti?”\n\nThat's when I learned about Michelle Obama's role. Stover didn't pin it on the former First Lady specifically. She said it was the law that reformed school lunches in 2010. But after doing a bit of reading, I came to a conclusion: Michelle Obama was an accessory to Marzetti's disappearance. When Barack Obama first took office, Michelle endeavored to use her newfound position and influence to battle childhood obesity. It was a noble cause, and her passion became the inspiration for the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010. That law reimbursed districts that served meals with more green vegetables, fruits and whole grains—none of which finds its way into even the most creative Johnny Marzetti recipe.\n\n“We get an extra 6 cents for meals that meet the standards, and we send in our menus to be certified,” Stover says. “They need to have a bean or legume, an orange or red vegetable, a starch, a dark green vegetable and whole grains, even in the pizza crust. It's kind of funny when I talk about it, but it's not funny in the lunchrooms because the kids don't eat that stuff. They don't like it.”\n\nStover, however, still serves Johnny Marzetti. “I still make it with egg noodles,” she says. “I'll probably get in trouble for saying that, but the kids really like it. And if they eat it, I know they're getting a good, home-cooked meal.”\n\nOn a weekday in December, Stover invited me out to Lakewood High School to share Johnny Marzetti with the students. She said she'd been carrying the same recipe for 19 years, from lunch-service jobs with Coshocton, Midview and now Lakewood. Her recipe feeds about 600 and calls for 72 pounds of ground beef, three cups of minced onion, 16 50-ounce cans of tomato soup, four No. 10 cans of crushed tomatoes and eight No. 10 cans of tomato sauce, four cups of sugar, 10 pounds of shredded American cheese, 10 pounds of shredded mozzarella cheese and 30 pounds of egg noodles, with 10 additional pounds of both cheeses for the topping. The whole thing is then baked at 325 for 30 minutes.\n\nHead cook Marsha Parlet whipped up the day's batch and spooned out a bowl for me. It was the first Marzetti I'd eaten in at least 20 years, and by the second fork full, I think I caught myself purring. “Do you like it?” Parlet asked. The pace of my shoveling was all the answer she needed. “I like it, too,” she said. “I don't serve the kids anything I don't like.”\n\nParlet says it's equally popular with the students. “When we serve Marzetti, most of the kids take it. They like the homemade food. In this busy world, no one has the time to cook like they used to. They love my macaroni and cheese, and they love my Marzetti.”\n\nBryce Nichols, 17, from Hebron, said he has study hall second period and can smell when it's Marzetti day. “It's so good,” he said. A pair of 15-year-old sophomores, Madison Linn and Bella Findlay, both said they like it when Marzetti is on the menu. “The sauce, the noodles, the meat—it's good,” Findlay said. The girls were surprised when I told them Lakewood was one of the last districts in Central Ohio that still serves Johnny Marzetti. “That's cool,” Findlay said, standing up to head to her next class. I suddenly felt bad for the kids in Westerville. Maybe their lunches were healthier, but I doubt they tasted any better.\n\nNow I wanted to look a little deeper into how Johnny Marzetti came to be. The Wall Street Journal indicated that it had Columbus roots. I guess I'd never given it much consideration. I suppose I thought Johnny Marzetti was some quick, easy thing soldiers whipped up over a campfire. The name had always conjured images of the Civil War in my head—you know, “Johnny Reb” and “When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah.” That kind of thing. I was probably learning about the Civil War one period and eating Johnny Marzetti the next. Who knows?\n\nBut Google “Johnny Marzetti” and you'll get hundreds, maybe thousands, of recipes and blog posts of fond remembrances from baby boomers like me about the Johnny Marzetti of their youth. Many repeat the same tale about how Johnny Marzetti originated in the kitchen of Marzetti's Restaurant—which first opened across from Ohio State University in 1896, the year Teresa Piancentini Marzetti emigrated from Italy to the United States— and closed its final Downtown location at 16 E. Broad Street in 1972, the year Teresa Marzetti died at the age of 93. The story is cited on such purportedly authoritative sources as the Ohio History Connection's website. It makes good, logical sense. But it's probably not true.\n\n“I think there's a lot of folklore behind that connection between the Marzetti restaurants and the dish Johnny Marzetti,” says Stefanie Coffman, senior consumer services manager for the T. Marzetti Co., which spun off from Marzetti's restaurants in 1950 to begin producing and distributing their popular salad dressings and dips, which are still distributed across the U.S. today. “Based on the records we have internally, there doesn't seem to be any connection. It was never on the menu in the restaurants, and we don't have any documentation that would connect Johnny Marzetti, the dish, to the T. Marzetti Co.”\n\n“It was just all made up,” says Rob Felty, the director of business development and the unofficial historian of the T. Marzetti Co., after he produced an in-house documentary on the company's heritage. “I think a lot of people have made a lot of assumptions for a lot years, and it just keeps getting repeated.” Felty wishes the connection was real. “It would be a fun story for the company.”\n\nSo it's not a Columbus dish after all? Well, not so fast. Murky origins or not, there can be no denying that Johnny Marzetti's roots grow deep here. A search of the Columbus Dispatch archives unveiled early records of a John Marzetti. On July 21, 1871—just 20 days after the Dispatch's first edition—an item appeared that said, “This morning John Marzetti, confectioner, fruiter and general dealer in all the luxuries of the season received from Loganport, Indiana, a carload of watermelons which are described to be the best stock ever brought here so early in the season. Those fond of melons will find good ones at Marzetti's at very reasonable prices.”\n\nOver the next 25 years, Marzetti would build a small business empire, selling everything from fruits and liquors to cigars and oysters from a stand, first at 31 N. High St. and later a block north at Gay and High streets. It also appears he opened several small restaurants. Three short items in the Dispatch edition from Sept. 17, 1875, state, “John Marzetti has the finest dining parlors in the city.” “Go to John Marzetti's and get a square meal.” And finally: “A regular dinner every day at John Marzetti's.”\n\nBefore he died, on Christmas Day in 1899, Marzetti had become one of the city's leading citizens, with numerous real estate holdings, including the entire northwest corner of High and Gay. He also provided the lion's share of the funds needed to build St. John the Baptist Catholic Church at the corner of Lincoln and Hamlet streets. It still serves as the center for the city's Italian community and home to Columbus's Italian Festival.\n\nBy 1918, quarter-page display ads for Marzetti's Restaurant—the one founded by Teresa and her husband, Joseph Marzetti, at 1548 N. High Street—began appearing in the Dispatch. The two Marzetti families were not directly related, however, and through more than a century of the two families' prosperous business ventures in the city, at no time was the dish Johnny Marzetti ever mentioned in stories or ads by either family. That connection between the dish and the restaurant began, it seems, only after Teresa Marzetti's 1972 death.\n\nThat doesn't mean the dish Johnny Marzetti was a Johnny-come-lately. A recipe for a dish named “John Marzetti” appeared in the Dispatch on April 11, 1916. It was the first reference I could find to any dish resembling what I grew up with. The 1916 version, however, was noticeably different, calling for a pound of “fresh pork” instead of ground beef, and spicy, calling for not only a teaspoon of chili powder, but one to four teaspoons of cayenne pepper, along with an onion, a pound of cream cheese and egg noodles.\n\nAfter that, however, no other mention of Johnny Marzetti appeared in the Dispatch until 1953, in a feature on casseroles under the headline, “Chores Disappear: Casserole Prepared With Minimum Work.” It marked the beginning of a casserole boom in America, as magazines catering to housewives began pouring out recipes for the fix-it-and-forget-it baked dinners. The 1953 recipe in the Dispatch was christened “John Marzetti” and called for both ground beef and ground pork, as well as green peppers, onions, Campbell's tomato soup and spaghetti. Three years later, in 1956, then-Dispatch food editor Barbara Myers published a recipe for “Johnny Marzetti” that eliminated the pork and added mushrooms. “Casserole cookery is the easiest we know—with Johnny Marzetti at the top of the list,” she wrote. “It's everybody's favorite.”\n\nBy 1963, a new food editor, Mary Pegg, had taken over at the Dispatch, and in an Aug. 11 column, she tried to set the record straight. “Fashions prevail in foods as well as in clothes,” she wrote. “These last few years, casserole dishes have had their day in the sun and like many another overdone idea this one-dish meal, with amazing combinations therein, did reach a saturation point.”\n\n“None the less, there are wonderful casserole combinations that had been around for a long, long time, and they are here to stay. One of the favorites is ground beef, noodles, vegetables and cheese. There are many variations on this recipe theme, but in our part of the country, the name ‘Johnny Marzetti' identifies the two basic ingredients—ground beef and noodles. Many Ohio families have a treasured recipe for this dish that has served two or three generations of potluck dinners, so the ‘original' recipe is for most of us the one we grew up with.”\n\n“The Marzetti family name is well known in the Columbus area,” Pegg wrote, “but ‘Johnny Marzetti' is not from the immediate family.” Apparently no one listened.\n\nPegg didn't offer up an explanation for the casserole's namesake, and now I understand why. I searched high and low, through hundreds of accounts, and I couldn't find a solid explanation, either. Not knowing, however, didn't diminish its popularity. In the years that followed, Johnny Marzetti recipes proliferated, the variations among its four basic ingredients of meat, tomatoes, noodles and cheese limited only by imagination. Elbow macaroni? Egg noodles? Spaghetti? Whatever your preference.\n\nGround beef? Ground sausage? Both? Why not?\n\nTomatoes? Tomato paste? Tomato soup? All acceptable.\n\nAnd cheeses? It's usually sharp cheddar that makes for gooey goodness. But parmesan? A little mozzarella? It's your Johnny Marzetti. No one's going to say you're wrong.\n\nBeyond that, recipes included mushrooms, onions, green peppers, olives. Some added a dash of sugar. There are even variations on the name of the dish. Generally speaking, if you're from Wisconsin or Minnesota or the like, you might know it as goulash. If you're from northern New England, you likely remember it as American Chop Suey, and your Massachusetts grandmother's recipe probably says “brown the hamburg” instead of “brown the hamburger.” Some even call it slumgullion, though I have no idea where that word originates and I'm pretty sure I'd have never touched anything named slumgullion.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Johnny Marzetti was being advertised in the Big Bear grocery store fliers at 79 cents a pound at the deli counter, and it was being served at the Downtown Lazarus diners, including the Highlander Grill in the west basement and the Copper Kettle in the Downtown annex.\n\nIt still survives in certain corners of Columbus. Plank's Café & Pizzeria on Parsons Avenue has been serving Johnny Marzetti as long as anyone can remember, and the memories are long there. The restaurant is owned by John Plank, the grandson of the founder, Walter Plank Jr., who opened his restaurant in 1939. Kelly Black has been the cook at Plank's for 32 years, and her time at the grill overlapped Nellie Moore, a Plank's cook for 46 years. Black says she uses Nellie's recipe. “We don't like to change the recipes at Plank's,” Black says. “We have a loyal clientele. They like things the way they are. I don't even let the salesmen change the brands of the ingredients we use. You change the brands, you change the taste.”\n\nBlack recites the ingredients in her Johnny Marzetti. When I ask about proportions, she answers, “Oh, honey, I don't measure anything. I never have. Nellie never did, either.”\n\nShe confessed, however, that “personally, I don't like it. I don't like cooked tomatoes. But they love it here. When we make it, we always sell out.”\n\nThere's even a new Johnny Marzetti in town. Middle West Spirits' new Service Bar restaurant at 1230 Courtland Ave., which opened to rave reviews in October, features a dish named Michelone Marzetti. It's the creation of chef Avishar Barua. The 2005 Columbus Academy graduate says he grew up with Johnny Marzetti. School lunch “was the only thing I really looked forward to,” he says. “My parents are from Bangladesh, and the school lunches were filled with things I didn't get to have at home.”\n\nHis modernized Marzetti combines the past and the present with a nod to co-owner Ryan Lang, whose mother's maiden name is Michelone. Lang's grandmother, Barua says, is a fantastic cook of Abruzzi heritage, with a stockpile of secret recipes. The dish includes homemade noodles, a “Sunday sauce” derived from Lang's family cookbook and Locatelli Pecorino Romano cheese—“his mom insisted that if we didn't use that cheese, we'd be in trouble,” says Barua. Instead of ground beef, the Michelone Marzetti is served with a large meatball, which Barua says should be smashed into the pasta and sauce.\n\nBarua isn't concerned that serving a gourmet version of Johnny Marzetti is akin to making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. He embraces the notion. “People are trying to steer away from the food they grew up with when, in fact, they should be proud of it. What's wrong with that? I think a lot of people are looking at the wrong places for heritage. It's already here. And it's OK to like it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/09/14/cinnamon-product-lead-fda/75226548007/", "title": "Lead in cinnamon? Other items also have lead concerns.", "text": "Several companies this week said they’d stop selling cinnamon products after Consumer Reports found items tainted with lead.\n\nThe consumer nonprofit found traces of lead in cinnamon powder and multi-spice powders from a dozen brands. Consumer Reports used a threshold of 1 part per million that New York state uses to recall products. Food safety experts from the nonprofit advised people to \"avoid those products.\"\n\nThe companies include Paras, EGN, Mimi's Products, Bowl & Basket, Rani Brand, Zara Foods, Three Rivers, Yu Yee Brand, BaiLiFeng, Spicy King, Badia and Deep. It’s unclear how the products ended up with elevated lead levels.\n\nHowever, the powders aren’t the only items that have been found to contain lead, a neurotoxin that can be harmful at any level. Regulation on lead in food and other everyday products is an increasing concern, especially as traditional sources of lead exposure from paint, gasoline and pipes have declined considerably.\n\nHow does lead end up in food?\n\nLead occurs naturally, though how it ends up in the food supply is complicated. In a globalized economy, the U.S. often imports foods, particularly spices. Those items can be sourced from countries where there’s less regulation. Lead has been used to make food products look more appealing, but nearby industrial activity can also taint water and soil used on crops.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration didn't respond to an email request for comment on the Consumer Reports findings.\n\nOther food products with recent lead concerns\n\nIn March, the FDA said that testing on six ground cinnamon products found they had elevated levels of lead.\n\nIn April, a separate Consumer Reports report recommended Lunchables be removed from the National School Lunch Program because of higher levels of sodium and lead, though the product’s maker called it misleading and said their products met regulations.\n\nIn November, WanaBana recalled cinnamon applesauce products. The company sourced cinnamon manufactured in Ecuador that was tainted with lead chromate, an additive that seeks to brighten the spice. There were at least 500 cases across the U.S. of children who ate the snack and had elevated lead levels.\n\nWhy is lead dangerous?\n\nLead is especially concerning because children’s bodies absorb it more easily than adults, whether they breathe it in, ingest it or touch it. Children who have iron deficiencies, a condition more common in premature babies or those with low birth weight, take in lead even more.\n\nHigh levels of lead can cause seizures, coma and death. But even at low levels, it can cause behavioral problems, loss of IQ and attention deficit disorders. Children can also have stunted growth and impaired hearing or speech.\n\nRegulation around lead restrictions, such as pipes, paint and gasoline, has contributed to precipitous declines in lead exposure in children in the U.S. Additionally, Medicaid covers the cost of blood tests to detect lead in children, and many private insurers do the same. In 1988, more than a quarter of children 5 and younger had elevated lead levels in their blood. In 2014, that number was 2%.\n\nCertain communities are still at greater risk of lead exposure. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says this includes children of color, immigrants and refugees, families in poverty, and people in older housing. But the changing face of exposure — to food or other household items — reaffirms that everyone is at risk.\n\nJonathan Limehouse of USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/29/alaskan-salmon-mahi-mahi-districts-new-menu-wins-applause/594727001/", "title": "District's new menu items win applause, no 'Ewwww(s)'!", "text": "Joe Urban was a little anxious.\n\nThe director of nutrition services for Greenville County Schools was facing some demanding food critics: a table of hungry sixth-graders.\n\nWould the students like the new items on the cafeteria menu?\n\nUrban need not have worried.

We're using only wholesome products.\"\n\nAmong the new selections at the district's 100 or so school cafeterias:\n\n• Alaskan salmon.\n\n• Alaskan pollock.\n\n• Mahi-mahi and cheese grits.\n\n• Korean BBQ and mahi-mahi grain bowls.\n\n• Local Brasstown Beef in meatloaf, tacos and shepherd’s pie.\n\n• Chicken Wing Bar with four to six flavors of wings.\n\n• New salads such as buffalo blue chicken, cobb, crispy chicken, tuna and salmon caesar.\n\n• Italian sausage subs.\n\n• Unlimited vegetables for all students.\n\nNew additions coming soon include:\n\n• Chicken and Waffle Bar.\n\n• Brasstown Beef Philly cheesesteak.\n\n• Soup and sandwich bar.\n\n• Build Your Own Burger Bar.\n\nAll of the new items, of course, are not available every day: Some will be offered once a week or even once every three weeks.\n\nLikewise, middle and high school menus include more choices than the one at the elementary schools.\n\nOld standbys are not going away either: At Tanglewood on the recent taste-testing day, pizza also was a popular item.\n\nHow much does this cost?\n\nThe new menu might seem to cost a bundle, but the state's largest district is able to enjoy considerable economies of scale through serving 80,000 meals a day.\n\n\"Our purchasing power is greater than in many smaller school districts,\" Urban said. \"Obviously the more meals we serve, the more revenue we generate.\n\n\"It's like any other business,\" Urban added. \"We have to make sure that we're following good business practices.

About 52 percent of the school district's students — more than 38,000 students — receive federally subsidized free or reduced-price meals, based on poverty guidelines.\n\n\"The vast majority of those will be free,\" Urban said. \"A small percentage of those will be reduced-priced.

Follow along here for the latest with tropical disturbances.\n\nAs the Southeast begins the recovery process from Hurricane Helene, which left a death toll of at least 43 and caused billions in damage, the National Hurricane Center is tracking a hurricane and tropical storm in the Atlantic and a possible new tropical storm forming in Helene's wake.\n\nHelene, which weakened into a post-tropical cyclone Friday, is expected bring some rain and wind as it moves along the Kentucky-Tennessee border Saturday, then across southern Pennsylvania and Virginia before heading out into the Atlantic Ocean by Tuesday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is also watching other storm activity in the Atlantic Ocean including Tropical Storm Joyce, which formed in the central tropical Atlantic Ocean on Friday. The storm was located about 1,120 miles east of the Northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds of near 50 mph.\n\nTropical Storm Joyce, which has tropical storm-force winds currently extending up to 105 miles from its center, is moving to the northwest at 10 mph and is expected to weaken as it turns northwest and north Sunday night and Monday, the center said.

Isaac is moving east-northeast at 20 mph and is expected to turn to the northeast over the next couple of days. Its maximum sustained winds are near 105 mph with hurricane-force winds extending up to 45 miles from its center. However, the storm is expected to be a post-tropical cyclone on Monday.\n\nNeither Isaac nor Tropical Storm Joyce pose threats to the United States.\n\nHowever, another an area of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean Sea could by the middle of next week, the NHC said. Environmental conditions are expected to be \"conducive for additional development\" and it could form into a tropical depression as it enters the Gulf of Mexico during the middle to end of next week, the NHC said Saturday.That system, if it strengthens to a named storm, would likely be called Tropical Storm Kirk. It has a 40% chance of developing over the next seven days, the center said.\n\nShould a storm develop it is expected to be west of the path of Helene, AccuWeather senior director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin said in a forecast. \"At this early stage, however, it is too early to rule out any possibilities regarding the future track of a potential tropical storm,\" DePodwin stated.\n\nAnother tropical depression could form next week in the eastern and central tropical Atlantic, the center said. Currently west of the Cabo Verde Islands, the system is expected to move west and northwest across the Atlantic.

Whatever happens, Florida will get drenched this week, and millions in south Florida face the risk of flash flooding.\n\nThe storm moving over the Gulf Coast is bringing several inches of rain across most of Florida, according to the National Weather Service. There is a high risk of dangerous rip currents along the Atlantic coast through Friday morning and coastal flooding possible at high tides, with advisories in effect until Thursday on the east coast. A high surf advisory is in effect from northeast Florida south to Southern Brevard until Friday, with large breaking waves of 4 to 9 feet in the surf zone.\n\n\"As the storm moves from west to east across the Florida Peninsula, it will begin to tap tropical moisture from the Caribbean,\" AccuWeather Storm Warning Meteorologist Joe Bauer said.

For the latest, view our story for Tuesday, Sept. 24.\n\nA brewing storm in the Caribbean Sea is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico over the next few days and make landfall along the Gulf Coast as early as Thursday.\n\nBy Monday evening, the National Hurricane Center predicted the storm – still officially a \"potential cyclone\" but soon to be named Helene – will reach 115 mph before landfall, making it a \"major\" Category 3 storm. Tropical storm watches were hoisted late Monday for portions of the Florida Keys as the storm slowly moves north.\n\n“Everyone along the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region needs to be prepared for hurricane impacts,” said AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva, adding that the setup has the potential to become the strongest hurricane landfall in the U.S. so far this season.\n\nWeatherTiger Meteorologist Ryan Truchelut put it succinctly in an online post: \"Helene will come at you faster than you think, so go into hurricane mode now. While there remains uncertainty in both the track and intensity forecast, Florida isn’t getting out of this one.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday declared a state of emergency for 41 counties along and near Florida's Gulf Coast because of threats from the storm. The declaration said there's a significant risk of storm surge and flooding, particularly in areas still recovering from the elevated water levels left behind by Hurricane Debby.\n\nMost forecast models suggest a hurricane landfall in Florida or the northern Gulf Coast on Thursday, Weather.com meteorologist Jonathan Erdman said.\n\nThe system, elevated to \"potential tropical cyclone nine\" status Monday morning, will be named Helene once it becomes a tropical storm, which is expected to happen overnight.\n\nTropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were also issued for portions of western Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico.\n\nGulf Coast residents should prepare now, forecasters say\n\nUnlike many hurricanes that track for days or weeks across the Atlantic Ocean, giving people ample warning for landfall, this one is forecast to develop and strengthen rapidly once it enters the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n“Now is the time to start preparing for a hurricane landfall along the Gulf Coast. Don’t wait for this storm to be officially named,” AccuWeather meteorologist Jon Porter said.\n\nHe said there is the potential that this storm could further strengthen into a major hurricane, which is a Category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale with maximum sustained winds of 111-129 mph.\n\nThis could be the storm that the 2024 hurricane season is remembered for, Porter said.\n\nTrack the storm:Tropical storm could form in Gulf of Mexico early this week\n\nWhere is the system now?\n\nNational Hurricane Center Deputy Director Jamie Rhome said in a Monday late afternoon update that the system was expected to become a tropical storm overnight.\n\n\"The latest trends and satellite imagery suggest that it’s starting to organize,\" he said.\n\nAs of 5 p.m., the system was roughly 450 miles south of Key West, Florida.\n\nTropical storm force winds are expected across the Keys by 8 p.m. Wednesday, before it pushes northward across the rest of Florida overnight and into Thursday.\n\n\"The wind field with this system is going to be really large, larger than you're used to seeing with a traditional hurricane and what that means is it's going to push a big swath of storm surge across the western portions of the Florida peninsula,\" Rhome said.\n\nThe Hurricane Hunters investigated the developing storm Monday, the center reported.\n\nStorm could rapidly intensify into a formidable hurricane\n\nForecasters at the hurricane center warn that the system could intensify rapidly over the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe \"environmental and oceanic conditions appear favorable for significant strengthening,\" the hurricane center said in a Monday discussion. One model shows a 95% chance of the storm's winds increasing by 75 mph or more over the next 72 hours, the center said.\n\nThe system is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.\n\nHelene could become a formidable hurricane in the Gulf, according to Erdman, who said there is plenty of deep, warm water in the northwest Caribbean and parts of the Gulf of Mexico to power up the storm.\n\nIn fact, Erdman reported that Gulf of Mexico heat content is at record high levels for this time of year, according to University of Miami tropical scientist Brian McNoldy.\n\n'Taking all precautions:' Florida farmers brace for hurricane\n\nThe storm threatened to make landfall just two weeks shy of the six-year anniversary of Hurricane Michael, which took a heavy toll on Panhandle farms, wiping out timber and other crops.\n\nJeff Pittman, a fourth-generation peanut and cotton farmer in Jackson County, Florida, watched the forecast with trepidation. Hurricane Michael damaged his peanut crop, destroyed his cotton crop, killed livestock and wrecked barns, fences and irrigation systems.\n\nPittman's farm was preparing for the latest storm’s arrival. Just ten days into peanut harvesting season, he said they stopped the inverters that dig up the crop. He was also making sure generators were in place to supply water to his and his neighbors’ cows.\n\n“We’re taking all precautions, everything we can think to do,” Pittman said. “We’re taking this very seriously. It looks like it could be a very serious situation come Thursday.”\n\nWhat are the expected impacts from Helene?\n\nWind: Sustained winds of at least 115 mph are possible. Powerful wind gusts of up to 120 mph are expected where the storm makes landfall on Thursday.\n\nRain: Widespread 8-12 inches of rain are likely, potentially leading to \"considerable\" flooding. Rounds of rain will arrive as early as late Tuesday afternoon or early evening starting over the Keys and moving northward, according to the Florida Public Radio Emergency Network.\n\nPower outages: Regional and localized power outages are expected across the Florida Panhandle and Big Bend region, as well as across much of Georgia, Alabama, southern Tennessee and pockets of far western South Carolina and North Carolina, AccuWeather said.\n\nTornadoes are also a major threat as the storm approaches later in the week.\n\nHigh surf: In a marine forecast, the hurricane center warned it expects seas in the southeastern Gulf to reach 15 feet by Wednesday morning and peak at 25-30 feet on Thursday morning.\n\nStorm surge also a serious threat\n\nStorm surge will be a danger with the hurricane as it moves closer to the Gulf Coast. The highest chances for the deepest storm surge will be near where the storm makes landfall.\n\nAccording to the hurricane center's latest analysis, the swath of coast with locations that could see a 1 in 10 chance of a storm surge greater than 9 feet stretches along the entire coast from Cape Coral north to Alligator Point. The higher the wind speeds, the higher the potential storm surge could be.\n\nFourth landfalling hurricane this year?\n\nIf the storm makes landfall as a hurricane, it would be the fourth landfalling hurricane in the mainland United States this year, joining Beryl, Debby and Francine.\n\nThree other years since 2000 have had four hurricane landfalls: 2004, 2005 and 2020, said Phil Klotzbach, senior research scientist at Colorado State University.\n\nStorm tracker\n\nSpaghetti models for Caribbean system\n\nExperts had predicted an 'extraordinary season'\n\nFederal forecasters earlier this year predicted an \"extraordinary\" season: As many as 24 named storms possible.\n\nA typical season sees 14 named storms, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\n\nHurricane John threatens Mexico\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean, the hurricane center said Monday night the center of Hurricane John was forecast to move inland along the coast of southern Mexico within hours.\n\nThe system had strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph.

Truchelut is a Florida meteorologist who works with the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn a telephone interview Friday, AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter warned residents along the Gulf Coast to not \"let your guard down\" as a system of low pressure could form over the western Caribbean.\n\n\"Another serious threat for a tropical storm or hurricane could eventually emerge from this area of concern. It's in the same general area in the northwestern Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico where Helene got started.\n\n\"Experts are identifying this as a medium risk area for a tropical storm to develop. It could find itself in the southern Gulf of Mexico ... and then be a threat to the Gulf Coast. If it tracks toward Florida, that would be extra special concern after the serious impact this week from Helene.\"\n\nWhere is the potential tropical threat to Florida, US Gulf Coast?\n\nA large and disorganized area of low pressure located over the western and southwestern Caribbean Sea is producing disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity.\n\nEnvironmental conditions could become conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression could form in a few days while the system is over the southern Gulf of Mexico or northwestern Caribbean Sea.\n\nWhile residents in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the progress of this system, the timetable for potential development has shifted later toward late week or this weekend.\n\nFormation chance through 48 hours: low, near 10 percent.\n\nFormation chance through 7 days: medium, 40 percent.\n\nTimeline: When could tropical depression or tropical storm develop?\n\nAccuWeather meteorologists said the area from the western Caribbean to the Gulf of Mexico will remain a potential tropical development zone into the first half of October.\n\n\"Over the next week, one to two tropical storms could be born in this zone and possibly steered across part of the southeastern United States that was hit hard by Hurricane Helene.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center updated its timeline at 5 p.m., saying \"a tropical depression could form in a few days while the system is over the southern Gulf of Mexico or northwestern Caribbean Sea.\"\n\n\"At this range and without an actual disturbance to watch, I’d simply say that it’s perhaps a little more likely than not something eventually develops in the Caribbean in the next 4 to 8 days, though not a certainty,\" Truchelut said Sunday.\n\n\"That is of course concerning, as a steering ridge over the western Atlantic would again mean anything that does develop is probably heading northwest into the Gulf by the end of the week.\"\n\nIs Florida, Gulf Coast really at risk from another tropical storm or hurricane after Helene?\n\nDownpours can be strewn anywhere from Louisiana to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas in the U.S., according to AccuWeather.\n\nAs southwesterly breezes increase, they will tend to cause moisture and any tropical feature that has formed or is trying to form to be guided to the north or east later next week into the following weekend.\n\nIf those steering breezes remain weak, then a track toward Louisiana could occur, said AccuWeather.\n\nIf there are strong steering breezes from the southwest occur, then a track toward Florida and perhaps the coastal areas of Georgia and the Carolinas would be more likely.\n\nLater, downpours could stretch anywhere from Louisiana to Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas in the U.S.\n\nThe most likely scenario with this week's tropical feature is that it will get drawn northward to a point over the Gulf but then shunted northeastward late this week, AccuWeather said.\n\nHow is this developing tropical system different from Hurricane Helene?\n\n\"This week's disturbance will likely be slow to develop as it expands northward, encountering more land masses and wind shear,\" Anderson explained.\n\n\"There will also not be any storm diving southward through the central U.S. to provide that extra energy and northward pull.\"\n\nHelene was a very large storm that moved into an environment that encouraged rapid intensification, including very warm water and little wind shear to tear it apart. A non-tropical storm moving south through the central U.S. provided even more energy to Helene and helped send it north into the Appalachians and mid-Mississippi Valley, AccuWeather said.\n\nA dip in the jet stream \"would tend to favor anything that forms eventually angling northeast or east-northeast over the eastern Gulf, more sharply than Helene’s north-northeast heading,\" Truchelut said, although it could also increase wind shear.\n\nThis developing system also is much smaller than Helene.\n\nWhat impacts could Florida, Gulf Coast see?\n\nWind shear may prevent this storm from rapidly strengthening and may even split it apart into two separate entities, the second one may follow the first one a few days later,\" Anderson said,\n\nA strong and more compact storm would result in a risk of strong and potentially damaging winds across parts of the Southeast from Friday through next weekend, AccuWeather said.\n\nBoth scenarios — one strong storm or two weaker ones — can deliver excessive rainfall to part of the Southeast.\n\nPlease note, until an organized center of circulation forms, there is a great deal of uncertainty on where and what this could do.\n\nStay informed.

For the latest on the storm, view USA TODAY's live updates for Tuesday, Aug. 6.\n\nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. − Debby, now a tropical storm, roared ashore Monday along the Big Bend coast of Florida, killing at least four people, flooding streets, and causing widespread power outages as the storm roared toward Georgia and South Carolina, where it's expected to bring catastrophic flooding this week.\n\n\"Tornadoes, catastrophic flash and urban flooding, coastal flooding, rip currents, strong gusty winds are all expected,'' in parts of the Southeast over the next several days, the National Weather Service said.\n\nAn apparent tornado touched down on Edisto Beach, South Carolina after 9:30 p.m. Monday, according to the National Weather Service in Charleston. There were multiple reports of structures damaged on Edisto Beach and across the river from Edisto Island from the radar-confirmed tornado, the weather service said.\n\nOther popular beach destinations, including Kiawah Island and Johns Island, were being warned of possible tornado activity as additional severe storms moved onshore.\n\nDebby, the fourth named storm of what is predicted to be a historic hurricane season, made landfall Monday at 7 a.m. near the coastal town of Steinhatchee as a Category 1 storm with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Steinhatchee, about 70 miles west of Gainesville and home to some 500 people, is just 10 miles from where Hurricane Idalia came ashore last year.\n\nAfter more than three hours moving across northern Florida, Debby was downgraded to a tropical storm with sustained winds of 70 mph, the hurricane center said in its 11 a.m. ET update. By 11 p.m., the winds had diminished to 45 mph, though the storm was still dropping copious amounts of rain.\n\nState officials reported widespread flooding and inundating storm surge as Debby moved inland. The storm's winds uprooted trees and toppled utility poles, knocking out power to more than 250,000 homes and businesses throughout northern Florida. Forecasters said Debby's powerful winds could also spawn tornadoes, and storm surge could reach 10 feet in some areas.\n\n\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nOn Sunday, President Joe Biden declared an emergency across Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the Florida National Guard and Florida State Guard were activated to support humanitarian assistance and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nBreaking news, in-depth analysis: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Briefing for news you need to know now.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Vice President Kamala Harris postponed her campaign rally scheduled for Friday in Savannah, Georgia, because of the expected deluge there, campaign officials said.\n\n∎ The storm surge produced by Debby brought 25 packages of cocaine with a street value of more than $1 million to a Florida beach, where a passer-by noticed them and alerted authorities, a Border Patrol official posted on the X platform.\n\n∎ The National Hurricane Center recorded a 98 mph wind gust near Horseshoe Beach, according to the Florida Severe Weather Network, a collection of state-run weather stations.\n\n∎ The National Water Prediction Service projected major flooding in three locations on the Santa Fe River and a location on the Suwannee River in north Florida.\n\n∎ Debby wreaked havoc on travel. More than 1,700 flights had been canceled and upwards of 5,800 were delayed Monday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware. The Federal Aviation Administration said all flights at Orlando International Airport have been grounded while airports in Tallahassee and Gainesville were closed.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the Southeast coast\n\nDebby is projected to move slowly across northern Florida before unleashing \"potentially historic heavy rainfall\" across the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nWidespread rainfall totals of 10-20 inches are expected from northern Florida to southeastern North Carolina, while parts of northern Georgia and South Carolina, including Charleston, could get upward of 30 inches of rain through this weekend, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, said in a YouTube livestream.\n\nDebby is expected to head into the Atlantic Ocean by late Tuesday night, then regain strength for a day or two before soaking the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina, whose governors have already declared states of emergency as they urge residents to prepare.\n\nNorth Carolina and the mid-Atlantic will start getting heavy rain by midweek, the prediction center said, and tropical storm effects could be felt as far north as southern New England late in the week, AccuWeather reported.\n\nDeath toll up to four after truck driver is killed\n\nAt least four storm-related deaths have been reported in Florida.\n\nThe driver of a semi-truck was killed overnight near Temple Terrace after losing control of his vehicle on a wet Interstate 75 northeast of Tampa, the National Weather Service reported.\n\nThe three previously reported deaths linked to the storm included a woman and a 12-year-old girl killed in a car crash and a teenage boy killed when a tree fell on a mobile home.\n\nThe truck driver, a 64-year-old man from New Albany, Mississippi, lost control of the truck at around 2:30 a.m., Sgt. Steve Gaskins, a public affairs officer with the Florida Highway Patrol, said in a news release. The truck rotated on the wet highway, collided with a concrete barrier and went over the wall, coming to rest hanging over a bridge. Gaskins said the cab came loose from the trailer and fell into a deep canal below.\n\nDivers from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office responded shortly afterward and found the deceased driver still inside the cab underwater in the canal, according to an X post by the Sheriff’s office.\n\nLt. Scott Tummond, a spokesperson for the Levy County Sheriff's Office, told USA TODAY on Monday that more trees could fall after torrential downpours soaked the ground, posing a threat to residents on the road at night.\n\n\"If you're moving around after dark, you might not see it until it's too late, especially if you're driving,\" he warned.\n\nFallen tree kills 13-year-old amid Hurricane Debby\n\nA 13-year-old boy was killed as Hurricane Debby made landfall along the Florida coast Monday morning, the Levy County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\nDeputies responded to a report of a tree that had fallen onto a mobile home around 8 a.m. in Fanning Springs, about 35 miles east from where the hurricane came ashore. The boy who died was \"crushed inside the home,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,” the sheriff’s office said, urging people to be careful as they begin to assess the storm damage. “Downed power lines and falling trees are among the many hazards. One life is too many. Please be safe.”\n\n– Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\n\nRisk of tornadoes\n\nWith the center of Debby about 35 miles west of Brunswick, Georgia at 11 p.m. Monday, the Storm Prediction Center said a risk of tornadoes continued in the storm’s northeast quadrant, along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nThe center said it would likely extend a tornado watch for at least some of the 13 counties in the region beyond the scheduled 1 a.m. expiration. In addition to the earlier tornado on Edisto Island, the weather service said it had confirmed a tornado on radar on Kiawah Island around 11 p.m.\n\nSouth Carolina town under curfew ahead of storm\n\nAuthorities in Charleston, South Carolina, issued a curfew from 11 p.m. Monday through noon Tuesday ahead of what forecasters warn could be a calamitous storm.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency on Sunday as Tropical Storm Debby readied to hit South Carolina’s coast this week. The center will move offshore late Tuesday and Wednesday and approach the coast on Thursday.\n\nThe governor said that as of Monday, he does not anticipate needing to issue any evacuation orders or order the closure of state facilities or agencies. John Quagliariello, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said the state would likely see \"historic rainfall\" that would result in \"catastrophic\" flash flooding.\n\n\"It's very likely that some areas that have never flooded in the past will be impacted this time,\" Quagliariello said.\n\n– Savannah Moss, Greenville News\n\nTown still recovering from Idalia gets walloped by Hurricane Debby\n\nDonna Luce lost power at 6 a.m. Monday and said rain came down for hours as the storm approached and eventually made landfall. Her home’s rain gauge showed 7 inches of rain fell Sunday alone, she said.\n\n“It is still raining pretty hard and we expect to get that most of the day, kind of like it’s sitting right here on top of us,” Luce told USA TODAY on Monday morning.\n\nMany fellow residents in Mayo, a small town about 30 miles north of where Debby came ashore, have spent the past year recovering from Hurricane Idalia, said Luce, 65.\n\n“Most people had just gotten their roofs repaired, and had gotten back up on their feet,” she said, adding that several of her neighbors still had tarps on their roofs this summer. “Now it’s hitting us again one year later and we are a little discouraged.\"\n\n– Claire Thornton, USA TODAY\n\nFlooding from Hurricane Debby could last 5-10 days\n\nThe widespread flooding and significant storm surge Debby has caused across northern Florida are expected to last several days, DeSantis said Monday.\n\nKevin Guthrie, the executive director for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said some parts of southwest Florida received up to a foot of rain as Debby approached the Big Bend region. He added that flooding in northern Florida will be widespread as up to 20 inches could fall over the next few days.\n\nGuthrie cautioned people to stay indoors as flash floods break out inland and storm surge continues to inundate coastal communities.\n\nThe flood threat from Hurricane Debby, Guthrie said, \"is probably going to be here for the next five to seven days, maybe as long as 10 days depending on how much rainfall we get.”\n\nStorm sounds like a freight train, uproots trees\n\nAlice Brown and her husband were awoken by what sounded like a freight train early Monday morning. They soon realized it was the wind and rain lashing their home as Hurricane Debby approached the Big Bend region and eventually made landfall.\n\n“This was the strongest wind and most rain I’ve ever seen,” Brown told USA TODAY.\n\nBrown, 68, lives in downtown High Springs, a small city of some 6,000 people outside Gainesville. While she did not lose power, several of her friends had their power knocked out overnight and were still without it Monday afternoon.\n\nJordan Huey, one of Brown’s neighbors, woke up to a tree falling within inches of his son’s bedroom. Another tree in his yard uprooted and destroyed at least 20 feet of his fence. Huey still had not been able to assess the damage because powerful wind gusts were still hurling tree limbs and other debris outside.\n\n“This is the worst it’s ever been in our area,” said Huey, 52.\n\nSeveral reports of more than 10 inches of rainfall\n\nDebby is leaving behind some eye-popping rain totals, including the 16.56 inches over two days reported by a weather station at Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County. There have been several reports of more than 10 inches of rain across the county, including 12.43 inches at the Sarasota Bradenton airport.\n\nThe weather service in Jacksonville issued a flash flood warning for parts of four counties in north Florida, saying between 7 and 14 inches of rain have fallen, and another 3 to 6 inches are possible.\n\nWith Debby's center still over north Florida by early afternoon, a daily rainfall record was set at Charleston International Airport in South Carolina, with 2.29 inches to that point, according to meteorologist Steven Taylor with the National Weather Service in Charleston.\n\nTaylor also reiterated the forecast of 10-20 inches of rain with localized amounts near 30 inches is still on track. \"The situation still looks favorable for a historic rainfall event with areas of catastrophic flooding. This is a potentially significant and life-threatening event,\" he said.\n\nWoman, girl die in crash as Hurricane Debby approached Florida coast\n\nA woman and a girl died in a single-vehicle crash in Dixie County on Sunday night, the eve of Hurricane Debby’s landfall, according to a law enforcement report.\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol troopers arrived at the scene of the crash around 9:30 p.m. A 38-year-old woman and 12-year-old girl were pronounced dead, while a 14-year-old boy was seriously injured and rushed to a hospital for treatment.\n\nWitnesses told the Florida Highway Patrol the car lost control “due to inclement weather and wet roadway.”\n\n“After losing control, the vehicle struck the guardrail in the center median, then redirected, overturning, leaving the roadway to the right,” the Florida Highway Patrol said. The crash is under investigation.\n\nMore than 130K without power after Debby makes landfall\n\nMore than 130,000 homes and businesses in Florida, the majority of them in the north, were without power by 12 a.m. ET on Tuesday as Debby continued its path across the state.\n\nThe outages were most abundant from Wakulla to Levy County, according to Poweroutage.us. In Taylor County, where Hurricane Debby made landfall at 7 a.m., more than 97% of utility customers lost power at one point. In several surrounding counties, that figure was well over 80%.\n\nAt a news conference Monday morning, DeSantis said 17,000 linemen across the state were poised to begin restoring power once the storm passes.\n\nForecasters watching tropical system near Caribbean\n\nDebby wasn't the only storm forecasters were watching Monday. They were also keeping an eye on another developing tropical system that was approaching the Caribbean Sea.\n\nAlthough chances for development were low as of Monday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said \"environmental conditions are expected to become more conducive for development later this week as the system moves across the western Caribbean Sea or the southern Gulf of Mexico.\"\n\nIf its winds eventually reach 39 mph, the system would become a named tropical storm. The next name on the list is Ernesto. It's too early to determine if there will be any impact to the U.S. from this system.\n\nPacific sets 50-year record for storms\n\nThe eastern Pacific hurricane season has also heated up: The Pacific currently has four named storms spinning at the same time: Carlotta, Daniel, Emilia and Fabio. This is the first time since August 1974 that the eastern North Pacific has had four named storms simultaneously, according to Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.\n\nNone of the four storms are forecast to approach or impact land as they spin far out to sea in the Pacific, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nThe activity in the Pacific comes after a very slow start to the season. For the first time since the satellite era began in 1966, the entire North Pacific saw no named storm activity between June 1 and July 3, Klotzbach said.\n\nWhat makes Debby such a treacherous storm?\n\nDebby is a large and slow-moving storm, making the system particularly dangerous as record amounts of rain inundate many areas, especially along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina in the coming days.\n\nThe storm’s center was forecast to move near Savannah, Georgia, on Tuesday night and drag along the South Carolina Coast on Thursday night. \"Multiple days of very, very heavy rainfall\" are possible, Brennan said. The National Weather Service estimates rainfall totals could reach up to 30 inches or more in isolated locations along the coast through Friday.\n\nDebby shows there's more to a storm than wind scale\n\nThe widespread flooding caused by Debby even after being downgraded to a tropical storm illustrates how the wind scale categories used to define hurricanes can fall short of telling the whole story of their impact, scientists say.\n\n\"This is another example of a storm where the primary impacts are going to be from water, rather than wind,\" said James Franklin, a retired branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the National Hurricane Center.\n\nJennifer Collins, a professor in the Geosciences School at the University of South Florida, has studied how to better communicate all of a storm’s threats. Looking at the forecasts of up to 30 inches of rain in isolated locations between Savannah and Charleston, Collins said she’s very concerned about the likelihood of “catastrophic flooding.\" Read more here.\n\nDebby tracker\n\nSpaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal.

The peak of the season is Sept. 10, and the most activity usually happens between mid-August and mid-October, according to the hurricane center.\n\nAfter Hurricane Beryl's deadly rampage in July, forecasters from Colorado State University raised their already record hurricane forecast.

With widespread rainfall amounts of 4-8 inches expected, Nadine will spur localized flash flooding across southern Mexico, northern Guatemala and northern Belize.\n\nTropical storm conditions were expected along parts of the coasts of Belize and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico through Saturday afternoon, the hurricane center said. Isolated amounts of rain exceeding 12 inches are also possible through late Tuesday.\n\nNadine poses no threat to the U.S. As the storm moves inland, it is expected to weaken and likely dissipate over southeastern Mexico by early Sunday, the center said.\n\nListeria outbreaks:Tracking listeria outbreaks and recalls across the US: Where are the cases?\n\nTropical Storm Nadine tracker\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm.

The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nHurricane Oscar expected to intensify, then slow\n\nHurricane Oscar was located about 165 miles east-southeast of the southeastern Bahamas and was moving west at 12 mph as of Saturday afternoon. Oscar is expected to undergo some intensification as it gradually slows and turns to the west-southwest over the next couple of days.\n\nOscar could stall near the northeastern coast of Cuba within 36 to 48 hours. Tropical storm conditions are expected in parts of the southeastern Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands and eastern Cuba in the next day, and heavy rainfall will begin Saturday and continue overnight.\n\n\"Dangerous\" storm surge was also expected to produce coastal flooding in the Turks and Caicos Islands with water levels 2 to 4 feet, the hurricane center said.\n\nHow Oscar went from a tiny storm to a Cat 1 hurricane in hours\n\nFor a week, the National Hurricane Center had watched a disorganized area of showers moving across the Atlantic waiting to see whether it would develop, first increasing, then decreasing the chances it would become something more. On Saturday morning, a variety of images showed the little storm had suddenly come to life, developing a closed, tight circulation. The hurricane center warned just before 8 a.m. that it was organizing and had a 60% chance of becoming a named storm later on Saturday.\n\nA little more than two hours later, the center announced it would start issuing advisories for Tropical Storm Oscar at 11 a.m. By 2 p.m. it was a hurricane with 80-mph winds after an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter flight found an eye, dropping pressure and hurricane-force winds.\n\nBased on the hurricane center’s advisories, Oscar’s winds increased 40 mph in just three hours, although the winds may have been higher than initially estimated. It's still a small storm: Hurricane-force winds extend out only up to 5 miles from the center and its mean diameter is just about 80 miles.\n\nOscar is at least the fifth hurricane this year to undergo a phenomenon called rapid intensification, when winds increase at least 35 mph in 24 hours.\n\nHurricanes can take advantage of conditions such as warm ocean water and low wind shear to quickly gain strength, and waters in the Caribbean and this area of the Atlantic are warmer than normal. These warm waters have fueled storms all summer. Hurricane Beryl gained 95 mph in wind speeds in just 42.5 hours. Then Milton’s winds increased by 95 mph in just 24 hours. Helene and Francine also rapidly intensified.\n\nHurricane Oscar tracker\n\nHurricane Oscar spaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nWhen does the 2024 hurricane season end?\n\nAbout six weeks remain in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which typically runs from June 1 through Nov. 30. So far this season, there have been 15 named storms. The next storm to form will be named Patty.\n\nAfter a relatively quiet five weeks or so, the 2024 season – especially with the arrival of Helene and Milton – became an above-average hurricane season, according to Klotzbach. He noted that typically, the 14th storm named in the Atlantic Ocean forms on Nov. 19, in a post on X.\n\nThrough Oct. 28 there is a 50% chance for tropical development, Colorado State University meteorologists said in a recent two-week forecast. \"There are hints of potential additional development in the western Caribbean late in the forecast period, but these signals are fairly weak,\" CSU forecasters said.\n\nAtlantic storm tracker\n\nContributing: John Gallas, Cheryl McCloud and Doyle Rice of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

History has shown the Gulf of Mexico can be a pressure cooker, turning systems like this one from wimpy windstorms to devastating monster storms almost overnight under the right conditions.\n\nIn this case, the hot stove is already on, with warmer than normal water across the Gulf expected to help boost the storm’s winds as much as 75 mph by Thursday morning.\n\nThat means the brewing system is likely to become Hurricane Helene on Wednesday, then see an increase in winds that makes it a Category Three hurricane with 115 mph or more as it approaches Florida’s Big Bend on Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center Forecast.\n\nTuesday updates:Hurricane watch for Florida Gulf Coast\n\nThe storm is forecast to strengthen with potential explosive force in the Gulf. It’s called rapid intensification and it’s happened before. In fact, most of the worst hurricanes in history have experienced rapid intensification, Ken Graham, the National Weather Service director, has said in interviews with USA TODAY.\n\nThat includes two recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico: Hurricane Michael, which struck near Mexico Beach in the Florida Panhandle in 2018, and Hurricane Ian, which hit Florida’s southwest coast in 2022.\n\nThe fierce official forecast for the Gulf storm is still below the increase some computer models predict. Hurricane experts say the higher-end forecasts for peak winds and low barometric pressure could materialize if the storm develops a classic tropical cyclone structure before it moves into the southern Gulf of Mexico.\n\nEven though forecasting a rapid transition in storms has improved, accurately forecasting such radical events is still considered “the wild, wild west,” said David Roth, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nWhat is rapid intensification?\n\nA period during which wind speeds in a storm rapidly accelerate. The technical definition is an increase of least 35 mph in a 24-hour period, but storms can intensify more than that or continue to intensify over a longer period under the right conditions.\n\nRapid intensification typically occurs when a storm moves into or over warm water. Plentiful moisture and warmer water provide energy that helps hurricanes build the high cloud pillars that give them additional strength.\n\nWater temperature in the Gulf is at a record high for this time of year, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior research scientist at the University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School.\n\nWind shear is expected to be lower as the storm moves into the Gulf of Mexico, which reduces the risk that high cloud tops could be torn apart by opposing winds.\n\nIn June, Beryl took advantage of warm waters in the eastern Caribbean, becoming a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph. It had gained 95 mph in wind speeds in just 42.5 hours, beating out all but a few previous hurricanes.\n\nWhy is rapid intensification so dangerous?\n\nHigher wind speeds that develop during rapid intensification have a two-fold impact on storms and make it more difficult to plan and enforce evacuations. During previous storms people in harm's way have gone to bed in the evening expecting a lower end hurricane and woke up in the morning to find themselves facing something else entirely.\n\nHurricane Otis in the eastern Pacific last summer saw its winds increase 110 mph in 24 hours, shocking the residents of Acapulco, Mexico.\n\nThe higher winds and lower pressure are more destructive on their own, but higher winds also push more water forward in storm surge, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, where the continental shelf tends to increase the height of surging seawater as a storm makes landfall.\n\nThe west coast of Florida, including Tampa Bay, is particularly vulnerable to storm surge, Jamie Rohme, the hurricane center’s deputy director said Monday.\n\nWhich hurricanes have rapidly intensified?\n\nOf the 10 hurricanes with 150 mph winds or greater that made landfall in the contiguous United States in just over 100 years, all but one of them exploded in force and power during rapid intensification.\n\nHurricane Ian in 2022 had two such bursts of rapidly intensifying winds, briefly reaching 155 mph before making landfall at Cayo Costa in Southwest Florida on Sept. 28, 2022.\n\nHurricane Andrew, the storm that devastated parts of Southwestern Miami Dade county in Florida in 1992 also rapidly intensified. Andrew increased from a minimal hurricane to 175 mph winds in just 36 hours, and its central pressure dropped 72 millibars, as it closed in on the Bahamas. Its winds were still 165 mph when it made landfall in Miami on Aug. 24.\n\nIn 2021, Hurricane Ida exploded in intensity as it approached the Louisiana coast. Its wind speeds increased from 85 mph to 150 mph in 20 hours, making it one of the fifth-strongest hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland.\n\nAre forecasters improving at forecasting rapid intensification?\n\nImprovements in data collection through the work of hurricane hunters and developing technologies, such as the dropsondes and drones deployed by the aircraft, have provided more information to the computer models used in forecasting.\n\nA decade ago, the National Hurricane Center wasn’t forecasting rapid intensification, but significant progress has occurred since then.\n\n“We were pretty successful in Idalia,” the Center Director Michael Brennan told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\nHowever, like Roth, Brennan and others say forecasting rapid intensification is still challenging. Both Beryl and Otis surprised meteorologists with the degree to which they intensified.\n\nIs climate change playing a role?\n\nMany scientists say yes.\n\nTom Knutson, a senior scientist with NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, has previously stated that although scientists remain unsure about the long-term overall impacts of warmer temperatures on tropical cyclones, rapid intensification is expected to increase in a warmer climate.\n\nSome scientists say climate change already is reflected in the rapid intensification seen in recent hurricanes.\n\nA new study published by Princeton University researchers in February concluded rapid intensification events are “already more hazardous than normal cyclones and future climate warming causes large increases in the likelihood of (rapid intensification) close to land.”\n\n(This story was updated to correct a misspelling/typo.)\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver covers climate change and the environment for USA TODAY.

In October, a Lion Air plane of the same model crashed into the Java Sea minutes after departing from Jakarta, Indonesia. None of the 189 passengers and crew survived.\n\nBoth flights crashed after drastic speed fluctuations during ascent. Both pilots made ill-fated efforts to return to their airport of origin after takeoff.

In the event of a delay, policies vary by airline, but you may be entitled to compensation based on the length of your wait and other factors.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY'S summary of what you're owed.\n\nWhat is the Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) system?\n\nA Notice to Air Missions provides pilots and other flight personnel with real-time, safety information concerning flight operations and airports.\n\nNOTAM lists potential hazards and conditions that can impact flights – from runway construction or possible icing to a change in an aeronautical facility or flight service.\n\nPilots are required to consult NOTAMs before starting every flight.\n\nThe FAA notes that a NOTAM “states the abnormal status of a component of the National Airspace System (NAS) – not the normal status.” The federal agency adds that NOTAMs are “not known far enough in advance to be publicized by other means.”\n\nWhat is the NOTAM system? The FAA outage causing flight delays across the US, explained.\n\n\"It’s a safety issue,\" Abdelghan said. \"God forbid if the pilots are not updated with abnormal conditions it might lead to some serious problems like accidents or something like that.\"\n\nThe NOTAM system was telephone-based in the past, with pilots calling flight service stations for the information, but it has now moved online.\n\n— Wyatte Grantham-Philips, USA TODAY.

He also reiterated that Friday's outage \"was not a security or cyber incident.\"\n\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said she spoke to Kurtz Friday and confirmed the incident did not appear to be related to a cyber attack.\n\n“At this point, we believe that it is an IT-related patch, an issue with that patch,” she said while speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. \"I think they're determining what went wrong there.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\n‘I’m just hoping to make it onto a flight’\n\nChance Ortego had reached the finish line of a nearly two-week work trip when he saw the news all air travelers dread: his flight was delayed.\n\nOrtego was in the AirTrain en route to his flight from San Francisco International Airport when he heard other travelers discussing the outage. After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment.

John Thune, R-S.D., as the next Senate majority leader after rejecting public overtures from allies of President-elect Donald Trump who backed a different candidate.\n\nThune won in a secret-ballot vote of 29-24, beating out opposing candidate Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in the second round of voting. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., also ran but was eliminated in the first round of voting after receiving the least votes of the three.\n\nThe 63-year-old Thune will succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has led his chamber's Republicans since 2007 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history.\n\nThe Senate majority leader is one of the most powerful people in Washington – and soon will have an important say over Trump's agenda. Thune will have the power to set the schedule for the Senate, which has sole control over confirmation of the Cabinet, about 1,200 other high-level government jobs and a president's judicial nominees.\n\n\"It's a new day in the United States Senate and it's a new day in America,\" Thune told reporters after the vote. \"This Republican team is united. We are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThune's win is even more significant because Republicans regained control of the upper chamber in the November election, putting the GOP on track to hold total control over Congress and the White House for the next two years.\n\nScott didn't make it past the first round of voting despite having the support of prominent Trump allies including Tucker Carlson, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The latter two were tapped by the president-elect on Tuesday to lead a new \"Department of Government Efficiency\" to slash federal government spending, waste and regulations.\n\nTrump's Senate allies had also been advocating for Scott, who has a longstanding relationship with the president-elect and who is typically more ideologically conservative than Thune or Cornyn. However, Trump did not decide to endorse in the race himself.\n\nHowever, Scott's supporters expressed confidence that Thune would be an effective leader.\n\n\"I was for Rick Scott because I thought the communication was going to be better between him and President Trump because both of them are business guys,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who is close with Trump, but added that he's \"got no problem\" with Thune or Cornyn.\n\n\"He's just got to prove himself to President Trump that he's 100% and will push his agenda. And I think he will,\" Tuberville said.\n\nScott also said in a statement that he \"will do everything possible to make sure John Thune is successful in accomplishing President Trump's agenda.\"\n\nThune was long considered the favorite in the three-way race, given his No. 2 position in the Senate Republican leadership, though Cornyn was also considered a serious contender.\n\nThune has served as whip since 2019 and campaigned heavily for his GOP colleagues during this election cycle, a metric often used to size up candidates' fundraising prowess and willingness to help out the party. Thune raised $33 million this cycle and attended more than 200 events for Republican candidates, according to his office.\n\nConservative media personalities and Trump allies honed in on Thune's close ties to McConnell, arguing he would be a continuation of McConnell's style of leadership. Trump and McConnell have had a famously frosty relationship.\n\nBut Thune argued his leadership experience would allow him to effectively lead the conference – and represent Trump's interests in Congress.\n\n\"We have an ambitious agenda, and it will take all of us – each and every Republican – working together with President Trump’s leadership to achieve it,\" Thune wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. \"If we don’t successfully execute on our mandate, we risk losing the coalition that swept Republicans into office up and down the ballot.\"\n\nThune has served in the Senate since 2005. Before that, he was South Dakota's at-large representative in the House for six years.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building, Thune was among the many senators of both parties who condemned the rioters and opposed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Trump then called for someone to challenge Thune in his 2022 primary, but no one emerged, and Thune prevailed.\n\nThune initially endorsed Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in the 2024 GOP primary, but later supported Trump after Tim Scott dropped out of the race for the White House.\n\nIn the months since, Thune has worked to repair his relationship with Trump, including visiting Mar-a-Lago and speaking with him several times on the phone, including as recently as last week. He also met with members of the Trump transition team in September, according to his office.\n\nStill, Thune on CNBC over the weekend urged the president-elect not to “exert” influence over the Senate leadership election.\n\nMost senators kept their preferences secret ahead of Wednesday's vote. But three senators publicly endorsed Thune: National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.; and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.\n\nDaines' endorsement may have been particularly helpful for Thune – Trump is a fan of the NRSC chair, who led the GOP to flip the chamber in this election. Trump was pushing Daines to enter the leadership race, though Daines declined.\n\n(This story has been updated with more information and new photographs.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/13/trump-transition-live-updates-appointments/76222529007/", "title": "Trump transition recap: Rubio to be nominated for Secretary of State ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – President-elect Donald Trump unveiled a series of new hires on Wednesday as he continues building out his new administration, including plans to nominate two Florida Republicans to critical jobs: Rep.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has resigned \"effective immediately.\"\n\nTrump announced on Wednesday that he's nominating Gaetz to serve as attorney general in his second term, a move that raised eyebrows even among some of his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n- Marina Pitofsky\n\nHouse Republicans agree to change rules protecting speaker\n\nTwo factions of the House Republican conference that have often been at odds with one another - the House Freedom Caucus and the Main Street Caucus - have agreed to a rule change that could protect Speaker Mike Johnson from an insurgent push to topple him.\n\nAt issue is a procedural tool that Rep. Matt Gaetz and other conservatives used to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and has often been blamed as a source of the chaos in the chamber for the last two years.\n\nBecause any one member can force a vote to oust the Speaker, each member has more leverage than is typical.

Matt Gaetz for attorney general signaled a like-minded approach to overhauling the Justice Department after both men were investigated criminally.\n\nBut the choice also sparked some of the first criticism of Trump's cabinet selections, as senators questioned whether the Florida Republican would be a serious choice to become the country's top law enforcement official.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's five takeaways from the surprising announcement.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\n5 takeaways from Trump's return to DC\n\nTrump met with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office for nearly two hours on Wednesday as the outgoing president did what Trump wouldn't four years ago − extend a helping hand and embrace a peaceful transfer of power. Trump addressed congressional Republicans earlier in the day on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe image of Trump sitting next to Biden, shaking hands, marked an extraordinary moment that crystallized Trump's remarkable comeback: from a twice-impeached, four-times-indicted former president − whose supporters waged a violent insurrection at the Capitol − to the soon-to-be 47th president.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's five takeaways from the president-elect's swing through DC.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nAfter Trump endorsement, GOP backs Mike Johnson for second term as House speaker\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to return as their leader next year as the GOP prepares to govern alongside President-elect Donald Trump and with complete control of Washington's main power levers.\n\nJohnson's win isn't surprising. He ran unopposed and there were no objections before the unanimous voice vote.\n\nIt's also not the final say on the matter. Johnson still must notch a majority of votes from the 435-person chamber during a public floor vote in early January that will keep him in a job that also means he's second in line for the presidency after Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\n- Karissa Waddick and Riley Beggin\n\nDemocratic senator 'speechless' over Gaetz nomination\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he was “speechless” over Trump's decision to nominate Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general.“I look forward to the confirmation hearings, to hearing their views and reviewing their qualifications and considering,” said Coons.Asked whether his Republican colleagues would go along with Trump’s picks, Coons said the choice is “up to them.”“That's the choice they're going to have to make. Our system works when the guardrails work, which requires both the courts and the Congress to work. The confirmation process requires us to review thoroughly and seriously the appropriateness, qualifications, character of nominees. I hope we will do so,” Coons said.— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump chooses firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz to run Justice Department as attorney general\n\nTrump announced Wednesday he chose Rep. Matt Gaetz, a firebrand lawmaker who has been a harsh critic of the Justice Department even as he was investigated by it, as attorney general.\n\nThe Florida Republican has been a vocal critic of the department from his seat on the Judiciary Committee and a staunch defender of Trump. Gaetz accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of weaponizing the department and said he agreed with special counsel Robert Hur's decision not to charge President Joe Biden for mishandling classified documents because he was \"senile.\" Gaetz also accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of being \"blissfully ignorant\" about how agents ran their investigations.\n\nGaetz demonstrated his willingness to fight the Washington establishment by opposing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and nearly scuffling with other lawmakers on the House floor during the dispute. Gaetz fended off a Republican primary challenge this year from a rival McCarthy supported.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump picks Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence\n\nTrump on Wednesday picked former congresswoman and Army veteran Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence, a cabinet-level post.\n\n\"I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nGabbard was a Democrat when she served in the House of Representatives from Hawaii from 2013 to 2021.

John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that senators will have a responsibility to seriously consider Matt Gaetz and any other nominees from President-elect Trump.\n\n“I assume we’ll have some questions for him,” Cornyn told reporters Wednesday when asked about the Florida congressman whom Trump announced he'd nominee to be attorney general.\n\nAsked about the House Ethics Committee's investigation into Gaetz for sexual misconduct, Cornyn said, “Well that might come up,”\n\n“I don’t know whether there’s any basis to it or not,” Cornyn said. “So I’m sure we’ll be asking a lot of questions.”\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump AG nominee Gaetz was probed in sex trafficking investigation\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who president-elect Donald Trump picked as his attorney general Wednesday, is being probed by the House Ethics Committee as a part of an ongoing investigation that includes allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus member and close Trump ally was also under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for allegations that he had sexual relations with a minor and paid for her travel and allegedly was introduced to him by a Joel Greenberg, a one-time friend who is serving an 11-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to sex trafficking in 2022. In February 2023, the DOJ ended the investigation without charging Gaetz.\n\n- Sam Woodward and Karissa Waddick\n\nMarco Rubio given nod for Secretary of State\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday confirmed he's chosen Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as Secretary of State in his next administration.\n\nRubio has deep foreign policy experience and has transformed from a Trump opponent to a close ally who was a finalist to serve as Trump's vice president.\n\nHe is currently the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio, a Cuban American, would be the first Latino person to serve as Secretary of State.\n\nRubio has expressed support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia, but voted against additional aid for the country last year. He recently said the war in Ukraine is going to end with \"a negotiated settlement,\" something Trump has also supported. He's also advocated for a tough approach to American adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.Trump and Rubio, 53, ran against each other in the 2016 Republican primary, which turned nasty as they lobbed insults at each other. But they patched up their relationship and worked together on shared foreign policy goals during Trump’s first administration. They grew closer during the 2024 campaign, when Rubio was on the short list to be Trump’s running mate and campaigned relentlessly for him.\n\nA fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who grew up in West Miami. He adds diversity to Trump’s Cabinet and foreign policy chops. A senator since 2011, he serves on the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees and has been one of the most outspoken lawmakers on confronting China and U.S. adversaries around the world.\n\nRubio is expected to easily gain Senate confirmation, with lawmakers from both parties already announcing their support for his nomination.\n\n- Riley Beggin and Zac Anderson\n\nMark Warner says he'll evaluate Cabinet nominees on individual basis\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he will evaluate at Trump's cabinet nominees on an individual basis. But he does have a preference for the next Secretary of State.\n\n\"I don't want to jump in front of the president-elect,\" Warner told reporters Wednesday. \"But should he go ahead and nominate my friend Marco Rubio? I think that'd be a very strong choice.\"\n\nTogether, Warner and Rubio serve as chair and vice-chair of the House intelligence committee.\n\nRubio is expected to be named as Trump's pick for the position, according to reports from CNN and New York Times.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nGOP wins control of the House\n\nRepublicans have won both the House and the Senate, giving the GOP total control over Congress for at least the next two years and creating a friendly path for President-elect Donald Trump's priorities.\n\nThe GOP will have a majority in the 435-member House after defending enough key seats in New York, California and other swing districts that had appeared more competitive before Election Day than they ultimately were, according to multiple networks tracking the results. Republicans also have taken control of the Senate by toppling Democratic senators in Montana and Ohio and prevailing in other closely watched races.\n\nTheir victory sets up a Republican trifecta in Washington for the next two years, laying the groundwork for Trump and the party to implement their priorities without major resistance.\n\nJohn Thune will be next Senate Majority Leader\n\nSen. John Thune will be the next Senate Majority Leader. He won 29-24 in a secret ballot election.- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump backers lament Thune's election as Senate majority leader\n\nTrump hasn't said anything - yet - but allies are already squawking about John Thune's election as Senate Republican majority leader.\n\nTrump World has feuded for years with Thune, seeing him as a clone of frequent Trump critic Mitch McConnell. Trump himself tried, unsuccessfully, to field a GOP primary challenger to Thune in 2022.\n\nThe president-elect did not weigh in on the Senate majority leader race, but prominent allies campaigned against Thune in favor of Florida Senator Rick Scott.\n\nAfter Thune prevailed, Trump backer Charlie Kirk said on X that Thune \"has a short window to show us he will support President Trump, fill his cabinet, confirm his judges, and pass his agenda.\"\n\n\"If he does, we will support him,\" Kirk said. \"If he doesn't, we will work to remove him.\"\n\nBuckle up.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nRick Scott is out on the first ballot in the election for the Senate majority leader\n\nScott received the fewest votes in the secret ballot election despite a public pressure campaign from conservative media and Trump allies.\n\nNow senators will move into a second round of votes to determine whether Sen. John Cornyn or Sen. John Thune will be the next leader.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nGOP lawmakers enthused about Department of Government Efficiency\n\nRepublican lawmakers expressed support for the new Department of Goverment Efficiency, to be headed by businessmen Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n“I think it's one of the most important things that we can take on in this next administration,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. “With our federal debt approaching $36 trillion this has created the inflation crisis in America. I fully support it,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said.\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told reporters that while he supports the new department, he expects Congress will push back.\n\n“Congress always needs to do oversight, so we always need to protect our authority, right?” said Guthrie. “And so there, I assume whatever they suggest, they'll be statutory changes that we'll need to make, and then obviously, Congress will have a role…if there's anything that we feel requires change of statute, then Congress will have its role definitely.”\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublicans say they will red stamp Trump’s agenda\n\nDressed in a red Trump tie and $399 gold Trump sneakers, Rep. Troy Nehls said that if it weren’t for Trump, the GOP would have lost the House.\n\n“His mission and his goals and objectives, whatever that is, we need to embrace all of it, every single word,” Nehls said.\n\nFor leaders in the House, Nehls said that means, “if Donald Trump says, jump three feet high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch our head.”\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWill Speaker Johnson face opposition?\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said she expects Speaker Mike Johnson to face opposition for his gavel but would not say which members exactly would be the ones to challenge him.\n\n“It’s a big game of trust and there’s not a lot of trust in Washington,” Luna told reporters leaving House Republicans’ meeting with Trump Wednesday morning.\n\n“Hopefully though everyone can unify behind the president’s agenda,” she continued.\n\nLuna declined to say how she would be casting her vote for leadership.\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump arrives on the Hill\n\nTrump arrived at the Hyatt Hotel for his meeting with Congressional Republicans at 10 a.m.\n\nHis motorcade pulled into the back of the hotel.\n\nTrump is expected to meet with Joe Biden at the White House at 11 a.m.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nJack Smith to step down as special counsel investigating Trump, reports say\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, plans to step down before the president-elect takes office, the New York Times reported citing people familiar with Smith's plans. Smith and his team plan to finish their work and exit before Trump can make good his pledge to fire Smith within “two seconds” of being sworn in. CNN also reported the move, citing a Justice Department official familiar with the discussions.\n\nSmith's case involving classified documents Trump kept after leaving office was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida, but Smith's team has filed an appeal. In a case in Washington charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, Smith asked for and received a monthlong pause to the filing deadlines. The Justice Department is working to determine how to proceed in both cases, but department policy has been against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSome Republicans aren’t concerned about narrow House majority\n\nReps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY that they aren’t worried about a narrow GOP majority in the House as Trump taps GOP members for cabinet roles. Lawler acknowledged that the margin will be \"very tight\" until those moving into administration roles are replaced.\n\n“Ultimately, I think if we are focused on addressing the major issues, I would imagine there will also be Democrats voting in favor of legislation,\" Lawler said. \"It won't really be that much of an issue.\"\n\nHe added that Trump was picking “really solid members who will do a great job in the administration.”\n\nSome of Trump’s picks include Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as U.N. ambassador and Rep. Mike Walz, R-Fla., as national security advisor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is also expected to be named secretary of state, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times.\n\nStefanik and Walz's House seats will have to be filled by holding special elections, while Florida Gov.

As for Rubio’s spot, he’s optimistic.\n\n“The Senate, of course, they can do an immediate appointment, so that's not as big of a deal,” Roy said. “Absolutely, that'll be immediately filled.

Kristi Noem to be his secretary of Homeland Security, selecting another loyalist to lead an agency central to his efforts to crack down on the number of immigrants who enter the country without permission. In a statement late Tuesday, Trump heralded Noem for deploying her state's National Guard to the southern border. He said that she would work closely with his newly appointed \"border czar\" to secure the United States' southern border.\n\nNoem said in a statement she was \"honored and humbled\" by the appointment, which will require Senate confirmation. \"I look forward to working with Border Czar Tom Homan to make America SAFE again,\" she said. \"With Donald Trump, we will secure the Border, and restore safety to American communities so that families will again have the opportunity to pursue The American Dream.”\n\n− Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump taps South Dakota Gov.

Three senators are running to replace him in an election that will take place behind closed doors Wednesday.\n\nTwo senators are considered the main contenders: Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who is currently second-in-command in the Senate GOP as Republican whip, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has also served as whip and previously led the Senate GOP’s campaign arm. Both have longstanding relationships with McConnell.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBut several of Trump’s most recognized allies, including Musk, are mounting a campaign to get Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., elected as McConnell’s successor. Senators who are close to Trump – including Sens. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. – have backed Scott, too.\n\nThey argue Scott is the only candidate who has been sufficiently loyal to Trump and would be best equipped to represent the president-elect’s interests. Some are poking at a yearslong rivalry between Trump and McConnell that flared up after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"A vote for Rick Scott is a vote to END the anti-Trump rot of Mitch McConnell in the US Senate,” conservative podcaster Benny Johnson posted on X. “Thune and Cornyn are a continuation of McConnell's total failure.\"\n\nThat's not all. Musk on Sunday simply shared on X, \"Rick Scott for Senate Majority Leader!\" Carlson accused Cornyn's positions of being \"indistinguishable from Liz Cheney’s,\" one of Trump's most vocal critics. And Kennedy responded to Carlson's post, sharing, \"Without Rick Scott, the entire Trump reform agenda wobbly.\"\n\nThune and Cornyn have been active fundraisers and campaigners for their fellow senators and are popular with their colleagues. Their supporters say they would bring decades of experience to the leadership role and could hit the ground running to enact Trump’s agenda.\n\nBoth Republican senators have worked to rebuild their relationships with the president-elect and say they stand ready to pursue his goals, including a recent demand to accelerate confirmation of his Cabinet and judicial nominees.\n\nStill, Trump has not publicly indicated he plans to endorse in the three-way Senate race − which will be conducted by secret ballot. If he did weigh in, a public pressure campaign is a gamble: It could change the direction of the race, or senators might reject Trump’s choice.\n\nHere’s what to know about each option.\n\nJohn Thune\n\nThune, 63, was first elected to the Senate in 2004. As the Republican whip, he is responsible for ensuring his party has enough votes to accomplish its goals in the upper chamber.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building, Thune was among the many senators of both parties who condemned the rioters and opposed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Trump then called for someone to challenge Thune in his 2022 primary, but no one emerged, and Thune prevailed.\n\nThune initially endorsed Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., in the 2024 GOP primary, but later endorsed Trump after Scott dropped out of the race for the White House.\n\nIn the months since, Thune has worked to repair his relationship with the Trump, including visiting Mar-a-Lago and speaking with him several times on the phone.\n\nStill, Thune on CNBC over the weekend urged the president-elect not to “exert” influence over the Senate leadership election.\n\nMany senators are playing their cards close to their chests ahead of Wednesday's vote. But Thune has three public endorsements so far: National Republican Senatorial Committee chair Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont.; Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.; and Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla.\n\nJohn Cornyn\n\nCornyn, 72, has served in the Senate since 2002. He was the GOP whip before Thune and chair of the NRSC, the campaign arm for Senate Republicans, from 2009 to 2013. Before joining the Senate, he was Texas’ attorney general.\n\nCornyn also condemned Trump's actions on Jan. 6, 2021, and later said he didn't think Trump could win another presidential race. However, he endorsed Trump’s reelection bid in January this year.\n\nHe had less bad blood with Trump to begin with but has also worked to endear himself to Trump since then. Cornyn spent time on the campaign trail with Trump in Texas and Nevada and also visited Mar-a-Lago to speak with Trump during the campaign.\n\nHe has one public endorsement at the moment: Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nRick Scott\n\nScott, 71, won a second term in the Senate last Tuesday. He was first elected in 2019 after serving as the governor of Florida, where he initially forged a relationship with Trump.\n\nBefore running for governor, Scott was the CEO of a for-profit hospital chain at the time the Department of Justice found it had defrauded Medicare and Medicaid and fined it $1.7 billion. Scott argued during his 2010 campaign for governor that the Justice Department targeted his company but has admitted that he “made mistakes” in the role.\n\nScott has led a small cohort of Republican senators who oppose McConnell and align more closely with Trump. In 2022, he ran against McConnell for the leadership position and lost 37 to 10. Some of his colleagues remain frustrated with GOP losses under his leadership as NRSC chair during the 2022 elections.\n\nScott has touted his close relationship with Trump as he campaigns for the leadership spot. He has noted that Trump’s soon-to-be chief of staff, Susie Wiles, ran his gubernatorial campaign, creating an immediate connection with the next White House.\n\n“We have got to change the way the Senate is run to get Trump’s agenda done,” Scott said on Fox News on Sunday. “I’ve talked to my colleagues. I think everybody realizes we need to make a change. So the question is going to be: Who is going to make sure we get these things done?”\n\nHe has the endorsement of Johnson, Rubio, Hagerty, Tuberville and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nConfirmation demands\n\nTrump has not indicated he plans to endorse in the race, despite his allies jumping in, but he has started making demands of the candidates.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner.”\n\nBy demanding \"recess appointments,\" he’s asking the leaders to agree to dismiss the chamber to allow Trump to appoint temporary nominees without lengthy confirmation battles – a tactic that former President Barack Obama used in the past and was the focus of a Supreme Court case. He also insisted that Republicans prevent Democrats from confirming any more judges while President Joe Biden remains in office.\n\nAll three candidates moved quickly to show their support for the idea.\n\n“100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,” Scott wrote on X within minutes of Trump’s post, prompting Musk to endorse him for leader.\n\nThune told Fox News “all options are on the table.”\n\n“One thing is clear: We must act quickly and decisively to get the president’s Cabinet and other nominees in place as soon as possible to start delivering on the mandate we’ve been sent to execute, and all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments,” he said.\n\nAnd Cornyn posted on X: “It is unacceptable for Senate Ds to blockade President @realDonaldTrump’s cabinet appointments. If they do, we will stay in session, including weekends, until they relent. Additionally, the Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/28/mcconnell-senate-gop-republicans-retirement-congress/72778637007/", "title": "Who will replace Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader?", "text": "WASHINGTON – Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's announcement that he will be stepping down from his leadership post in November surprised many of his GOP colleagues – and kicked off immediate speculation about who would replace him.\n\nThere are three senators who have long been considered likely replacements: Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., John Cornyn, R-Texas, and John Barrasso, R-Wyo. But there will likely be others who step forward for a shot at the crown.\n\nThe transition comes at a unique moment for Republicans in Congress. The populist wing of the party exemplified by former President Donald Trump has steadily grown, prompting clashes between conservatives and more traditional, moderate Republicans.\n\nTensions between McConnell and GOP senators have flared repeatedly, leading to a failed attempt at replacing him in 2022. In the last month alone, he has clashed with ultraconservative senators over a bipartisan border security package and additional funding for Ukraine.\n\nMcConnell's announcement also comes as Republicans are poised to flip control of the chamber: They only need to gain one seat or the presidency in the 2024 election to take the gavel back from Democrats.\n\nMost GOP senators on Wednesday said they didn't yet know who they'd support. Quipped Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D.: \"I wouldn't tell you if I did, because then I wouldn't get all those free dinners\" from senators campaigning for the spot.\n\nHere's what to know about the likely candidates to serve as the next Senate GOP leader:\n\nSouth Dakota Sen. John Thune\n\nCurrently the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, Thune serves as the minority whip, responsible for figuring out where GOP lawmakers stand on policy and ensuring they stick together on important votes.\n\nThune, 63, has been in the Senate since 2005 and was in the House for six years before that. Swarmed by reporters after McConnell announced his decision on the Senate floor Wednesday, Thune said McConnell \"leaves really big shoes to fill.\" Nevertheless, he didn't say whether he would run to replace the Kentucky lawmaker.\n\nHe's seen by many as the natural heir, given McConnell has prepared him for the role. But that might work against him as right-wing senators seek a fresh start.\n\nThune was once an outspoken critic of Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and initially supported Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. to be the GOP candidate for president this fall. Trump called for someone to challenge him in his last primary election over the comments.\n\nHowever, Thune endorsed Trump earlier this week – more than three months after Scott dropped out of the presidential race.\n\nWyoming Sen. John Barrasso\n\nBarrasso, 71, is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate as chair of the Republican Conference. He has served in the Senate since 2007, which he joined after serving in the Wyoming Senate and working as an orthopedic doctor.\n\nHe has a close relationship with McConnell, but he was one of the first Senate Republicans to endorse Trump's reelection campaign. He has also thrown his support behind more conservative Senate candidates such as Arizona's Kari Lake and Ohio's Bernie Moreno.\n\nBarrasso on Wednesday told reporters there's a more important election in November than the race to replace McConnell: \"That's my focus.\"\n\nTexas Sen. John Cornyn\n\nCornyn, 72, does not hold a formal leadership role, though he previously served as GOP whip for six years.\n\nHe has been in the Senate since 2002. Beforehand, he was the Texas attorney general and an associate justice to the Texas Supreme Court. He has also led the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm.\n\nCornyn endorsed Trump in January and has never backed any of the other Republican candidates vying for the 2024 GOP nomination, though he's previously cast doubt on Trump's ability to win this fall.\n\nHe told reporters he didn't plan to announce a run Wednesday, but \"I've made no secret of my intentions.\"\n\nWildcard candidates\n\nThe likely wildcard candidate to watch is Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who challenged McConnell as leader in 2022. He lost in a 37-10 vote, but he hasn't ruled out vying for the spot again. He said Wednesday, however, that his focus is on his reelection campaign this fall.\n\nHe has been a leading critic of McConnell's in recent years and a prominent voice among the ultraconservative wing of the Senate GOP. He is also a vocal supporter of Trump.\n\nAnd the Florida senator may already have some supporters. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he has \"an open mind\" but noted he supported Scott in 2022 and touted his role in getting the contentious debt ceiling deal across the finish line last year.\n\n\"He tenaciously kept holding weekly meetings with House conservatives. None of us had ever agreed to support an increase in the debt ceiling but working through that process, we said ok we'd rather get something than nothing,\" he said.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is also reportedly considering a run. He's close with McConnell, but may first be vaulted into another lower-down leadership role.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was one of the lawmakers who voted to oust McConnell in 2022, and he has recently called on McConnell to step down from his leadership post. The senator on Wednesday wouldn't say whether he would support Cornyn, his fellow Texan.\n\nSen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said there are 10-15 people interested in the job. The first thing that needs to happen, he said, was for Trump and McConnell to \"get on the phone together and talk about it.\"\n\nThe Alabama lawmaker also said McConnell should endorse Trump and make sure \"they're on the same page\" so he can effectively support GOP candidates through the 2024 election – even as \"a lame duck leader.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/10/24/mitch-mcconnell-louisville-forum-takeaways-trump-election/75810832007/", "title": "Mitch McConnell 'free at last' when he leaves Senate leadership ...", "text": "U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had three words Wednesday when asked about his future after he steps down from his leadership post next month.\n\n\"Free at last,\" he said, earning a laugh from the crowd at the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce's private forum at the Omni Louisville Hotel.\n\nStill, don't expect the seven-term Bluegrass State senator to start cashing retirement checks any time soon. With two years left in his term after he gives up his role as the Republican party's Senate leader, McConnell said he plans to spend that time finding an answer for \"the biggest problem we have in the world right now that everybody hasn't sort of awoken to yet.\"\n\n\"We're up against the most dangerous international situation since World War II,\" McConnell told the crowd. \"Our adversaries are communicating with each other — the North Koreans, the Chinese, Russians, Iran. Iran's proxies are shooting at us now. The question is, what do you do?\"\n\nMcConnell pointed toward the president who served when he first took office for a resolution.\n\n\"(Ronald) Reagan had it right,\" McConnell said. \"You get peace with strength. ... We have to invest more in defense and working with our allies — because what's developing here is the autocratic world is challenging us, and challenging every democracy in the world.\"\n\nMcConnell spoke for a little more than 30 minutes at Wednesday's luncheon among Kentucky business and community leaders, including state Reps. Keturah Herron (D-Louisville) and Michael \"Sarge\" Pollock (R-Campbellsville) along with University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel. Here are a few key points McConnell made:\n\nSome breaks with Trump\n\nDespite their rocky relationship, McConnell did not break from former President Donald Trump when reporters asked about his reelection bid following the forum. He's previously endorsed the Republican nominee in next month's election, which he expects to be \"a cliffhanger.\"\n\nStill, the senator had clear disagreements with Trump in some of his comments on stage.\n\nIn an audience filled with executives keeping a close eye on next month's election, McConnell said he's \"not enthusiastic\" about Trump's call to put tariffs in place on foreign goods shipped into the United States. While he was critical of trade practices under current President Joe Biden, the senator said tariffs would cause \"problems with Europe.\"\n\n\"You go down that path, everything becomes more expensive,\" he said. \"Think of it as just raising your cost of living.\"\n\nMcConnell also said isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world would not solve domestic problems, drawing a straight line between the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and the onset of the war between Russia and Ukraine the following winter. That line of thinking did not help the U.S. in the leadup to World War II, he said.\n\n\"Isolationism is not a new thing. In the '30s they even called it 'America First' — sound familiar?\" McConnell told the crowd, a reference to Trump's foreign policy. \"... You don't stop it by ignoring it. If we decided we wanted to pursue isolationism, they'd still hate us. The only difference is it would guarantee that we lost.\"\n\nA loss of title but not influence\n\nMcConnell is leaving his leadership role, but he doesn't think he'll stop being a leader in his party.\n\nThe senator had the worst seat on the floor when he took office in 1985 due to seniority, he said, and can remember looking down the aisle at those in front of him, wondering if he'd ever move up the ladder.\n\nBut times change, and by 2007 he was the GOP's Senate leader, the title he'll relinquish before the end of 2024. But while McConnell is \"actually looking forward the next couple of years\" to focus on other priorities, as one of the GOP's longest-tenured senators, he still expects to be influential.\n\n\"Even though I won't have that title next year, I think people will still have an interest in what I have to say,\" he said.\n\n'The Price of Power'\n\nMcConnell is no stranger to media attention — \"what I'm known for, by the way, is passing the press and never answering any questions,\" he joked.\n\nBut a new biography being released next week puts McConnell back in the spotlight. The book from author Michael Tackett is titled \"The Price of Power: How Mitch McConnell Mastered the Senate, Changed America, and Lost His Party,\" and bills itself as \"the first definitive biography of Mitch McConnell\" on Simon & Schuster's website.\n\nExcerpts have already made the rounds. In the book, McConnell is reported to have called Trump \"stupid as well as being ill-tempered,\" \"despicable\" and a \"narcissist,\" following the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell participated in its production and told the crowd the author, who he'd never met, told the senator of his intentions in 2021 and \"it was clear to me it would be smart for me to actually participate.\"\n\n\"I told him he wouldn't have any trouble finding my enemies. I have a lot of them,\" he said. \"But I'd like to refer you to some of my friends.\"\n\n\"It's coming out next week — and I'm nervous,\" McConnell added, drawing a laugh from the room.\n\nReach Lucas Aulbach at laulbach@courier-journal.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/11/donald-trump-election-appointments-2024/76194522007/", "title": "Trump transition updates: Picks for UN ambassador, EPA lead are in", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump is making pivotal picks for his second administration, including tapping Stephen Miller, one of his longest-serving top immigration advisers, as deputy chief of staff for policy in the incoming White House.\n\nThe quick appointment of the hardline conservative signals Trump plans to move aggressively on the \"America first\" agenda he ran on.

Rick Scott is making waves in his push to become that chamber's majority leader – even though his opponents might have better odds in a process that typically favors insiders.\n\nThe Florida Republican received an endorsement Sunday from tech titan Elon Musk, immediately signed on to a request from President-elect Donald Trump to push appointments through while the chamber is in recess and is aggressively courting the diehard Trump wing of the GOP.\n\nScott’s opponents for the position are Sens.

He demanded probes of baseless election fraud claims in the 2020 race he lost. After leaving office, Trump faced prosecution in two federal cases for alleged election interference and mishandling classified documents.\n\nHere is a sample of candidates – from among lawmakers, members of his first administration and appointees – who are being considered, according to news reports and people working on the transition:\n\nTrump justice:Who will Donald Trump name as U.S. attorney general?\n\n− Bart Jansen\n\nFormer Kamala Harris aide says Joe Biden should resign so she can serve as 47th president\n\nJamal Simmons, a former communications director for Kamala Harris, made an unlikely suggestion about how the vice president might still have a chance of becoming president in 2024: If Joe Biden steps down from office.\n\nAsked on Sunday what they thought would be the most important thing to watch for in the 71 days until President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration, panelists on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Scott Jennings, Ashley Allison and Brad Todd pointed to the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza or Trump’s actions while setting up his administration.\n\nSimmons went in a different direction. Biden, he said, “could resign the presidency in the next 30 days (and) make Kamala Harris the president of the United States.”\n\n“Joe Biden’s been a phenomenal president,” Simmons said. “He’s lived up to so many of the promises he’s made. There’s one promise left that he can fulfill: being a transitional figure.”\n\n– George Fabe Russell\n\nMissouri Sen. Eric Schmitt pulls out of attorney general's race\n\nThe jockeying for jobs in the next Trump administration is well underway – and is starting to include the names of people who are pulling themselves out of the various races.\n\nFor example: Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., confirmed Monday he has asked Trump transition officials not to consider him for attorney general.\n\n\"I ran for the U.S. Senate to represent the people of the Show Me State and I’m just getting started,\" Schmitt said in a post on X.\n\nAmong the names thought to still be under consideration for the Justice Department: Mike Lee, a senator from Utah; John Ratcliffe, Trump’s former Director of National Intelligence, and Jeffrey Clark, a former assistant attorney general.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nTrump advised Putin not to escalate war with Ukraine\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and advised him not to escalate the Ukraine war, a source familiar with the conversation told Reuters on Sunday, as President Joe Biden plans to urge Trump not to abandon Kyiv.\n\nTrump and Putin spoke in recent days, said the source. Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday. Trump has criticized the scale of U.S. military and financial support for Kyiv, vowing to end the war quickly, without saying how.\n\n– Reuters\n\nStephen Miller named Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy\n\nDonald Trump has tapped Stephen Miller, one of his longest-serving top immigration advisers, as deputy chief of staff for policy in the incoming White House.\n\nVice President-elect JD Vance congratulated Miller on his new role in a post on X after CNN first reported the move. \"This is another fantastic pick by the president,\" Vance said.\n\nMiller's appointment comes after Trump campaigned for president in 2024 on mobilizing mass deportations of undocumented immigrants who are in the country unlawfully.\n\nMiller, 39, served as senior advisor to Trump and director of speechwriting during the Republican's first term in the White House and is credited with shaping Trump’s immigration policies, which included separating migrant children from their families and a ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries. Miller played a central role in Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump asks Mike Waltz to be national security adviser\n\nTrump has asked Florida congressman Mike Waltz to serve as his national security adviser, according to two sources familiar with his selection.\n\nWaltz, 50, is set join the new administration as it navigates several tense geopolitical fights, including the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars. The role Trump asked Waltz to serve in does not require Senate confirmation.\n\nThe three-term lawmaker has been a member of the House Armed Services Committee, served in civilian roles at the Pentagon and is a decorated Green Beret combat veteran. He's also an outspoken critic of the Defense Department’s diversity programs.\n\nIn Congress, Waltz has demanded more defense spending from NATO allies and questioned the United States’ “blank check” for Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook, David Jackson\n\nWho will control the House next year? What about the Senate?\n\nRepublicans will take control of the Senate from Democrats in 2025. They're expected to control the chamber 53-47, though one Senate race in Arizona hasn't formally been called.\n\nIn the House, either party would need 218 seats to take control of the chamber. Republicans are poised to reach that crucial number: Of the 435 seats in the House, 203 have been called for Democrats, and 213 have been called for Republicans.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump picks Tom Homan, former head of immigration enforcement, to be 'border czar'\n\nTom Homan, the former head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will become a “border czar” overseeing deportation policy for undocumented immigrants and aviation security, President-elect Donald Trump announced.\n\nHoman was a controversial figure in Trump’s first term because he oversaw the “zero tolerance” policy that separated families of undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut he has been a vocal defender of strict immigration enforcement for Trump, who vowed a mass deportation of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants will begin on his first day in office Jan. 20.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Elise Stefanik? Donald Trump picks major House ally to be next UN ambassador\n\nDonald Trump has named Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to be the next ambassador to the United Nations, according to multiplereports. The New York lawmaker has accepted the offer.\n\nTrump's nomination of Stefanik, a longtime congressional ally, is his first cabinet pick after being reelected Tuesday for a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House.\n\nOne of Stefanik's most prominent moments came last year during a congressional hearing with college presidents from Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During the hearing, she asked them whether calling for the genocide of Jews warranted disciplinary action.\n\nAll three presidents waffled and dodged the question, instead offering legal responses without directly condemning calling for the genocide of Jews. Two of the presidents, former Penn president Liz Magill, and former Harvard President Claudine Gay, have since left their posts.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/16/midterm-election-results-live-updates/10707397002/", "title": "House goes red; Senate GOP sticks with Mitch McConnell as leader ...", "text": "Republicans won majority control of the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening, a blow for Democrats and creating a major roadblock for President Joe Biden's agenda for the next two years.\n\nRep.

Her deputy chief of staff tweeted late Tuesday that \"the Speaker plans to address her future plans (Thursday) to her colleagues.\"\n\nThe new GOP majority will usher in a new group of leaders in Washington. If elected to succeed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the top post, Kevin McCarthy would lead what will likely be a rowdy conference of House Republicans, most of whom are aligned with Trump’s bare-knuckle brand of politics.\n\nMany Republicans in the incoming Congress rejected the results of the 2020 presidential election, even though claims of widespread fraud were refuted by courts, elections officials and Trump’s own attorney general.\n\nBiden administration probes:What will a Republican House look like? A lot of investigations and maybe impeachment.\n\nMcCarthy won the nomination for House speaker on Tuesday, with a formal vote to come when the new Congress convenes in January.\n\n“I’m proud to announce the era of one-party Democrat rule in Washington is over,” McCarthy said after winning the nomination.\n\n- Ledge King and Associated Press\n\nHunter Biden, the southern border, Mar-a-Lago search: GOP has long list of probes it wants to launch\n\nWith House control now in Republican hands next year, expect GOP lawmakers to start investigations on a number of fronts including Hunter Biden’s business dealings and the migrant surge on the southern border.\n\nControl of the gavel in key committees overseeing the Biden administration means hardline conservatives will be able to probe what they’ve only been able to raise alarms about since they lost power in 2019.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, positioned to become speaker of the House, has vowed to immediately open an inquiry into the FBI's search of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n\"When Republicans take back the House, we will conduct immediate oversight of this department, follow the facts and leave no stone unturned,\" McCarthy said.\n\nSome of the most conservative lawmakers have raised the prospect of impeaching Biden, though that will be much harder for the party to accomplish with a tight majority.\n\n- Ledyard King and Associated Press\n\nPresident Biden congratulates Kevin McCarthy on Republicans winning House Majority\n\nPresident Joe Biden congratulated GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for Republicans winning control of the House of Representatives and called for bipartisanship in the next Congress to “get things done” for the American people.\n\n“I congratulate Leader McCarthy on Republicans winning the House majority, and am ready to work with House Republicans to deliver results for working families,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday night shortly after California’s House District 27 race was called for Republican Mike Garcia, giving Republicans a projected House majority.\n\nBiden added that “the future is too promising to be trapped in political warfare,” reiterating a theme from remarks he made last week after Democrats exceeded expectations in the midterm election.\n\n“The American people want us to get things done for them,” the president said. “They want us to focus on the issues that matter to them and on making their lives better. And I will work with anyone - Republican or Democrat - willing to work with me to deliver results for them.”\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nPelosi predicts Democratic leverage over 'scant Republican majority'\n\nCurrent Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi was undeterred in remarks late Tuesday about GOP House control.\n\n“This year, House Democrats defied expectations with an excellent performance: running their races with courage, optimism and determination,\" Pelosi said. \"In the next Congress, House Democrats will continue to play a leading role in supporting President Biden’s agenda — with strong leverage over a scant Republican majority.\"\n\nShe said Democrats in the House are \"thrilled\" to have key members returning.\n\n\"We salute our departing members for their magnificent leadership, achieving landmark progress on health care, climate action, infrastructure, gun violence, veterans and more that can never be diminished,\" Pelosi said.\n\n- Christal Hayes\n\nRepublicans react to Pelosi departure as speaker\n\nMany Republicans celebrated the victory of Mike Garcia in a California House race - the seat that gave the GOP control of the House - by preparing to get rid of Rep. Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi has officially been fired!\" tweeted Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the party.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi has been FIRED,\" a Republican National Committee research account tweeted.\n\n- Luciana Lopez\n\nMcConnell: ‘I’m not going anywhere’\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell emerged triumphant from the vote, in which he won about 75% of the tally.\n\n“I’m not going anywhere,” he said.\n\nMcConnell gave a smile and a thumbs up as he boarded an elevator on Capitol Hill Wednesday.\n\nMcConnell, who has been the Republican Senate leader since 2007, had faced a challenge from Florida Sen. Rick Scott following disappointing midterm election results, but said he didn’t take it personally.\n\n“I’m not in any way offended by having an opponent or a few votes in opposition,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nSenate GOP reelects Sens. John Thune, John Barrasso; replaces Rick Scott in leadership vote\n\nAs Senate Republicans voted to keep Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as the top GOP leader, lawmakers also reelected Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., as second-in-command as whip, and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., as the GOP conference chair.\n\nWest Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito was elected as vice chair of the GOP conference, replacing Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who was elected to serve as the party’s policy committee chair during Wednesday’s leadership vote.\n\nThe party also elected Montana Sen. Steve Daines as the National Republican Senatorial Committee chair, replacing Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who challenged McConnell for the top GOP leadership role instead. Scott lost to McConnell after three-quarters of the caucus voted for the Kentucky lawmaker.\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nSen. Cruz: Closed-door vote was ‘cordial discussion’\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, who voted for Rick Scott, called the closed-door meeting to determine Senate leadership a “cordial” discussion.\n\n“It was not a discussion that was focused on concessions, it was instead a largely cordial discussion, but a serious discussion about how in the minority we can effectively stop this administration's disastrous policies,” Cruz said.\n\nHe said he believes voters want bold, strong conservative leadership – and “not merely acquiescing.”\n\n“I think for the last two years the Republican Senate Minority did not use all the tools at its disposal and I think that’s insane, so that's the position I articulated forcibly,” he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nHawley: GOP must 'do something different if we ever want to be a majority party'\n\nMissouri Sen. Josh Harley, who voted for Rick Scott, told reporters after the meeting that the disappointing result of last week’s midterm election is reason enough for a change.\n\n“So we had independent voters that voted for Obama and then voted for Trump who disapprove of Joe Biden,\" he said. \"A sizable number of them stayed home rather than vote for Republican candidates. My view is that's why you look across these elections. That's why there wasn't a red wave.\n\n“And so I asked both of the candidates: ‘Do you acknowledge that as a fact? And what do you think we need to do differently?’ Because clearly, the Republican Party's got to do something different if we ever want to be a majority party.”\n\nAsked why he thought the overwhelming majority of the caucus stuck with McConnell, Hawley responded: “Because the conference doesn't want to change course. They want to do what we're doing. It's working so well.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nIn case you missed it:Donald Trump announces his 2024 presidential campaign as GOP debates future\n\nVote 37-10-1 to keep McConnell\n\nThree-quarters of the Senate GOP conference, or 37 people, voted to keep McConnell in his leadership position. Ten voted against him, and one person abstained.\n\nMcConnell gave reporters a thumbs up at a news conference after the vote.\n\n– Rachel Looker and Ledge King\n\nMcConnell to remain as Senate GOP leader\n\nSenate Republicans reelected Mitch McConnell as their leader Wednesday despite grumblings among some of his GOP colleagues that the caucus needs new leadership after a poor showing in the midterms, where Democrats defied expectations by retaining their slim majority.\n\nMcConnell, who has led Senate Republicans both in the minority and the majority since 2007, faced a challenge from Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who said the caucus should be \"far more bold and resolute than we have been in the past.\"\n\nScott received some support, including from Indiana Sen. Mike Braun who tweeted Tuesday that “Hoosier conservative Republicans are sick and tired of the status quo.”\n\nBut McConnell showed how firm his grip on the caucus is. He maintained his leadership position despite a midterm election where the GOP could see its minority shrink further depending on the Dec. 6 run-off in Georgia between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and GOP challenger Herschel Walker.\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nEffort to delay Senate leadership vote fails\n\nA motion to delay the vote for GOP leadership failed Wednesday morning, making it even more likely that Sen. Mitch McConnell will be reelected as leader.\n\nSenate leaders will now make nomination speeches.\n\nMcConnell has been nominated to remain in his position by Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nBraun: 'We’re political wallflowers' who need change at the top\n\nThe vote on whether to reelect Mitch McConnell as Senate GOP leader hasn’t started yet but at least one member of the opposition doesn’t believe his candidate – Florida Sen. Rick Scott – has the votes to topple the Kentucky senator.\n\nIndiana Sen. Mike Braun said it’s important to lay down a marker on what he sees as a Republican Party that’s been flailing lately.\n\n“So this is, I think, the start of where maybe some people want to start speaking up, unless you're completely happy with the results,” Braun said before entering the Old Senate Chamber for the vote.\n\nHe continued: “And I don't think we're generating the results politically or governmental. And I think the Democrats outmaneuver us in every election, they're always on every policy thing. And you know, we're political wallflowers. And we generally go along with what they want to do, and we don't have an agenda. We don't have a business plan.”\n\n– Ledyard King\n\nSenators arrive for GOP leadership elections\n\nRepublican senators began arriving for the Senate leadership election Wednesday morning.\n\nAmong those who walked into the Old Senate Chamber, where the vote will happen, included: Republican Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, James Risch of Idaho, John Thune of South Dakota, Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Mike Braun of Indiana.\n\nThe senators will decide who will lead them in the next Congress. Current Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is the heavy favorite to be elected.\n\n– Ledyard King, Rachel Looker\n\nWho will control the House?\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Republicans have won 217 seats and Democrats have 208 seats. Either party needs 218 for a majority. Ten seats remain uncalled.\n\nMitch McConnell 'welcomes' challenge from Rick Scott\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-K.Y., welcomed the competition for his leadership post from Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla, telling reporters during the Senate GOP news conference Tuesday, “Anybody in the conference is certainly entitled to challenge me, and I welcome the contest.\"\n\nMcConnell said he is confident he has the votes to keep his job, a role he’s held since 2007. \"I’ll be elected,” he added.\n\n– Sarah Elbeshbishi, Rachel Looker, Ledyard King\n\nRick Scott challenges Mitch McConnell for GOP leadership\n\nFlorida Sen. Rick Scott announced Tuesday that he will challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for the top Republican leadership spot in a letter to his colleagues, calling for a change in leadership. A leadership vote is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n“I believe it’s time for the Senate Republican Conference to be far more bold and resolute than we have been in the past,” the letter said. “There is a Republican Party that is alive and well in communities across America. It is time there is one in Washington, D.C. too. That is why I am running to be Republican Leader.”\n\nIndiana Sen. Mike Braun tweeted support for Scott on Tuesday. \"I ran for Senate because we need OUTSIDERS to take on the D.C. swamp and get RESULTS,\" he wrote. \"Hoosier conservative Republicans are sick and tired of the status quo.\"\n\n–Sarah Elbeshbishi, Rachel Looker, Ledyard King\n\nPreviously:House Republicans select McCarthy as GOP leader, Scott takes on McConnell to lead Senate GOP\n\nKevin McCarthy to remain GOP House leader, clearing way for speakership\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy was elected Tuesday by the GOP caucus to keep his job as Republican leader, making him the favorite to be the next speaker of the House in January. McCarthy beat back a challenge from Arizona Republican Andy Biggs, a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nWith some races still to be called, as of Tuesday night Republicans are one seat away from taking back the House. A win would put McCarthy in position to run the chamber starting in January. The official vote for speaker won't take place until Jan. 3 when lawmakers are sworn in. If McCarthy is chosen by the full House, he will replace Democrat Nancy Pelosi.\n\n– Candy Woodall, Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nSome opposition to McCarthy remains\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla, said Tuesday he would oppose McCarthy's bid for speaker no matter what, telling reporters that there is a \"critical mass\" of Republicans who oppose McCarthy.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy couldn't get 218,\" Gaetz said, referring to the majority of the 435-seat chamber. \"He couldn't get 200 votes. He couldn't get 190 votes today. So, to believe Kevin McCarthy is going to be speaker you have to believe he's going to get votes in the next six weeks that he couldn't get in the last six years.\"\n\n– Candy Woodall, Sarah Elbeshbishi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/11/15/election-2022-congress-live-updates/10698859002/", "title": "Republicans gather to decide leadership of next Congress: recap", "text": "House Republicans chose Tuesday to keep Kevin McCarthy as their leader, making him the favorite to succeed Democrat Nancy Pelosi as the next speaker when a new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3.\n\nNeither party has secured control of the House but Republicans are expected to narrowly capture the chamber when the vote counting ends.\n\nMore than a dozen races are yet to be called, but the already poor showing by Republicans in the midterms has several ultraconservative GOP lawmakers questioning whether to dump California Rep.

Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said he is a supporter of the former president and had dinner with him last week where the two discussed when is the best time to launch a presidential campaign.\n\n“I gave him my thoughts and opinions on when to, when not to (run), but he's going to do what he thinks is right for his campaign,” Tuberville said.\n\nTuberville said the former president has some “negatives” to overcome, but said he believes they will resolve themselves when Trump is on the campaign trail and starts talking about issues.\n\nTuberville, who said Trump helped him get elected, dubbed the former president the “heir apparent” when asked who he views as the current leader of the Republican party, but added that the GOP is still searching for one.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nMcConnell: ‘I welcome the contest’ for Republican leadership\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell predicted he has the votes to keep his job in the next Congress.\n\n“I’ll be elected,” he said during a weekly press conference on Capitol Hill Tuesday. “The only issue is whether we do it sooner or later and I think we’ll probably have another discussion about that tomorrow.”\n\nWhen asked about Florida Sen.

McCain tweeted a photo of her father, former Sen. John McCain, R-AZ, smiling with his thumbs up next to the photo of Lake with the word “loser” written across her photo.\n\nMcCain’s tweet referred to Lake calling the late Arizona senator a “loser” during a campaign event on Nov. 4 before telling supporters of the senator at her event to “get the hell out.”\n\nMcCain trolled Lake again Tuesday, tweeting “Beautiful morning to all of you” while sharing a National Review article titled “McCain Republicans Vote, Too.”\n\n- Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nElection of new GOP leader begins with McCarthy challenged by Biggs\n\nThe selection of a Republican House leader to assume the reins of the caucus and become the next speaker of the House began Tuesday afternoon with the nomination of Arizona Rep.

Although some members of the caucus are unhappy with McCarthy, it's unlikely they have the numbers to derail his path to the speakership.\n\nOne of the reasons McCarthy is expected to lead the Republicans once again is Jim Jordan, the ultra conservative Ohio Republican who commands a lot of respect in the GOP conference.\n\nJordan reiterated his support for McCarthy as he walked into the vote Tuesday.\n\n“You know where I stand,” he said to reporters.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nRon DeSantis declines to take Donald Trump's bait (or comment on 2024)\n\nFlorida governor and potential presidential candidate Ron DeSantis declined on Tuesday to comment on Donald Trump's new and incessant criticism, blowing it off as part of the territory.\n\n\"One of the things I've learned in this job is when you're leading, when you're getting things done, yeah, you take incoming fire – that's just the nature of it,\" DeSantis told reporters just hours before Trump announces his 2024 plans.\n\nDeSantis did not comment on Trump's announcement, nor did he discuss his own plans for 2024. He did find time to reference last week's elections, in which some Trump-backed candidates fell by the wayside while he racked up more than 59% in winning re-election in a key battleground state.\n\nDiscounting all the \"noise\" from the \"corporate media\" and others, DeSantis said: \"At the end of the day, I would just tell people to go check out the scoreboard from last Tuesday night.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nLiz Cheney trolls fellow Republican Kari Lake\n\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., seemingly trolled defeated Arizona gubernatorial Republican nominee Kari Lake in a tweet on Monday night.\n\nCheney quote-tweeted an Oct. 28 tweet from Lake, in which Lake sarcastically thanked Cheney for encouraging Arizona voters to not support her.\n\n“Your recent television ad urging Arizonans not to vote for me is doing just the opposite,” Lake taunted.\n\nYet, Cheney appeared to get the last laugh after Democrat Katie Hobbs defeated Lake in the Arizona governor’s race. “You’re welcome, @KariLake,” Cheney responded to Lake in a tweet.\n\n– Mabinty Quarshie\n\nTrump plans to announce 2024 presidential campaign plans at 9 p.m.\n\nWASHINGTON – Donald Trump is expected to announce plans to seek the presidency again in 2024 during a 9 p.m. event that comes a week after Republican election losses scrambled the emerging GOP nomination race and undercut the ex-president's status as party leader.\n\nMany Republicans blamed Trump for the GOP's poor showing in the 2002 midterms, and are urging party members to look for a new candidate.

Doug Jones' seat.\n\nThe announcement, widely-expected in Montgomery political circles, forces existing GOP campaigns to account for Moore's base-driven politics and high name recognition, which usually spot him a significant portion of the GOP electorate.\n\nBut lingering allegations of harassment and inappropriate behavior with women, as well as a divisiveness that predated those accusations, could hinder him as it did in his run against Jones in 2017, a fact his Republican opponents will strive to highlight in the months ahead.\n\nFrom the president:Donald Trump to Roy Moore: Don't run for Senate seat in Alabama again\n\nU.S. Rep. Bradley Byrne of Mobile; Rep. Arnold Mooney of Indian Springs and former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville are running for the Republican nomination. Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, also a Republican, plans to announce his plans next week.\n\nMoore goes into the race still facing accusations from nine women that he assaulted, harassed or acted inappropriately with them, mostly during his time as an assistant district attorney in Etowah County from 1977 to 1982. Moore denies the allegations. The women have stuck to their stories. Leigh Corfman, who alleges that Moore had sexual contact with her when she was 14 and he was 32, has sued Moore for defamation. The case is pending in Montgomery Circuit Court.\n\nAn email seeking comment was sent to Corfman’s attorney on Wednesday.\n\nThe former chief justice has unusually high name recognition for a politician but remains a polarizing figure. A survey of Republican voters released in April by Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy found Moore had a plurality of voters (27 percent) favoring him.\n\n\"He will certainly be one of the top two or three candidates,\" said Lance Hyche, a Republican consultant who is not currently working for any Senate campaign. \"He’s historically had 30 to 35 percent of the vote, whatever he runs for. I see no reason for his base of support to wane in this race.\"\n\nBut in that same poll, Moore also had a 29 percent unfavorability rating, the highest of candidates tested.\n\nMoore cruised to victory in the Republican primaries for the U.S. Senate in the late summer and early fall of 2017. But he mounted a lackluster campaign for Senate before the Washington Post first reported on the allegations, and virtually disappeared from the trail afterward. Jones, riding a wave of Democratic enthusiasm, easily outraised him and ran a center campaign aimed at appealing to suburban voters. In the end, high turnout for Jones in Democratic strongholds and the flipping of Lee and Tuscaloosa counties helped secure his win on Dec. 12, 2017. Moore's strongest counties generally had lower turnout than Jones'\n\nPrevious election:Enthusiastic Democratic voters delivered Doug Jones a victory\n\n\"I think a lot of people resent Moore and his antics,\" said David Mowery, a political consultant based in Montgomery who helped run Jefferson County Circuit Judge Bob Vance's campaign against Moore in 2012. \"I think you have to highlight that. If you’re Merrill, you want to say 'I’m all those things without the crazy.' If you’re Byrne, you want to say ‘(Moore’s) too risky. We can’t a flyer on that.'”\n\nBefore his 2017 loss, Moore had a tendency to underperform the Republican ticket. In his race for chief justice in 2012, Moore got just 52 percent of the vote in a year when Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got nearly 61 percent.\n\nHigh turnout tends to dampen Moore’s performance at the ballot box. Moore in 2006 lost the Republican gubernatorial nomination to then-Gov. Bob Riley. A little over 38 percent of voters cast ballots in that primary, with about half the votes cast on the Republican side. In 2010, Moore finished fourth in a seven-person Republican gubernatorial field, where total turnout was 32 percent, with about 61 percent of ballots cast going to the Republican.\n\nBy contrast, Moore won two low turnout races in the 2017 Republican race for U.S. Senate. Just 18 percent of voters cast ballots in August primary that year, while just 15 percent voted in the runoff that September. About 41 percent voted in the December Senate election, narrowly won by Jones.\n\nMoore's divisiveness would probably give Jones his best shot at re-election, but the incumbent senator -- the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama in 25 years -- faces an uphill struggle, as long as Donald Trump remains popular in Alabama. Zac McCrary, a Democratic pollster with Anzalone Liszt Grove in Montgomery, said the presidential electorate could bring out more of the African-American and youth voters who would tend to support Democrats.\n\n\"Doug Jones is the underdog, but he was the underdog in the special election as well, and he probably relishes the role of underdog,\" he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/20"}]}

The Alabama Finance Department confirmed that the bond sale, which had been approved last month, was finalized. The deal closure comes after criminal justice reform activists had strived for more than a year to disrupt the sale. But legal wrangling over the project is continuing through ongoing litigation. Gov. Kay Ivey and lawmakers approved the construction as a solution to Alabama’s ongoing prison woes. Critics of the plan argue that the state is ignoring the bigger issues – prison staffing levels and leadership – to focus on building projects. “The construction of new and modern correctional facilities is absolutely and undeniably necessary to support the safety of both inmates and staff, to improve mental health care, to provide space for vocational and rehabilitative programs, and ultimately to protect public safety,” Alabama officials said in a statement. “No eleventh-hour lawsuits by inmates or activists will halt these efforts, and the state intends to move to dismiss the lawsuits and to vigorously defend against the claims as being without merit.” Activists had tried to discourage the deal, calling it a cruel investment in mass incarceration.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some rain helped firefighters battling a wildfire that prompted evacuations. About a half-inch fell into early Monday, allowing crews to build more fire breaks to help control the wildfire started by lightning June 21. “It’s not really like a season-ending type of rain; it’s more like a slowing,” said Mark Enty, a spokesperson for a state firefighting team. The fire has been burning near the community of Anderson. Evacuation orders were place for all properties accessed by roads, trails or driveways on the west side of the Parks Highway from mileposts 269 to 275. The city of Anderson, located about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, is not under an evacuation order. At least one home has been confirmed to have been lost, and Enty said Denali Borough officials will make an official assessment of other structures. The fire was estimated to be 110 square miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Evictions in the greater Phoenix area have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The latest data from the Maricopa County Justice Court shows that landlords filed 5,792 evictions in June, compared with 5,669 in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums that slowed lockouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended. June also saw the highest number of monthly eviction filings since the pandemic began in spring 2020. A court spokesman emphasized that applications for rental assistance are still being accepted and encouraged tenants in need to apply.\n\nArkansas\n\nParagould: Jimmie Lou Fisher, who served as Arkansas’ state treasurer for more than two decades and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has died, a funeral home said. She was 80. Fisher died Monday at Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould, Mitchell Funeral Home said. A cause of death was not released. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton appointed Fisher as state auditor in 1979. She later served as treasurer from 1981 to 2002. “I will always remember that early October morning in 1991, when Jimmie Lou introduced me as I kicked off my presidential campaign on the steps of the Old State House,” Clinton said in a statement Tuesday. “As always, she was enthusiastic, caring and kind, saying just the words we all needed to hear.” He added: “She loved Arkansas and Arkansas loved her back. And she did a fine job as state treasurer.” Fisher ran for governor in 2002 and lost to Republican Mike Huckabee, capturing 47% of the vote. “She loved politics and was a faithful and fierce warrior for her party throughout her adult life,” Huckabee said Tuesday. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday in Paragould.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill, who was ordered to pay attorneys’ fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists she sued after the publication of intimate photos without her consent, has filed for bankruptcy protection. If successful, the move could allow Hill to avoid paying about $220,000 in fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Democrat who briefly represented a district north of Los Angeles had accused multiple parties in a revenge-porn lawsuit of violating the law by publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The lawsuit was thrown out, and a judge later rendered the financial judgments. Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She resigned in 2019 after the publication of the photos and amid a House ethics probe into allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her congressional staffers, which she denied. Hill, 34, gained national attention in 2018 when she was elected to Congress in a district long under Republican control. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who allegedly made a threatening phone call against the state’s top elections official has been charged with retaliating against an elected official. Kirk Wertz, 52, was arrested June 6 in suburban Denver over the June 30 phone call to the office of Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold after investigators tracked his cellphone moving from Goodland, Kansas, to Colorado, according to a court document. Authorities have not revealed what the alleged threat was. His alleged statements to the person who answered the phone at Griswold’s office and to a state trooper who called the number back later were redacted from a document explaining why he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney’s Office, Carolyn Tyler, confirmed that Wertz had been charged but declined to elaborate beyond what was included in the document. Wertz was being held in jail Friday after making his first appearance in court Thursday. There was no attorney listed as representing him yet in court records. In a statement, Griswold thanked law enforcement for taking action against Wertz and said threats would not deter her from carrying out her election duties. “The wave of violent threats directed at election officials and workers across the county is extremely concerning,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The wife of a former state lawmaker pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with her role in the alleged theft of more than $600,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven. Lauren DiMassa, one of several people including her husband who were arrested in the investigation, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Sentencing has not been scheduled. She remains free on bail. Federal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa, formerly known as Lauren Knox, nearly $148,000 for services she never provided to the city. She and her husband were accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services including youth violence prevention, but instead they used the money for their own benefit, prosecutors said. DiMassa’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that DiMassa turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband. O’Reilly declined to comment after the hearing. DiMassa’s husband is former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council. He resigned from both positions after his arrest in October. He has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the First State saw a slight decline in fatalities in 2020, a report released Tuesday still ranks Delaware among the deadliest states for pedestrians. Smart Growth America’s Dangerous by Design 2022 report analyzed federal crash and fatality data from 2016 to 2020 – the latest statistics publicly available – finding Delaware’s pedestrian fatalities declined slightly during the pandemic, averaging 2.89 deaths per 100,000 people from 2016-20. That represented a 0.42 decline in deaths per 100,000 people from 2016 to 2019, but long-term comparisons between rates from 2011-15 and 2016-20 show little change, keeping Delaware the fifth most dangerous state for pedestrians, the report shows. New Mexico was at the top with 3.76 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people annually, followed by Florida with 3.22 deaths, South Carolina with 3.19 deaths and Arizona with 2.98 deaths, according to the report. Delaware has consistently ranked among the deadliest states for pedestrian safety, and over the past decade, the number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities on the state’s roadways has nearly doubled. The First State saw non-motorized fatalities increase from 21 in 2009 to 28 in 2020, according to the latest statistics available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. residents can now preregister for monkeypox vaccination appointments, WUSA-TV reports, citing a Tuesday announcement by DC Health. Once appointments become available, starting Thursday, people who preregistered will receive an email invitation to make an appointment. Residents will then have 48 hours to claim their appointment. About 3,000 appointments are expected to become available this week. Currently, eligibility for the vaccination is limited to adults in certain sexual circumstances that would increase their risk, based on where the virus has been circulating most heavily in the U.S. But residents who do not meet the current vaccine eligibility criteria are still encouraged to preregister. The monkeypox vaccinations are free and based on availability. At the appointment, confirmation of an appointment and proof of residency will be required.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: U.S. immigration officials say 25 Cuban migrants landed in South Florida on Tuesday – the latest arrival amid a mass migration from the island to escape political and economic troubles. The group was seen sitting off the side of the road by a beachside park in Key Biscayne in the early morning and included women and a few children, who were all taken into custody. Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said via Twitter it was a smuggling incident that was being investigated. Between last October and May, Customs and Border Protection officials have found and detained about 1,000 Cubans arriving in Florida. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had stopped more than 3,000 Cubans at sea since last October. The majority of Cubans continue to migrate by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 140,000 arriving since last October – a number that exceeds the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when more than 124,700 Cubans came to the U.S. Cuba is seeing its worst economic crisis in decades due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tightening of U.S. sanctions. Last summer, people staged massive protests, which ended in hundreds of arrests, according to nongovernmental groups.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: A man became trapped while trying to crawl down through a vent from a strip mall roof into a pizza restaurant Tuesday, forcing firefighters to slice open the vent to free him, police said. The man was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unclear. Police told local news outlets that emergency responders cut open the vent where it extended upward from a pizza oven at a Little Caesars outlet in suburban Lithonia, about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Brittany Davis, a U.S. Army recruiter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she could hear the man yelling for help when she arrived for work at a neighboring recruiting office. “I looked on the roof but couldn’t see anybody,” Davis said. She called 911. Davis said a Little Caesars employee told her he could hear the man’s voice coming from inside the oven. Davis said she went inside the pizza restaurant and spoke to the man, who reported he was in pain and having a panic attack. “I’m not sure what time the restaurant closes at night, but the oven still gives off heat after they close, I imagine,” DeKalb County Fire Cpt. Jason Daniels told WXIA-TV. “For him to get down into the pipe … he had to do it in a certain window of time when the oven was cool enough, and obviously nobody was there.” The man walked to an ambulance shortly after being removed and was taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or announce any criminal charges.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was given new land Tuesday in a deal that will protect and manage a pristine white sand beach and ocean bay area that is home to endangered and endemic species and to rare, culturally significant Native Hawaiian artifacts. Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit land preservation group, transferred its ownership of Pohue Bay and surrounding land to the National Park Service. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has the world’s largest and most active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Most of the coastline where the bay is located is made of ancient lava flows, black rock and sea cliffs that dart out into the ocean. Pohue Bay, a rare and idyllic oasis in an otherwise rugged landscape, is home to endangered hawksbill sea turtles, green sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other species found only in Hawaii. The area houses anchialine ponds – landlocked pools with a mix of fresh and salt water – where rare Hawaiian red shrimp called ʻōpaeʻula live. The area is also culturally significant because it has remains of ancient Hawaiian villages, petroglyphs, burial sites and the largest known abrader tool quarry in the state, according to the Trust for Public Lands. Abraders are ancient tools used for sanding, smoothing and grinding.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lame-duck Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has given a big pay boost to an administrative assistant who is also a top state Republican Party official in a move that could hinder the ability of the next lieutenant governor by significantly depleting the office’s budget before January’s power transition. In an email Monday, McGeachin informed the Idaho Division of Financial Management that Machele Hamilton would go from part time to full time and jump from $20,000 to $77,000 annually. Her hourly pay is an increase from $20 an hour to about $37 an hour. Her title in the new role is director of strategy and constituent services. She is also the first vice-chair of the Idaho Republican Party. Hamilton is making about $30,000 more than McGeachin’s former chief of staff, Jordan Watters, who resigned in March when McGeachin couldn’t stay within last year’s budget. It’s not clear why Hamilton is being paid so much more than Watters, whose chief of staff duties would likely have included everything in the title Hamilton was given. Hamilton answered the phone for McGeachin’s office Tuesday afternoon but said McGeachin wasn’t available. Hamilton declined to comment about her employment in the office, and McGeachin didn’t respond to a message left with Hamilton by the Associated Press concerning Hamilton’s employment.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A Wisconsin doctor has purchased two clinical buildings in northern Illinois where he plans to offer abortion pills as early as Friday at one location and surgical abortions within six months at the other site. The move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last month. That led abortion providers in Wisconsin to stop the procedures while the courts determine whether the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions stands. Abortion remains legal in Illinois, making it a likely draw for residents of many other states in the Midwest and even the South. Dr. Dennis Christensen said he’s part of a group trying to revive abortion services in Rockford, in part to accommodate Wisconsin patients. Christensen is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has provided abortions in Madison and Milwaukee and is now mostly retired, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He recently purchased a former acupuncture office for $75,000 and the former Animal Emergency Clinic of Rockford for $350,000, according to the Winnebago County records. The newly formed Rockford Family Planning Foundation is fundraising and is preparing the second site for surgical abortions, birth control and related care. “We feel like it’s absolutely essential for us to get open as quickly as possible,” said Jeanne Bissell, the group’s president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Students across the state had small improvements in their English and math scores, with standardized test results released Wednesday indicating a tentative bright spot following years of pandemic-disrupted learning. Results for the spring 2022 ILEARN exam from the Indiana Department of Education show the statewide percentage of students meeting their grade expectations for math climbing to 39.4% from 2021’s 36.9%. The English proficiency levels rose to 41.2%, up from last year’s 40.5%. ILEARN was first implemented in 2019 to replace the state’s ISTEP exam for students from third to eighth grade. The state did not test students in 2020 because of COVID-19-related school shutdowns. Students with passing scores remain about 7 or 8 percentage points below 2019’s pre-pandemic pass rates. The 2022 report also says most grades saw slight increases in passing scores, with the exception of sixth and eighth graders, who saw minor decreases in English scores. All grade levels’ math proficiency increased at least 2 percentage points since 2021. Charity Flores, chief academic officer at the Department of Education, presented the findings to the Board of Education on Wednesday. This year marks the second year of recovery, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds declined Tuesday to say whether she would get behind a so-called red flag law in Iowa after a new bipartisan federal gun safety law would offer funding to states that enact them. Reynolds, a Republican, said she wouldn’t rule it out and plans to “take a look at everything.” But she also said that she believes red flag laws have not stopped some shootings in other states and that Iowa needs to have a “balance” that recognizes the rights of gun owners as it moves forward. “When we focus on one solution to the issues that we see with active shooters, we tend to, I think, not think about what other solutions are,” she said. “And we eliminate potential things that we can do right away.” Extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws, allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia currently have red flag laws in place. Many of those states are clustered in regions of the U.S. largely governed by Democrats, but some states run by Republicans such as Florida and Indiana also have them. Such laws have gained some bipartisan support, including among U.S. lawmakers as 29 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the federal gun safety law in late June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas State Board of Education is looking to veteran teachers to help mitigate staff shortages this fall. The board on Tuesday passed a measure giving any retired educator who previously held a Kansas teaching license an easier pathway back into the classroom during the 2022-23 school year. The new transitional license option, intended for retired educators whose prior teaching credentials have been lapsed for at least six months, streamlines the process and eliminates application fees and professional development requirements needed for typical license renewals. Applicants will still have to pay $50 for a background check, since the state education department outsources that work. Over the past five years, teacher retirements ebbed, but they ticked back up in the past five years, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. In 2020, the agency recorded 785 educators as having retired, but in 2022, KSDE has reported a record-high 986 teacher retirements, said Shane Carter, director of teacher licensure. However, the department in the past few years has also seen a surge in the number of retired teachers who have renewed their teaching license, Carter said, more than doubling from 368 retired teacher renewals in 2020 to 766 in 2022.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A medical marijuana advisory team formed by Gov. Andy Beshear will hold a town hall on the issue Thursday evening in northern Kentucky. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee is traveling around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office. The next town hall is set for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Northern Kentucky University’s student union ballroom in Highland Heights, a statement from the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet said. Other meetings are set for Tuesday at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in Frankfort and July 25 at Hopkinsville Community College. The first meeting was held July 6 in Pikeville. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Secretary Ray Perry serve as co-chairs of the 17-member panel. It includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State authorities have once again been blocked from enforcing a near-total ban on abortion, this time under a judge’s order released Tuesday by a state court in Baton Rouge. Judge Donald Johnson’s order halts enforcement temporarily while lawyers for a north Louisiana clinic and other supporters of abortion rights pursue a lawsuit challenging the legislation. Johnson set a hearing for next Monday. State Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized the ruling in a series of posts on Twitter. “To have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing,” Landry wrote in one post. “The rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.” Kathaleen Pittman, director of the north Louisiana clinic that was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, expressed relief in a phone interview. Pittman said the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport is ready to resume counseling and abortions. Louisiana’s two other clinics are in the capital, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. “We look forward to arguing for a preliminary injunction before Judge Johnson next Monday and, in the meantime, we take solace in the fact that crucial healthcare for women has been restored in the state of Louisiana,” Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal circuit court has reinstated a ban on lobster fishing gear in a nearly 1,000-square-mile area off New England to try to protect endangered whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations last year that prohibited lobster fishing with vertical buoy lines in part of the fall and winter in the area, which is in federal waters off Maine’s coast. The ruling was intended to prevent North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340, from becoming entangled in the lines. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston vacated that ruling Tuesday. The circuit court sent the case back to the district court level but noted in its ruling that it does not think the lobster fishing groups that sued to stop the regulations are likely to succeed because Congress has clearly instructed the fisheries service to protect the whales. “Although this does not mean the balance will always come out on the side of an endangered marine mammal, it does leave plaintiffs beating against the tide, with no more success than they had before,” the court ruled.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Commercial and recreational fishermen woke up Sunday to new mako shark regulations from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to boost the number of the migratory predator. Michael Luisi, acting director of the department’s Fishing and Boating Services, said a zero retention limit was established for shortfin mako sharks in both commercial and recreational fishing. Prior to that, a very limited number of the species could be retained. Luisi said penalties for doing so would include “severe and hefty” fines for violators. “Most shark fishermen are going to be up on the regulations because they have to just go fishing,” said Mark Sampson, captain of the charter boat Fish Finder, based in Ocean City. “But your average guy that goes out to catch tuna or black sea bass might not have taken the time to learn shark regulations. So if he accidently catches one on his line, he won’t know if it’s a keeper or not. Those anglers are the ones that are the most frustrated with regulations.” After 40 years of being at the helm of a charter boat, Sampson remains busy with clients that do not always plan on coming back with a shark. For some, the experience is enough. The average season for shark fishing runs from mid-May to October, with mako sharks caught to mid-June.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A family’s beloved pet cat that’s been dodging airport personnel, airline employees and animal experts since escaping from a pet carrier at Logan International Airport about three weeks ago was finally caught Wednesday. “Whether out of fatigue or hunger we’ll never know, but this morning she finally let herself be caught,” an airport spokesperson said in a statement. The cat, named Rowdy, was given a health check and will be returned to her family. “I’m kind of in disbelief,” said her owner, Patty Sahli. “I thought, ‘What are the odds we’re actually going to get her back?’ But I got a call this morning, and I am just so shocked.” Rowdy’s time on the lam began June 24, as Sahli and her husband, Rich, returned to the U.S. from 15 years in Germany with the Army. When their Lufthansa flight landed, the 4-year-old black cat with green eyes escaped her cage, in pursuit of some birds. Soon Rowdy herself was on the receiving end of a chase, as her getaway set off a massive search involving airport and Lufthansa personnel, construction workers, and animal welfare advocates, as well as the use of wildlife cameras and safe-release traps. Despite numerous sightings, Rowdy always eluded her pursuers – but now, a little calm has been restored. “It was such a community effort,” Sahli said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort to lock certain voting rights into the Michigan Constitution has taken a major step toward the fall ballot, eclipsing a rival campaign led by Republicans to limit absentee voting and add other restrictions. Promote the Vote, a coalition of 27 groups, submitted nearly 670,000 signatures Monday. While the signatures still must be validated by election officials, the petitions contain about 245,000 more names than necessary to qualify for the Nov. 8 election. The ballot question would expand voter rights by allowing nine days of in-person early voting, state-funded absentee ballot postage and drop boxes in every community. Promote the Vote is the same coalition that helped pass no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration in 2018. Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, said the campaign “observed the 2020 election, and even the 2018 election, and we see where there could be improvements.” In addition to increased access to early voting, the constitutional amendment would require 24-hour absentee ballot drop boxes in every community. Voters could also join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. And it would require election audits to be conducted in public by state and county officials and certified based only on the official records of votes cast. Some portions are already in Michigan law, but the state has seen attempts at “manipulating the language in that law, and we want to make sure we close those loopholes,” Spencer said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local governments in the state are trying to find creative solutions to managing the cost of fueling their fleets of vehicles as gas prices remain high. With gas prices recently near $5 a gallon in the Twin Cities, municipal leaders are looking to keep police squad cars, fire engines, dump trucks and park equipment fueled, yet stay on budget. The city of Buffalo is urging carpooling and checking tire pressure on its vehicles to stretch a tank of gas. “We’re projecting we will be coming in over our fuel budget,” said Taylor Gronau, Buffalo’s assistant city administrator. “However, a lot of those trips are necessary and needed.” Several communities are trying to add more electric and hybrid vehicles to their fleets – only to find huge backlogs, the Star Tribune reports. Earlier this summer, Minneapolis started a program that gave home inspectors the option of taking e-bikes to job sites. It saved wear and tear on the vehicle fleet and cut the city’s gas consumption. Several other city agencies, including IT and public works staff, are also looking into e-bikes. While dozens of local governments are under state fuel contacts, which cover a majority of fuel purchases in bulk and at a fixed rate, many other communities don’t participate, including Buffalo, which relies on retail gas stations to fuel its fleet.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl River County: A volunteer fire department lost the use of three trucks when its own station went up in flames. WLOX TV reports the fire happened Monday night at the Nicholson Volunteer Fire Department station. Nicholson is a community in Pearl River County, near the Gulf Coast and the Louisiana state line. Five neighboring firefighting agencies assisted in fighting the blaze. Three trucks were heavily damaged, according to the TV station. And a county press release said several other pieces of key firefighting equipment were destroyed in the fire. Former Nicholson fire Chief Bobby Robbins estimated the damage at $1 million and said it could take roughly 100 days to have the equipment replaced. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Robbins said the trucks were donated by Deep South, a company from which the team is now considering renting. The Pearl River County Fire Marshal said officials are working with other agencies in the meantime to borrow equipment. Authorities must determine how the fire started as well as how to provide immediate protection in Nicholson without the fire trucks, equipment and a usable firehouse.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Developers announced plans Monday to expand the capacity of a controversial wind power transmission line so much that it would match that of four new nuclear power plants. Invenergy Transmission, the Chicago-based company attempting to build the Grain Belt Express, now says the project will be able to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power, about 25% more than originally planned, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Investment in the project, which would stretch about 800 miles from Kansas to Indiana on a route crossing Missouri and Illinois, also would soar to about $7 billion, Invenergy said. Various municipal utilities in Missouri have long intended to buy power from the project, but now five times as much electricity will be delivered to the state – rising from 500 to 2,500 megawatts, compared to earlier plans. The project will help unlock $7.5 billion in energy cost savings in Missouri and Illinois, according to its developers. The Grain Belt Express has the support of several area advocacy groups, including the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and the Associated Industries of Missouri. But some farmers who don’t want high-power transmission lines on their land have fought the project.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said. The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933. The alpine highway also opened July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35-per-vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway. The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Supporters of the late Malcolm X are making a new push to get him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The Omaha native was nominated 15 years ago but rejected amid concerns of controversy, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A Malcolm X Memorial Foundation board member submitted a nomination for the next class of honorees – selected every five years – for the human rights activist, who was born as Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965. JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike called him “one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history,” according to the World-Herald, and putting him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame would push “the rest of the state to know about the true civil rights history of Omaha.” Malcolm X is one of eight Nebraskans nominated this year. New members may only be named at least 35 years after their deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno is expecting fall enrollment to match numbers from a year ago – still down from pre-pandemic levels, when the campus saw record enrollment of 21,000 in the fall of 2019. “We are all least even where we were last year,” UNR President Brian Sandoval said. At UNR, fall 2020 enrollment, including non-degree-seeking students, was 19,961. It climbed to 20,129 in fall 2021. The state’s seven colleges – including Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – have all felt the effects of closing campuses and moving classes online. Enrollment systemwide topped 112,427 in the fall of 2019, according to data from the Nevada System of Higher Education. In 2021, enrollment was 106,259. Spring 2022 enrollment was estimated at 95,446 across the seven institutions. Among the factors affecting enrollment, Sandoval said, are the hardships students experienced from COVID-19, travel restrictions including for foreign students, and fewer Californians enrolling as the neighboring state has dramatically increased its admissions. “Students are challenged on a lot of levels,” Sandoval said, adding that housing prices and inflation are also affecting how many can afford higher education.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge has consolidated hundreds of lawsuits alleging physical and sexual abuse at the state’s youth detention center, more than two years after the first case was filed. David Meehan sued the state, the youth center, agencies that oversee it and multiple former employees in January 2020, alleging he endured near-daily rapes and beatings at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the 1990s. At the time, he was one of about three dozen men and women who had come forward, but since then, about 450 have filed lawsuits alleging abuse by 150 staffers over six decades. The civil litigation has largely been on hold since 11 former youth workers were arrested last year, but a judge last week kicked it into high gear with an order setting out the consolidation process. While consolidation brings the “the risk of cookie-cutter dispositions,” proceeding with individual cases would present a “backbreaking clerical burden” for the court, said Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Andrew Schulman. The state is expected to produce more than 3 million pages of documents in the initial discovery phase. Discovery likely will take several months, and groups of cases will be combined for joint trials, lawyers said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new “strike force” within the state attorney general’s office will aim to enforce New Jersey laws that protect the right to an abortion, working to make sure that patient confidentiality and personal health information are secure and that patients and providers are not threatened or intimidated by protesters. The Reproductive Rights Task Force announced Monday by acting Attorney General Matt Platkin is intended to ensure the full implementation of laws that give New Jersey some of the strongest protections for abortion rights in the United States. As other states ban or severely restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the 49-year constitutional right to an abortion in the United States, New Jersey is expected to become a haven for people from those states who are seeking the procedures. Two laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on July 1 bar the extradition of people who receive or perform an abortion in New Jersey to those states that restrict or criminalize the procedure and prohibit public agencies from aiding investigations conducted by those states into abortions provided in the Garden State. The new group of attorneys and law enforcement officers within New Jersey’s Department of Law and Public Safety “will ensure that these laws are enforced to the full extent possible, and that we use every available resource to protect access to abortion care in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Physicians and researchers are urging state lawmakers to allow the use of psychedelic mushrooms in mental health therapy aimed at overcoming depression, anxiety, psychological trauma and alcoholism. A legislative panel on Tuesday listened to advocates who hope to broaden the scope of medical treatment and research assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic active ingredient in certain mushrooms. Oregon is so far the only state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Recent studies indicate psilocybin could be useful in the treatment of major depression, including mental suffering among terminally ill patients, and for substance abuse including alcoholism, with low risks of addiction or overdose under medical supervision. Physician Lawrence Leeman, a medicine professor at the University of New Mexico, urged legislators to move forward without waiting for federal decriminalization or regulatory approval to expand responsible therapies using doses of psilocybin. Leeman and other advocates outlined emerging psilocybin protocols, involving six-hour supervised sessions and extensive discussions about the experience in subsequent counseling. He warned legislators that public interest is spawning illicit, underground experimentation without safeguards.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City, one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive. City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as the vaccine supply increases. U.S. infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. “After COVID, this should have been easy,” said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday. “I kept refreshing and refreshing. … I was frustrated.” Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. “It’s going to haunt me,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Local Republicans are planning a 30-day raffle of guns and ammunition, a move that’s drawing criticism in light of recent mass shootings across the U.S. The Forsyth County Republican Party will offer semi-automatic weapons, among other guns, in the raffle, the Winston-Salem Journal reports. Organizer Vernon Robinson said each raffle ticket will bear a three-digit number the purchaser can check each day against one of the games in the North Carolina Education Lottery from Sept. 9 through Oct. 8 to determine the winner. “The biggest problem with raffles is that the buyers can’t be sure the folks who are conducting it are playing it straight with the numbers,” Robinson said. “The way we solve that problem is to use the N.C. Education Lottery’s daily Pick 3 numbers.” A lottery spokesman said the agency does not know of any law that prevents other groups from using publicly released drawing numbers to decide their own raffles. Robinson said he hopes the fundraiser will net the party some $9,000 to $10,000 to “beat Democrats.” “The only people who are upset about gun raffles are people who are hostile to guns and gun owners,” he said. Kevin Farmer, chairman of the Forsyth County Democratic Party, said the move was “disappointing but, given the extremist nature of the Republican Party, not at all surprising.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Tuesday rejected calls to release body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Fargo and said he will personally oversee the case himself. Wrigley’s announcement came a day after family members and their supporters demanded to see video in the death of 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown. About 50 people gathered Monday evening outside Fargo City Hall in a protest organized by a Native American group. Wrigley said the footage will be made public once all the proceedings are complete. “As a matter of course, law enforcement does not release evidence to the media for public consumption,” he said, noting there are only limited exceptions. Officer Adam O’Brien, an 11-year veteran of the department, shot Netterville on Friday after police responded to a report of people slumped over in a van. A police report said when officers arrived and tried to make contact with the occupants, the vehicle began to travel directly toward officers, and O’Brien fired. Netterville was driving the van, which police said had been reported stolen. Another man was arrested at the scene after he reportedly ignored commands of officers and was found to have methamphetamine. A third person who fled the scene was apprehended Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Division of Police will refer for internal review only one of 24 alleged misconduct cases during the 2020 racial injustice protests presented by an investigative team, police said Tuesday. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement that she would only be referring one sergeant to the Internal Affairs Bureau for an administrative investigation. The referrals came after an investigation by retired FBI agent Richard Wozniak and Columbus Special Prosecutor Kathleen Garber, who were tasked in 2020 with looking into alleged criminal misconduct by officers during protests in May and June following the murder of George Floyd Jr. by then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the statement, Bryant said she “immediately put together a team” to see which, if any, of the cases could be investigated further. Bryant noted that any administrative investigation must also comply with the contract with Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, which mandates that all investigations occur within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint. Only one case fell within the 90-day time frame because the clock was stopped while the sergeant’s conduct was under a criminal investigation, Bryant said in the statement. The criminal investigation concluded May 27.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: People who believe they are descendants of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can now provide genetic material to help scientists when they begin trying to identify remains of possible victims. Danny Hellwig, laboratory director with Intermountain Forensics, said Wednesday that researchers are not ready to begin trying to match DNA for identification, but an outpouring of requests from local residents on how to provide genetic material led them to begin the process of accepting donations. “That’s what prompted this,” Hellwig said. “We didn’t expect the amount of support and willingness to help … people have jumped out of the woodwork” to offer their DNA for testing. Black people who had ancestors in Tulsa in 1921 are sought, Hellwig said. “What we need is to populate these databases with family lines” of direct descendants, making identifications of the remains possible within days, Hellwig said. “If we’re only matched with very distant relatives, it can take much longer,” with previous efforts to make such matches taking four years or more, he said. The Salt Lake City nonprofit foundation is examining 14 sets of remains removed from a Tulsa cemetery a year ago and has said at least two of the remains contains enough usable DNA for testing for possible identification.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson’s trial started this week on one count of felony riot in connection with a brawl outside a Portland bar in 2019. Jury selection began Monday and is scheduled to continue through Thursday, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Prosecutors allege Gibson instigated a street fight between Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists May 1, 2019, at the now-closed bar Cider Riot. In an arrest warrant affidavit, Deputy District Attorney Brad Kalbaugh said video of the brawl shows Gibson and his two co-defendants “taunting and physically threatening members of the Antifa group in an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical altercation.” Three other brawl participants with the Patriot Prayer group, Chris Ponte, Ian Kramer and Matthew Cooper, were indicted and pleaded guilty. Kramer, who knocked a woman unconscious and fractured her vertebrae with a baton, pleaded guilty to riot, assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and five years of probation. Ponte, who prosecutors said threw a rock and hurt a woman, pleaded guilty to a riot charge in a plea deal. He was sentenced to three years probation and 10 days in jail. Cooper pleaded guilty to riot and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor tweeted he had “big news” Tuesday, announcing the state budget passed in recent days includes funding for three new state parks. Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Beth Rementer, subsequently said the park sites haven’t been chosen, but work to identify and purchase the land is underway by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The state’s 2022-23 spending plan includes $56 million to add the new state parks to what is currently a 121-park system. The three will be the first new state parks in Pennsylvania since 2005, not counting Washington Crossing, which was transferred from the state Historical and Museum Commission. The money will also help develop the state’s first park for the use of all-terrain vehicles and similar motorized recreational vehicles. “Our beautiful state parks are among the finest in the nation,” Wolf tweeted. “I’m proud that we secured funding in this year’s budget to make this investment in our park system.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman who authorities say pretended to be a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer to fraudulently collect about $250,000 in veterans benefits and charitable contributions has agreed to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 31, of East Greenwich, signed an agreement in U.S. District Court in Providence under which she will admit to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. She has also agreed to pay more than $82,000 in restitution. She faces more than 20 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of sentencing guidelines, according to court documents. Cavanaugh’s attorney, Kensley Barrett, said Tuesday that while he appreciates the interest that the case has garnered, he has no comment at this time. There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military, according to authorities. However, she did work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence. Through her job, she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer for disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh said Tuesday that investigators have indicated they intend to pursue murder charges against him for the deaths of his wife and son, who were fatally shot outside their home more than a year ago. Lawyer Jim Griffin said in a statement that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division told Murdaugh family members they plan to seek indictments from a grand jury later this week. “We won’t have any comment until charges are actually brought against Alex,” Griffin said. Officials with both state police and the attorney general’s office would not comment on whether authorities were pursuing the indictments, which were first reported by news and opinion website FITSNews. Murdaugh already faces dozens of criminal charges that have piled up in the months since his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed. But until now he has not been charged in connection with their deaths; he’s repeatedly denied any role in those killings. The deaths led to at least a half-dozen investigations into Murdaugh and his finances resulting in charges that he stole $8.5 million from people who hired him and that he lied to police in saying he was shot by a stranger on a roadside when – officials say – he really asked a friend to kill him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Citizens who called the National Weather Service concerned about some “silvery objects” in the sky around the city this week prompted the agency to tweet that the objects were not aliens but rather test balloons launched by a South Dakota aerospace subsidiary. “Sorry, not aliens,” the NWS tweeted in response to the calls it received. The high-altitude balloons were launched by Raven Aerostar, a subsidiary of Raven Industries. “As a South Dakota company and the world leader in stratospheric balloon technology, our team conducts stratospheric balloon flights throughout the year, and many of them are launched from our dedicated hangar near Baltic,” Aerostar president Jim Nelson said. “Two of our Thunderhead Balloon Systems are currently over Sioux Falls.” The balloons, which look like hot air balloons, operate miles above the surface of the earth. Once a balloon reaches the stratosphere, it changes from a teardrop to a pumpkin shape, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Aerostar said the balloons have a variety of uses, including monitoring wildfires, expanding cellular networks and military reconnaissance. They navigate by autonomously changing altitude to take advantage of wind currents in the atmosphere.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is increasing its investment by $1.4 billion for a strategic plan that includes programs advancing the study and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases, the hospital said Wednesday. The additional funding is part of a six-year expansion plan that launched last year, and it will raise the six-year operating and capital budget to $12.9 billion, the Memphis-based hospital said in a news release. New funding will affect scientific operations, clinical care, global medicine and infrastructure. The number of new jobs will increase from from 1,400 to 2,300, while funds for construction, renovation and capital needs will rise from from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the hospital said. As part of the expansion plan, more investment will be seen in areas including structural biology, advanced microscopy, data sciences, global childhood cancer care, and collaborative projects involving St. Jude and scientists across the U.S. and the world, the hospital said. Additional funds also will be used on construction projects including Domino’s Village, a 140-unit housing facility; the Family Commons, a treatment-free zone for patients and their families to rest and enjoy themselves; and two 15-story towers dedicated to patient care and clinical research, St. Jude said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas student leaders are advocating for campus officials to “protect reproductive rights” and take action in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month and the state’s ban on abortions. A statement released by the student-run UT Coalition for Reproductive Justice and Rights on Tuesday includes a series of demands, including calling for UT leadership to expand sex education and reproductive health care resources, support adding an emergency contraceptive vending machine on campus, and advocate for reproductive health care access. “We unequivocally support reproductive rights, justice, and autonomy for all. The right to control our bodies and the ability to make healthcare decisions that should be private should not belong to any government or anyone other than ourselves,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with all abortion-seekers affected by this decision.” Sameeha Rizvi, vice president of the student-run UT Senate, said the coalition published the statement to emphasize “the lack of response from the university” to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She said students believed that collective action would help persuade UT to potentially take action on the demands.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man is in custody after police say he admitted attempting to hang one man and killing another as part of a “purge” that he claimed was directed by a higher power. Christian Francis Taele, 28, was arrested after police responding to a report of an assault found the 23-year-old victim strung from a piece of gym equipment at an apartment complex in Ogden on Saturday evening. It was unclear if Taele had an attorney who can speak on his behalf. KSL-TV reports he is being held for investigation of attempted murder. Witnesses said Taele, of Lake Shore, approached the victim, strangled him with a rope or strap, and kicked him numerous times before dragging him into the gym. The man was hospitalized and had no signs of brain activity. “The attack was unprovoked, and there is no indication that either the suspect or victim have ever spoken prior to the attack,” police wrote in an affidavit. While Ogden police were interviewing Taele, investigators say he confessed to a homicide in Spanish Fork and provided details of the slaying and the crime scene that had not been publicized. In that case, the body of 49-year-old Ryan Hooley was found next to a trash bin Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Leaders of the Vermont Army National Guard are investigating allegations of misconduct in recent months following a report made public last year on the Guard’s culture and policies. Vermont Adj. Gen. Greg Knight said in a statement Monday that he could not elaborate on the investigations but that it’s critical for members to know that “all members are, and will continue to be held accountable regardless of rank or position.” “I am disappointed that poor decisions and behavior continue to happen, but am glad to see our members report bad behavior when they see it,” he said. In November 2019, Knight requested an assessment by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations. The 113-page report released last year found the Vermont National Guard’s sexual assault polices lacked specifics to ensure compliance, a prevention program had inadequate resources, and many personnel perceived favoritism and a “good old boy” network. The investigation concluded that “the command climate and culture within the VTNG is generally sound, though there is room for improvement,” and made 35 recommendations. “Our people are by far the most important part of our organization,” Knight said in the statement. “These investigations are a result of our people trusting the process, and reporting aberrant behavior to the chain of command.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWhitewood: Flooding in a remote pocket of southwest Virginia has damaged more than 100 homes and left some 40 people unaccounted for, but there are no confirmed deaths or injuries, authorities said Wednesday. First responders in Buchanan County began receiving reports of rising water and damage Tuesday night, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. After daybreak, crews conducted aerial surveys to examine the extent of the disaster. Several small communities in the Virginia county that borders West Virginia and Kentucky were affected, according to the sheriff’s office. About 40 people – a mix of adults and children – were reported unaccounted for, but that number was expected to decrease as swift-water rescue teams continued to survey the area, authorities said. A shelter was established at a local school. Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Eric Breeding said the number of persons unaccounted for was based on relatives trying to contact a resident in an area where there may be limited or no phone service. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in trouble or in danger. They’re just letting us know that we need to check on these people,” Breeding said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, prosecutors said. According to King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office spokesperson Casey McNerthney, a judge on Monday ordered the 48-year-old man to remain jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail but denied prosecutors’ request for an anti-harassment order protecting Jayapal, The Seattle Times reports. In 2016, Jayapal became the first Indian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Seattle police arrested the man outside Jayapal’s house at 11:25 p.m. Saturday after she called 911 and reported an unknown person or people were in a vehicle using obscene language, a probable cause statement said. She told a dispatcher her husband thought someone may have fired a pellet gun, the statement said. Officers arrested a man who was standing in the middle of the street with his hands in the air and a .40-caliber handgun holstered on his waist, the probable cause statement said. A neighbor told police she heard the man yell something to the effect of “go back to India, I’m going to kill you,” the statement said. The neighbor also said the man drove by Jayapal’s residence at least three times, yelling profanities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A helicopter crash last month that killed six people occurred when the aircraft hit a rock face 15 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, federal investigators said in a preliminary report Tuesday. The Vietnam-era Bell UH-1B “Huey” helicopter struck the rock face in an area about 4 miles from Logan County Airport in Amherstdale, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in the report. The cockpit and cabin then crashed into a roadway and a guardrail and were consumed by fire. Investigators have not yet released any information about the cause of the accident. A final report could take a year or two to complete, they said. The June 22 flight was the last scheduled for the day during a multiday reunion for helicopter enthusiasts where visitors could sign up to ride or fly the historic Huey helicopter, described by organizers as one of the last of its kind still flying. The helicopter was flown by the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Knights of the Sky,” in Vinh Long, Vietnam, throughout much of the 1960s, according to the website for MARPAT Aviation, a Logan County flight school that operated the helicopter. After the Huey returned to the U.S. in 1971, the website says, it was featured in movies such as “Die Hard, “The Rock” and “Under Siege: Dark Territory.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A federal judge is siding with the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who objected to their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia. Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 violated their civil rights as well as those of their children. The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. The teachers were placed on administrative leave and later resigned, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Along with complaints about the assignment, the lawsuit also accused the district of discriminating against one of the children for his learning disability and failing to protect him from racist bullying. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents failed to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment. “A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local search and rescue responders are hoping to raise donations for a helicopter and secure county support to cover operational costs, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr announced the campaign Monday, saying the county’s search and rescue team responded to a record number of calls for service last year, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/29/pony-swim-bali-myna-hatches-giant-catfish-news-around-states/50539981/", "title": "Pony swim, Bali myna hatches, giant catfish: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMonroeville: The Swiss owner of a pulp mill in Alabama said it is investing $80 million to increase the amount of absorbent pulp it can produce there. The second line at the GP Cellulose Alabama River mill near Monroeville should be able to produce rolls of the absorbent material called fluff pulp in late 2023, a news release said. It said some major aspects are complete. The mill’s first line has been able to produce bales of paper pulp and rolls of fluff pulp since 2011. Fluff pulp is used in such items as diapers and feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products. The mill employs about 470 people.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A plane with seven people on board bound for Katmai National Park and Preserve crashed into the water as it was leaving a seaplane base in Anchorage, with two people suffering serious injuries, authorities said. Clint Johnson, chief of the National Transportation Safety Board’s Alaska division, said the information he initially received was that there were six people on board. He said he was later told there were seven on board. Aaron Danielson, chief of the Ted Stevens International Airport Police and Fire, said there was some “initial confusion on scene.” A statement from the department late Tuesday afternoon said all seven were taken to area hospitals for evaluation and treatment. Johnson said the plane operated by Regal Air had taken off and was in its initial climb phase when the accident occurred. The airport police and fire department said the plane was conducting a water takeoff “when, according to the pilot, a strong crosswind caused the right wing to rise after the plane was airborne. While the pilot attempted to make corrections,” the plane crashed. Johnson said investigators are still gathering information. There have been strong winds in the Anchorage area recently but “we don’t know if that played a part in it or not.” He said the passengers were from outside Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The Coconino County Board of Supervisors approved the transfer of $5 million to the county’s flood control district to deal with monsoonal flooding problems. Meanwhile Wednesday, Mayor Paul Deasy declared a state of emergency to make the city eligible for additional resources to support disaster response. The disaster grant assistance would help cover the costs associated with public infrastructure damage, including debris removal, emergency protective measures and the restoration of disaster-damaged, publicly owned facilities. Since July 16, Flagstaff has experienced days of steady and heavy rain that has inundated neighborhoods in the shadow of mountains that burned recently. County officials said the flash flooding has impacted the Timberline, Wupatki Trails and Doney Park areas, as well as the west side of Flagstaff. The annual monsoon season is expected to last through September, with the possibility of daily rainfall. County officials believe the continued costs of flood mitigation could exceed the costs of the aftermath of the Schultz Fire in 2010, which were $5.6 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Robert Craig, the oldest living World War II veteran of the 101st Airborne in Arkansas and the third-oldest World War II veteran in the U.S., celebrated his 100th birthday on July 18 amid much fanfare at the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. Craig was a part of the fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, the last major German offensive on the Western front. For almost a week during the battle, German soldiers surrounded Craig’s division. The Americans received supplies from airdrops. Gen. George Patton eventually broke through and delivered food and medical supplies. “I’m rather proud of the service I rendered,” said Craig, who received seven bronze stars and a presidential citation for his service.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The city’s newest bridge, a $588 million architectural marvel with views of the downtown skyline, opened to great fanfare on July 10 but has been closed several times since then amid chaos and collisions. The 6th Street Viaduct – which soars over the concrete-lined Los Angeles River to connect downtown to the historic Eastside – quickly became a hot spot for street racing, graffiti and illegal takeovers that draw hundreds of spectators to watch drivers perform dangerous stunts in their vehicles. The Los Angeles Police Department has closed the bridge multiple times – an exact count was not available Wednesday – and in the latest move, announced Tuesday that it would be “closed until further notice due to illegal activity and public safety concerns” before backtracking and reopening it hours later. Officials hope to install speed bumps, safety fences and cameras on the less than 3-week-old bridge to curtail the behavior. In the meantime, officers are impounding vehicles and issuing citations. The bridge spans 3,500 feet from the trendy Arts District to Boyle Heights, a traditionally working class Latino neighborhood, in the largest and most expensive bridge ever built in the city.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Conservation groups filed lawsuits against state environmental agencies in Colorado and Montana this week targeting coal mines in the states. Two groups sued Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality on Monday over an approved expansion of the Rosebud Mine, a coal strip mine near the Wyoming border. On Tuesday, five organizations including the WildEarth Guardians and the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against Colorado environmental agencies alleging they failed to ensure the state’s largest coal mine, West Elk Mine, complied with state and federal clean air laws. The complaint filed in Gunnison County District Court contended that Colorado state officials failed to approve or deny an air pollution permit required by the U.S. government within the 18 months allotted by state law. The federal permit, granted by state agencies, would allow greater oversight over the mine’s compliance with clean air laws and regulations, ensuring that the company was sufficiently restricting methane emissions. If the state denied the permit application, the mine would have to halt operations. West Elk Mine sits in Colorado’s North Fork Valley and is owned by Arch Resources, a company based in St. Louis. The mine produced more than 4 million tons of coal in 2019, according to the Colorado Division of Reclamation, and emits greenhouse gases, including methane.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Former House Minority Leader Themis Klarides, who is running for a chance to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal in November, has come under fire from the conservative wing of the party for her stances, including accusations she’s not a true Republican. More of that criticism was lodged Tuesday night, when Klarides appeared in the first GOP Senate debate with her two conservative challengers in the upcoming Aug. 9 primary. Leora Levy of Greenwich and attorney Peter Lumaj of Fairfield both oppose abortion and further restrictions on gun owners. “There is a contrast here,” Levy said, when comparing herself to Klarides. “And I’m running in a Republican primary, not a Democrat primary. And her views on abortion are more suited to running in a Democrat primary, are more like Senator Blumenthal’s.” Lumaj, however, referred to himself as the only “unwavering conservative” among the three candidates, criticizing Levy for previously supporting abortion rights. He said Republicans in Connecticut have lost statewide races because they nominated candidates who “were afraid to be a Republican.” But Klarides stressed a candidate with such conservative positions won’t win in Connecticut, where the largest voting block is made up of unaffiliated voters, followed by Democrats and then Republicans. There’s also strong support in the state for abortion rights, a key issue in this year’s election after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A catfish species that can grow up to 100 pounds and reach 4 feet in length is threatening a popular Delaware fishing hole and state environmental officials need anglers’ help to rid the waterway of the invasive fish. The culprit is the flathead catfish, a species native to the Mississippi and Ohio watersheds. It was recently found in Lums Pond near Glasgow, according to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. Catfish species native to Delaware are scavengers and feed off the bottom of the water bodies in which they live. The flathead catfish eats other species, said Mike Steiger, a DNREC fisheries biologist. If the flathead catfish is left to feed on local species such as shad, crayfish or other pond fish, it could upset the local ecosystem and cause problems for other organisms in the area. “There’s probably not that many in the pond,” Steiger said. “Unchecked, they can definitely have a negative effect on native species.” Steiger is heading a project for the DNREC Division of Fish and Wildlife with the DNREC Division of Parks and Recreation aimed at removing the flathead catfish from Lums Pond. To capture the invasive species, the groups are using the technique of electro fishing, in which a specialized boat is used to deliver electroshocks in the water that temporarily stuns fish within a certain radius. This does not kill any of the fish but causes the affected fish to rise to the top of water, allowing them to be handled and captured more easily and with less stress for the fish. All flathead catfish that are found are then removed from Lums Pond. DNREC urges all who catch a flathead catfish to remove it from the water and report the incident.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Congressional leaders and Kansas officials praised aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart for advancing the cause of women’s rights during her barrier-breaking career at a ceremony unveiling her statue in the U.S. Capitol. Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, joins President Dwight Eisenhower as Kansas icons enshrined in the National Statuary Hall Collection. She is the 11th woman honored with a statue in the collection, where each state is represented by two people of significance. U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, D-Kan., said although Earhart is best known for flying across the ocean, she was also a military nurse, social worker, author and a champion for women’s advancement. “Female pilots used to be called ‘ladybirds,’ ‘sweethearts of the air,’ and because of Amelia Earhart, back then, now and into the future, women who fly planes are now called ‘pilots,’ ” Davids said. Earhart disappeared in July 1937 on a flight over the Pacific Ocean while trying to become the first pilot to circle the globe at the equator. No trace of her or her navigator, Fred Noonan, has ever been found, sparking numerous theories about what happened to them.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: A woman who left her newborn baby in a trash bin pleaded guilty to attempted murder and child abuse, agreeing to a seven-year prison sentence and potential deportation. Two maintenance workers at a Boca Raton apartment complex heard faint crying sounds coming from the bin and rescued Rafaelle Sousa’s 6-pound, 8-ounce baby. She was taken in by her boyfriend, who named her Sarah, the Palm Beach Post reported. Sousa’s attorney said the 38-year-old Brazilian woman didn’t know she was pregnant until she went into labor, and was in shock when the baby was born three years ago. Sousa, who was already caring for her 3-year-old son, had taken Tylenol and diet pills in the months before the birth to cope with pain and sudden weight gain, but wasn’t able to afford a doctor’s visit and did not know she was expecting another child, her attorney said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Democrat Stacey Abrams is promoting a plan she said will make housing more available and affordable across Georgia if she defeats Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this year. Abrams repeatedly criticized Kemp for Georgia’s sluggish use of its $989 million in federal rental assistance. Georgia still has almost half that money unused, Abrams said, although the state gave more of it to 12 large local governments that have been quicker to move the money out the door after the U.S. Treasury threatened to take some of it back. Tate Mitchell, a spokesperson for Kemp, said Abrams has Democrats to blame for making the cost of living more expensive. “In the last year alone, Gov. Kemp has allocated $100 million to support nonprofits that provide affordable housing and aid individuals experiencing homelessness,” Mitchell said in a statement. “If Stacey Abrams wants to blame anyone for economic instability, she should start with Joe Biden and her own party.” Abrams said she would seek to bolster Georgia’s weak tenant protections by requiring that leases guarantee the premises will be habitable and by providing a waiting period before a tenant could be evicted. She also would expand state assistance for down payments for first-time homebuyers, require that housing built using the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit serve some households with very low incomes and let local governments offer property tax breaks on affordable housing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A U.S. defense contractor and his wife who lived for decades under the identities of two dead Texas children have been charged with identity theft and conspiring against the government, according to federal court records unsealed in Honolulu. Walter Glenn Primrose and Gwynn Darle Morrison, both in their 60s, who allegedly lived for decades under the names Bobby Edward Fort and Julie Lyn Montague, were arrested Friday in Kapolei on the island of Oahu. Prosecutors are seeking to have the couple held without bail, which could indicate the case is about more than fraudulently obtaining drivers’ licenses, passports and Defense Department credentials. Those documents helped Primrose get secret security clearance with the U.S. Coast Guard and as a defense contractor and old photos showed the couple wearing uniforms of the KGB, the former Russian spy agency, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Muehleck said in court papers. Faded Polaroids of each in uniform were included in the motion to have them held. A “close associate” said Morrison lived in Romania while it was a Soviet bloc country, Muehleck said. Morrison’s attorney said her client never lived in Romania and that she and Primrose tried the same jacket on as a joke and posed for photos in it. Even if the couple used new identities, attorney Megan Kau told The Associated Press, they have lived law-abiding lives for three decades.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho has been selected as the site for a proposed nuclear test reactor that would dramatically reduce the time needed to develop nuclear fuels and components for a new generation of nuclear reactors that could help reduce global warming, the U.S. Department of Energy said. The Energy Department said it selected its 890-square-mile site in eastern Idaho that includes the Idaho National Laboratory to build the Versatile Test Reactor, or VTR. The VTR is a sodium-cooled fast test reactor that would be the first fast spectrum test reactor to operate in the United States in nearly three decades. The Energy Department has requested funding from Congress to move the VTR project into the design phase. The project includes facilities for examining material tested in the reactor, as well as managing spent fuel produced by the reactor. Scientists have said the test reactor could help lead to new nuclear reactors and reduce the use of fossil fuels blamed for global warming. The Energy Department is hoping to have the test reactor running by the end of 2026. Currently, such nuclear testing capacity only exists in Russia, the department said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, 77, of Illinois said he tested positive for the coronavirus and was in quarantine with what he described as minor symptoms. The No. 2 Senate Democrat, who said in a statement he was vaccinated and received two booster shots, planned to continue to work remotely. Durbin’s announcement occurred after Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said last week he tested positive following travel to the White House, Maine and Florida. Earlier this week, Pritzker said on Twitter that he tested negative for the virus. On Wednesday, President Joe Biden ended his COVID-19 isolation, days after he also tested positive.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has ordered Indianapolis Public Schools to allow a 10-year-old transgender girl to rejoin her school’s softball team while a lawsuit continues against a state law that bans transgender females from competing in girls school sports. U.S. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson in Indianapolis issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday on behalf of the girl, finding she “has established that she has a strong likelihood of succeeding on the merits” of her claim. Indianapolis Public School told the girl’s mother earlier this year that her daughter would no longer be able to play on the softball team because of the new law, the judge added. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed the lawsuit on behalf of the girl in hopes of blocking the law. The suit was filed in May, minutes after Republican state lawmakers voted to override Gov. Eric Holcomb’s veto of the legislation, and alleged that preventing the girl from rejoining her team because she is transgender is violation of Title IX and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials are asking residents to keep an eye out for the spotted laternfly after recently confirming the finding of two of the invasive insects in central Iowa. As a young nymph, it is a black weevil-like bug with white spots but adds patches of bright red as it develops into a flying insect. It’s native to China, India and Vietnam, and was accidentally introduced into Pennsylvania in 2014, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship. It has since been confirmed in 11 states and threatens the country’s grape, orchard, nursery and logging industries. The state agricultural department was notified earlier this month of the presence of two immature spotted lanternflies in Dallas County, and federal identification confirmed them. Nearby areas surveyed have not resulted in signs of an ongoing infestation, the department said. Anyone spotting the insect is asked to contact the department’s Entomology and Plant Science Bureau.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:A Bali myna, one of the world’s rarest – and some say most beautiful – birds was hatched this month at the Topeka Zoo. The Asian songbird was born July 2, making it the third species of that bird at the zoo, said Joe Maloney, who works at the zoo with invertebrates. Bali mynas are among the most vocal birds in the zoo’s Tropical Rainforest, where their distinctive plumage and calls make them easily recognizable, Maloney said. The critically endangered The population of Bali mynas in the wild has been reduced by habitat loss and illegal trapping carried out to acquire them to be caged songbirds, said Taylor Miller, the Topeka Zoo’s communications coordinator. Females of the species tend to lay one to three eggs but usually only one will survive, Miller said. “They are cavity nesters, so the chick is currently located in a special box built by keepers,” she said. The box simulates a cavity nest but allows enough space for animal care staff to keep a close watch on them, Miller said. “The mom and dad are excellent parents and you can regularly catch glimpses of them carrying food to their nesting area,” said Wrylie Guffey, animal curator at the zoo. Bali mynas begin flying when they are 3-4 weeks old and become fully independent when they are 6-7 weeks old, Miller said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The University of Pikeville will receive a $4.4 million grant to support construction of an agritech research and education center. The UPIKE Ag-Tech Innovation Center of Excellence will be located at the Kentucky Enterprise Industrial Park at Marion Branch in Pikeville, state officials said. The project will be matched with $5.75 million in local funds. Gov. Andy Beshear announced the grant award Wednesday. The project aims to promote job growth by bringing innovative industry to the area while enhancing educational opportunities for UPIKE students, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nChauvin: Authorities in south-central Louisiana are looking for those responsible for vandalizing the Chauvin Sculpture Garden, a local landmark created by a self-taught artist. Three concrete sculptures were broken, and one is missing, said Gary LaFleur, head of the Center for Bayou Studies at Nicholls State University. Vandals also damaged a sculpture of an angel that held an amber globe, similar to how the Statue of Liberty holds its torch. The garden owned by Nicholls State was created by self-taught artist Kenny Hill when he moved to Chauvin in 1988. A bricklayer by trade, Hill created more than 100 concrete statues along Bayou Little Caillou in Terrebonne Parish before walking away from his home about a decade later. He left no trace of his whereabouts, but about 10,000 visitors each year visit the menagerie of angels, Cajuns, self portraits and other figures he left behind.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Roman Catholic priest is returning to active ministry after an investigation into allegations of sexual abuse, the Diocese of Portland said. The diocese said its investigation into the Rev. Robert Vaillancourt took a year. The allegations concerned sexual abuse of girls in the 1980s. The diocese said in a statement the allegations were “determined to be unfounded.” It said Vaillancourt has not received a new assignment from the diocese yet. Vaillancourt was placed on administrative leave in July 2021 after the diocese received the first complaint. The diocese then received a second allegation from an attorney representing another woman. Vaillancourt denied any wrongdoing at the time of the accusations and the diocese said he cooperated with the investigation. He is a native of Lewiston who has served at parishes across the state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island: More military ordnance has washed ashore at Assateague Island National Seashore, the Worcester County Fire Marshal’s Office reported. The fire marshal’s office, along with the U.S. Air Force 436th Civil Engineer Squadron-Emergency Ordnance Disposal team based out of Dover Air Force Base responded to Assateague shortly after 1 p.m. Tuesday for three suspected military ordnance that washed ashore in an area known as North Ocean Beach. It is the second incident of military ordnance washing ashore at Assateauge in as many weeks. National Park Service Rangers reported the suspicious devices. Ordnance disposal technicians determined the devices, which had been in the ocean for an unknown amount of time, needed to be rendered safe in place. From 1944 to 1947, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Corps used the Maryland portion of Assateague Island as a bombing and strafing range. Air crews from Chincoteague, Virginia, and Manteo, North Carolina, would fire practice rockets, bombs and machine guns from the air at targets on the ground.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nFitchburg: A decorated State Police dog called “as loyal a partner as any Trooper ever had” by the agency’s commander was shot and killed by a man who had barricaded himself inside a home. Frankie, a nearly 11-year-old Belgian malinois with a tan coat and black snout, was shot Tuesday afternoon by a 38-year-old suspect, according to a statement from State Police Col. Christopher Mason. He was the first State Police dog to die in the line of duty, Mason said. Frankie’s handler, Sgt. David Stucenski, was not injured. Stucenski and Frankie won the state law enforcement Medal of Valor in 2017 for apprehending a suspect who opened fire on them, and also won three awards from the U.S. Police Canine Association in 2014. Police went to the multifamily Fitchburg home at about 9 a.m. Tuesday after learning the suspect, wanted on warrants charging him with firearms offenses, was there. Negotiators tried to get the suspect to surrender peacefully but he refused. Just before 3 p.m., he was spotted at a back door and officers decided to try and apprehend him. Stucenski and Frankie approached, but the suspect fired multiple shots before retreating back inside. He later apparently took his own life. Frankie was shot and taken to an animal hospital where he died, Mason said. Frankie’s body was escorted in a motorcade to the Final Gift Pet Memorial Center pet crematorium in Cranston, Rhode Island, as police officers and firefighters paid tribute on overpasses along the highway. A service to honor Frankie will be held, although a date hasn’t been set, state police said Wednesday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A man who admitted to calling in a bomb threat at the state Capitol was sentenced Wednesday to one year in jail, Attorney General Dana Nessel said. Michael Varrone, 49, of Charlotte pleaded guilty last month to false report or threat of bomb/harmful device. Prosecutors dismissed two terrorism charges against him. Judge James Jamo sentenced Varrone to one year in the Ingham County Jail with no possibility of early release and three years’ probation, Nessel said. Varrone must also undergo mental health treatment.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: Workers at the largest sugar beet processor in the U.S. have rejected a contract offer that includes a 17% pay increase over four years. Union President John Riskey said the offer from American Crystal Sugar was recently rejected by an overwhelming margin, but he did not provide details on how many members voted or the margin of rejection. The Moorhead-based cooperative said it negotiated for 10 days with the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers’ International Union. The company said in addition to the pay increase, the contract offered more vacation, increased pension benefits and a $1,000 ratification bonus if the new contract was approved by Sunday, when the current contract expires. Riskey said workers felt they deserved a bigger pay increase after helping the company weather the COVID-19 pandemic. Riskey said workers want contract talks to continue, Minnesota Public Radio reported. American Crystal said the new deadline for an agreement is Sept. 15. It agreed to continuing contract talks with a federal mediator.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said a deadly bacteria has been found in environmental samples on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The discovery of the bacteria is the first in the U.S. According to a CDC release, a person on the coast was diagnosed with melioidosis in 2020, a rare disease caused by a bacteria known as Burkholderia pseudomallei. A second person living in close geographic proximity was diagnosed with the disease in 2022. The cases prompted state health officials and the CDC to take samples and test household products, soil and water in and around both patients’ homes, with permission. The bacteria was found in samples of soil and standing water. How long it has been on the coast and its spatial distribution isn’t known, but the CDC said conditions are conducive to its growth along all Gulf Coast states. The CDC said an average of 12 cases of the disease occur annually in the U.S., but according to state epidemiologist Paul Byers, most of those cases are the result of travel to countries where the bacteria have been known to occur. Melioidosis has a wide range of nonspecific symptoms such as fever, joint pain and headaches and can cause conditions that include pneumonia, abscess formation or blood infections. Worldwide, melioidosis is fatal in 10% to 50% of those infected, according to the CDC.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city’s Department of Workforce Development has been awarded a $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Labor that will run through 2026. The grant money will go toward bolstering registered apprenticeship programs during the ongoing labor shortage. The Department of Workforce Development was one of 30 organizations nationwide, and the only one in Missouri, to be awarded this grant funding, according to a news release.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls:Montana posted 2,320 newly reported COVID-19 cases in the last week and the state’s total active confirmed reports stand at 2,199, with 109 active hospitalizations, according to the state website. Cascade County reported 192 new cases, bringing the actives cases to 205. One death has been reported, a male in his 80s, vaccinated but not boosted, with underlying health conditions. The community level in Cascade County has dropped from high to medium this week. Benefis Hospital reported 14 hospitalized by the virus.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpringfield: Meta, Facebook’s parent company, announced plans Thursday to expand a data center it is building in the Omaha suburbs. A Meta spokesperson said the social media giant now plans to build a ninth building in the complex it is constructing in Papillion and Springfield southwest of Omaha in Sarpy County. The company said the data center will cost more than $1.5 billion and eventually include 4 million square feet. Meta plans to complete the project it began in 2017 by the end of 2024. About 150 people are maintaining computers at the site that is expected to employ about 300. Six of the nine buildings are operational. Meta said all of the data center’s electricity will come from renewable energy, including wind farms in northeast Nebraska and Kansas. Several other major companies have built data centers in the area around the Meta data center, including Google, Yahoo, Travelers Insurance and Fidelity Investments.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Parents and students will again be faced with an alternating bus schedule when school starts on Aug. 15 as the Washoe County School District struggles with staffing shortages. Bus routes will be suspended for one week on a rotating basis in each of the district’s five service areas. The calendar for bus rotation schedules is available on the district’s website. Additional student transportation bus information will be available on Aug. 5. Students in remote areas will continue to have daily bus service, said Adam Searcy, chief facilities management officer, during a school board meeting Tuesday. Those neighborhoods are: Rancho Haven, Antelope Valley, Hungry Valley, Palomino Valley, Nixon, Wadsworth and Natchez. Buses designated for special education students will continue in full operation, as required by federal law. Searcy said additional neighborhoods will return to daily transportation as more bus drivers become available. Bus drivers will be sent to work in areas with the greatest need. Families will be given advance notice before returning to the daily transportation system. Searcy added he hopes the entire school district will return to a daily transportation system by fall break.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A woman has pleaded guilty to charges she sold unapproved drugs on her website that claimed to be remedies and treatments for COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Justice said. U.S. Attorney Jane E. Young said in a news release that Diana Daffin, 69, of Charlotte, North Carolina, pleaded guilty Wednesday to selling unapproved drugs with the intent to defraud or mislead the Food and Drug Administration. In February 2021, Daffin sold an undercover law enforcement officer a product advertised as a drug that could cure, mitigate, treat and prevent COVID-19 in humans. Daffin later sold and shipped that drug and other unapproved drugs to the undercover agent, according to prosecutors. Daffin is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 2.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Officials from the Golden Nugget will negotiate Thursday with Atlantic City’s main casino workers union on a new contract that would guarantee the seaside gambling resort labor peace for four years. The Golden Nugget is the only one of Atlantic City’s nine casinos without a new deal with Local 54 of the Unite Here union. The sides were expected to negotiate Thursday morning, and the likelihood of a deal appears high given the fact that the rest of the city’s casinos have agreed to new pacts. Thursday’s session followed the successful completion of negotiations Wednesday with Resorts casino on a new contract that contains the same economic elements as those reached with other casinos. Housekeeping employees will see their pay increase to $22 an hour at the end of the four-year contract. In addition to raises, the agreements maintain fully funded family health care and pension benefits, language that protects jobs and increases work opportunities, and new technology protections, the union said. The union has authorized a strike on Saturday if a new contract is not reached with Golden Nugget.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities have identified the bodies of three people who died in fast-moving floodwaters in Tecolote Canyon in northern New Mexico. San Miguel County sheriff’s officials said the victims were members of a West Texas family and were swept away last week during monsoon rains in mountainous terrain scorched by a 533-square mile wildfire. They said the three from Hale County were identified as 62-year-old Jimmy Chris Cummings, his 62-year-old wife Linda Jane Cummings and her 84-year-old mother Betty Greenhaw. Authorities said the women’s bodies were discovered in Tecolote Creek floodwaters July 22 near their truck, which also had been swept from the cabin the family owned. The body of Jimmy Cummings was found Tuesday within debris left by the flood in the creek, according to sheriff’s officials. The cabin the family owned in Tecolote Canyon on Camp Blue Haven property for more than 60 years was destroyed by the floodwaters.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: New York is inching toward becoming the first U.S. city to charge motorists an extra fee for entering its most congested areas. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said a long-delayed environmental assessment should be released by federal regulators next month, to be followed by public hearings. The MTA also named the members of a board that will decide the plan’s pricing, discounts and exemptions. The practice is commonly referred to as congestion pricing and has been used in cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm. In New York, motorists entering Manhattan below 60th Street would be charged a toll electronically. The revenue, estimated at $1 billion annually, would be used to back borrowing for capital improvements to the MTA’s subway and bus systems. The tolls aren’t expected to be implemented until late next year at the earliest. Some lawmakers in New Jersey have said the plan is unfair because motorists already pay tolls at bridges and tunnels to enter New York, and the money from congestion pricing won’t be used to improve public transit in New Jersey. Some motorists paying tolls to enter Manhattan from New Jersey are expected to receive discounts or be exempt.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Tens of thousands of people convicted of felonies but who aren’t behind bars can now register to vote and cast ballots following an appeals court ruling. Expanding the scope of those able to register and vote began Wednesday, the State Board of Elections said – the day after local elections were held in more than a dozen localities. The change proceeds from litigation challenging a 1973 law that prevents someone convicted of a felony from having voting rights restored while they are still on probation, parole or post-release supervision. A panel of trial judges struck down the law in March, declaring it violates the state constitution largely because it discriminates against Black residents. The state Supreme Court agreed in May to hear an appeal of that decision, and the case remains pending. But the justices didn’t touch a Court of Appeals ruling that prevented registration requests from the felons who weren’t in prison or jail from being fulfilled only through Tuesday. So these applicants – for now and unless the Supreme Court reverses the trial court ruling – will be able to vote, starting with the November general election.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A judge put on hold the state’s trigger law banning abortion while a lawsuit moves forward that argues it violates the state constitution, ruling the attorney general had prematurely calculated the date when the ban should take effect. Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick sided with the state’s only abortion clinic, the Red River Women’s Clinic in Fargo, that Attorney General Drew Wrigley “prematurely attempted to execute” the trigger language. The clinic had argued that a 30-day clock should not have started until the U.S. Supreme Court issued its certified judgment on Tuesday. The ban had been set to take effect on Thursday. Shortly after the ruling, Wrigley said he was heading to the North Dakota Legislative Council’s office to drop off another certification of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that reversed Roe vs. Wade. He did not comment about the judge’s order. North Dakota’s law would make abortion illegal in the state except in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A man accused of raping and impregnating a 10-year-old Ohio girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion was ordered held without bond Thursday by a judge who cited overwhelming evidence and the fact he apparently is living in the U.S. illegally. Gerson Fuentes, 27, faces two counts of raping the girl, who turned 10 before having the abortion in a case that has become a flashpoint in the national discussion about access to the procedure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. He has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Fuentes, who is from Guatemala, faces the possibility of life in prison with no chance of parole. That penalty and “not having any ties to this community that can be proved legally makes it a substantial flight risk,” Franklin County Judge Julie Lynch said after a 35-minute hearing. The girl confirmed that Fuentes attacked her, Fuentes confessed to Columbus police detectives and DNA testing of the aborted fetus confirmed Fuentes was the father, Franklin County Prosecutor Dan Meyer and Detective Jeffrey Huhn said in court Thursday. Huhn said he was unable, when searching multiple databases, to find any evidence that Fuentes was in the country legally. Fuentes’ attorney, Bryan Bowen, argued against a no-bond hearing and unsuccessfully asked Lynch to set a reasonable bond. He said there was no evidence of physical abuse outside of the rapes or that the girl had been put under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He also said Fuentes had family ties in Columbus, that he had a job, and that there was no evidence of a criminal history. Fuentes has lived in the area about seven years.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The second half of Scissortail Park will open Sept. 23, with events running that weekend from Friday night to Sunday night. The park will be the relaxed counterpart to the more heavily programmed upper portion, and at the same time be a place for children to play soccer, basketball, futsal and pickleball. MAPS 4 Program Manager David Todd said construction crews just have “finishing touches” left before the park is ready for its first visitors. The upper and lower portions of the park were funded by the voter-approved MAPS 3 penny sales tax, which ran from April 2010 to December 2017. The price tag for the park’s lower portion is now $24.5 million, a 9.5% increase over the original $22.2 million budget. The increase was paid for through higher-than-expected sales tax collections. The park project broke ground in November 2020.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A new audit from the Secretary of State has found Oregon’s unemployment insurance system experienced many problems during the pandemic, delaying payments to thousands of workers who lost jobs. The audit highlights known issues including the Employment Department’s antiquated and inflexible computer system and frequent turnover in its executive ranks. Previous audits warned that the agency’s mainframe system, dating to the 1990s, was too rigid to handle complicated claims or rule changes, and relied too much on manual processes, leading to errors. A 2015 audit recommended the system be replaced – a process that is only now underway.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Four Pennsylvania universities said they will follow through with tuition increases despite calls from state House Republicans to roll back the price hikes. The lawmakers, including Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Franklin, the GOP nominee for governor, argued Penn State, the University of Pittsburgh, Lincoln and Temple are receiving federal funds and do not need to increase tuition. The universities did not receive a bump in funding in this year’s state budget. Instead, through one-time federal funds, the universities will split about $30 million on top of budget funding. At Penn State, in-state undergraduate students will see tuition increase by 5% at the University Park campus and 2% at the Commonwealth Campuses. Nonresidents will see a 6% tuition increase at University Park and a 3% increase at the Commonwealth campuses. A 5% increase will be instituted for Penn State World Campus undergraduates. Most in-state students paying full tuition at Pitts’ campus will see their tuition rate rise by 3.5%. Regional campus tuition rates will rise by 2%. Temple students will see a 3.9% increase for 2022–2023 undergraduate and graduate base tuition for in-state and out-of-state students. Lincoln’s tuition will increased by less than 1% for the incoming class, according to figures on its website. A university spokesperson didn’t immediately confirm the increase amount.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket:As primary elections near, the city agreed to halt the enforcement of an ordinance restricting the placement of political signs in yards more than 30 days before an election as the parties work out a resolution in the case. The city reached a consent agreement with the state affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union before a court hearing Thursday not to enforce limitations on timing, lighting and size of political yard signs. Under the agreement, the city will not enforce, nor threaten to enforce, “any size, placement, and/or illumination restrictions on political campaign signs, including but not limited to candidate campaign signs or issue signs, that are more stringent than those imposed on nonpolitical signs.” The ordinance had also specified that signs could not be illuminated or exceed 12 square feet. The ACLU sued the city Tuesday on behalf of two Democratic candidates for state legislature – Jennifer Stewart and Cherie Cruz – arguing the ordinance banning the posting of political yard signs more than 30 days before an election was unconstitutional and should be struck down.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Turning around the state’s chronically dangerous juvenile prisons is now the job of Eden Hendrick, a prosecutor who sent some of those children to jail. Hendrick is leading the state Department of Juvenile Justice after two of her predecessors resigned following state audits that found major faults, from a “useless and ineffective” in-house police force to an inability to keep children safe. “We’ve been fighting this battle for a long time,” Hendrick said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I’m very hopeful that now that it’s actually getting some traction, and that we’ll be able to actually start to provide these youths the real services that they need.” Hendrick was confirmed in May shortly before the agency agreed to sweeping reforms at the main juvenile prison. Fixes included installing a modern surveillance system, revising use of force rules, reducing solitary confinement and making sure children get physical and recreational activity. Hendrick, who took over as interim director in September, is asking for time, to change the prisons and the culture of an agency whose employees often feel forgotten and unappreciated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The proposed budget for the Aberdeen School District is up 3.3% from a year ago, and COVID-19 grant funding is a major reason why. That money will allow for the construction of a greenhouse and new classrooms at the A-TEC Academy on the Central High School campus. Finance Director Tom Janish presented the proposed budget for 2022-23 to the Aberdeen School Board during this week’s meeting. The board heard about the preliminary budget in May. The final budget has to be approved at the end of September. Until then, the school board can make adjustments. For the 2022-23 school year, the overall budget is projected at $59.38 million, with about $10 million going toward the the capital outlay fund and special education fund. Another $33.5 million is for the general fund, with the remaining dollars going toward debt service, food service and other areas. Overall, the general fund will see a 3.3% increase. The state's contribution to the general fund is going up about 6% to $18.77 million. That's about 56% of total general fund revenue, Janish said. Most of the rest of the money will come from property taxes.\n\nTennessee\n\nCharleston: A German chemical company plans to add 200 jobs through an expansion at its Tennessee campus. The state Department of Economic and Community Development said Wacker has begun a feasibility study to add new silicone production facilities in Charleston. A $200 million investment there would be phased over several years. The company employs 700 people at the site. The first phase of the expansion would add plants to produce high-consistency silicone rubber and silicone sealants. In 2015, Wacker began producing hyper-pure polysilicon for semi-conductor and high-efficiency solar cells. In 2019, Wacker added production of pyrogenic silica. With the new announcement, the company will have invested nearly $3 billion at the site.\n\nTexas\n\nGlen Rose: A wildfire that blackened 101/ 2 square miles of north Texas, destroying 16 homes, reached 40% containment Wednesday, double what it had been the day before, officials said. The multiagency firefighting team fighting the Chalk Mountain Fire 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth said it had completed a fire line around the blaze Wednesday. However, the lines are sufficient only to be impervious to further spreading in 40% of the fire zone, primarily its southern reaches. In a statement, team officials said work continues to improve the lines around the rest of the zone while also attacking stubborn hot spots within the zone’s interior. No injuries have been reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A stormy day of rain helped firefighters battling the Dodge Springs Fire near the Utah-Nevada border on Monday, but the fire was still just 10% contained and threatened to flare back up if winds and hotter temperatures persisted, officials said. The fire, which was burning in Washington County about 25 miles northwest of St. George, began July 22, sparked by a lightning strike. It was burning through pinyon pines and juniper trees in rough terrain that was difficult for firefighters to access but remote enough that there had been no evacuations or road closures.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:LandAir, the trucking firm with facilities in Williston and Windsor that closed unexpectedly earlier this month, has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, meaning it will not be reorganized but will be liquidated. The company has about $3 million in assets and about $43 million in debts, according to documents filed in federal bankruptcy court in Massachusetts, where LandAir is based. Only two creditors have secured claims – Banc of California for $5 million and Corbel Capital Partners, the Los Angeles-based private investment firm that owned the company, for nearly $34 million. There are hundreds of unsecured creditors across the country, which include many Vermont companies. In addition, brothers Thomas and William Spencer, whose father Fred founded what would become LandAir in Burlington in 1968 as Allied Air Freight, are owed $137,500 each as the result of a lawsuit. The brothers’ attorney declined to comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: The Chincoteague Pony Swim returned Wednesday morning for the first time since the pandemic. The move of the ponies across the Assateague Channel is a 97-year tradition attended by enthusiastic spectators, many of whom arrived hours early to claim the best spots. Shortly after 9 a.m., a red-orange flare shot up from a Coast Guard boat, signaling to the group of horseback riders known as the Saltwater Cowboys that it was time to bring the ponies across the channel. The ponies didn’t want to be hurried, though, and paused to nibble on grass in the shallow water at the start of their journey. The ponies were submerged up to their necks, water churning as they made their way across the channel. It was over in 41/ 2 minutes. The swim raises money to buy equipment for the fire department, pays the roughly $45,000 yearly vet bill for the ponies and funds eight scholarships for Chincoteague high schoolers, said Denise Bowden, a spokeswoman for the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. After the swim, about 65 foals were auctioned. It’s important to reduce the population of the horses because the fire department has an agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to keep only 150 ponies on Assateague, Bowden said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: People in the state’s most populous county should soon be able to drop off unwanted guns and ammunition at any sheriff’s office or storefront location, assured of its safe disposal. The Metropolitan King County Council unanimously approved legislation Tuesday to create a permanent program within its Sheriff’s Office that allows people to voluntarily return firearms and ammunition, The Seattle Times reported. The legislation asks the county executive to evaluate the feasibility of allowing drop offs and allowing people to request a sheriff’s deputy to pick up an unwanted firearm. People also could drop off guns at locations in the 10 contract cities where the county sheriff provides police services. And the legislation asks the sheriff to look for partnerships with other cities to expand access for people looking to turn over guns or ammunition. During a 2013 gun buyback program coordinated by King County and the city of Seattle, 716 firearms were surrendered to law enforcement in exchange for gift cards.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The deadline to apply for the school clothing allowance has been extended because of a system outage that is affecting multiple state agencies, the Department of Health and Human Resources said. Children who are eligible will receive a $200 benefit each to buy school clothing or piece goods to sew clothing. Families can apply online at wvpath.org, and applications are due by 5 p.m. Aug. 12. Local DHHR offices can supply paper applications, which must be postmarked by Aug. 12. Automatic benefits will go to families with school-age children by the end of June who receive WV WORKS cash assistance; parents or guardians of children in foster care; and children ages 4 to 18 who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, are enrolled in school and whose household income is under 130% of the federal poverty level.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A conservative law firm is pushing back against a Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that transparency advocates said has damaged the state’s open records law by limiting when people who sue over records requests can recover attorney’s fees. The Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty on Thursday called for the Republican-controlled Legislature to strengthen open records laws in response to a 4-3 ruling earlier this month by the conservative-controlled Supreme Court that found that if an entity decides to release records after being sued, the requester can be awarded attorney’s fees only if a court issues a ruling, the Wisconsin State Journal reported. In a policy brief, WILL urged the Legislature to amend state law to ensure that requesters will be able to recover attorney’s fees if they prevail in open records lawsuits. The brief offered multiple suggestions for how to amend the law.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An accident involving the aerial tram at the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort on Saturday left a contractor severely injured, the Casper Star Tribune reported.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/24/hemingway-champ-tribal-powwow-baby-box-salvation-news-around-states/50522975/", "title": "Hemingway champ, tribal powwow, 'baby box' salvation: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama’s unemployment rate dropped to 2.6% in June, marking the third straight month with a record low for the state. The rate, which dropped one-tenth of a percentage point from May, represented 60,388 people without jobs statewide, a record low, according to a statement by Gov. Kay Ivey. More than 2.2 million people were working in the state, an increase of about 5,300 from a month earlier.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy is expected this week to sign legislation to formally recognize tribes in the state. The Alaska Federation of Natives announced the bill signing would take place Thursday. Shannon Mason, a Dunleavy spokesperson, confirmed the timing. The measure, from state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky, D-Bethel, passed the Legislature in May. Supporters of the bill have called it an overdue step that would create opportunities for the state and tribes to work together. The Alaska Federation of Natives said the measure “does not impact the existing legal status of Alaska Tribes, nor does it change the state’s responsibility or authority. However, it does recognize Alaska’s Indigenous people. This recognition will help unify our tribal governments with the state government.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has dismissed Gov. Doug Ducey’s lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s demands the state stop sending millions in federal COVID-19 relief money to schools that don’t have mask requirements or that close because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The state filed the lawsuit earlier this year after the U.S. Treasury Department demanded Ducey either restructure the $163 million program to eliminate restrictions it said undermine public health recommendations or face a repayment demand. The Treasury Department also wanted changes to a $10 million program Ducey created that gives private school tuition money to parents if their children’s schools have mask mandates.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers took back the authority they gave for the state to distribute about $460 million in remaining federal COVID-19 relief funds to school districts, saying they want schools to use the money for teacher and staff bonuses. The move faced opposition from Democrats who said it was an effort to avoid considering raising teacher salaries while the state sits on a $1.6 billion surplus. It was also criticized by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said lawmakers didn’t have authority to take such a step. The Legislative Council voted to rescind the appropriation for the federal funds, and recommended schools use the money for bonuses. The council said the districts’ plans for spending the money will now have to go before a legislative panel. The council recommended districts use the funds to provide $5,000 one-time bonuses to teachers and $2,500 to staff.\n\nCalifornia\n\nJerseydale: A destructive wildfire near Yosemite National Park burned out of control through tinder-dry forest on Sunday and had grown into one of California’s largest blazes of the year, forcing thousands of residents to flee remote mountain communities. About 2,000 firefighters battled the fire, along with aircraft and bulldozers, facing tough conditions that includes steep terrain, sweltering temperatures and low humidity, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Crews on the ground protected homes as air tankers dropped retardant on 50-foot flames racing along ridgetops east of the small community of Jerseydale. Light winds blew embers ahead into tree branches “and because it’s so dry, it’s easy for the spot fires to get established and that’s what fuels the growth,” Fouts said. The fire erupted Friday southwest of the park near the town of Midpines in Mariposa County. Officials described “explosive fire behavior” on Saturday as flames made runs through bone-dry vegetation caused by the worst drought in decades. By Sunday the blaze had consumed more than 22 square miles of forest land, with no containment, Cal Fire said. The cause was under investigation. Evacuations were in place for more than 6,000 people living across a several-mile span of the sparsely populated area in the Sierra Nevada foothills, though a handful of residents defied the orders and stayed behind, said Adrienne Freeman with the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The West Nile virus was detected in trapped mosquitoes in the southeast and southwest parts of the city, the Larimer County health department said in a news release. As of Tuesday, there are no human cases of West Nile virus, the health department. In humans, West Nile symptoms can range from none to severe (fever, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, aches, rash and headaches) and appear three to 14 days after infection, the health department said. One percent of people might develop a serious, neuroinvasive form of the disease, said Dr. Paul Mayer, medical officer with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. Larimer County began monitoring for West Nile virus in early June. Monitoring is done through a partnership with the cities in Larimer County, Vector Disease Control International and Colorado State University. The peak West Nile season is generally in July and August.

The legislation, which increases funding for the initiative, raises the MSRP cap for eligible purchased and leased battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to $50,000. In turn, state residents who meet certain income requirements can qualify for up to $9,500 in incentives, depending on the type of vehicle. The new law will also usher in the state’s first electric bike voucher program. Dykes said the first public meeting was held this week to gather input on how to design the initiative. Additionally, the state agency has begun crafting a plan for distributing $20 million for electric school buses – spending that’s expected to trigger federal funding, as well. Meanwhile, the state is making up to $4 million available to public and private entities to purchase and install light-duty charting stations. The funding came from a 2018 settlement between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Members of the local Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape tribe gathered with other Indigenous peoples from the region to hold a powwow in the atrium of the Delaware Art Museum. Non-native people were invited to attend and, in some cases, participate in the cultural celebration. They were also encouraged to support local Indigenous artists who came to sell jewelry, shawls, bags and even bows and arrows. “This is not something to exploit,” said Iz Balleto, community engagement specialist at the museum. “We just wanted to build that bridge with the tribes that have been forgotten here in Delaware.” Social powwows are important to Indigenous peoples, Nanticoke Chief Natosha Carmine said. They’re an opportunity to see family and friends, as well as to provide education on their tribe’s history and customs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health said appointments have been made available to 5,500 people on a waiting list for the monkeypox vaccine, WUSA-TV reported. Before that announcement, DC Health said it received 8,300 doses of the JYENNOS vaccine and administered approximately 2,600. “Individuals will have 48 hours to claim their appointment,” DC Health tweeted at 10:14 a.m. Saturday. “Residents who did not receive an appointment invitation (last) week will stay in the system until an appointment becomes available.” According to CDC data last updated on Friday, there are 110 monkeypox cases in D.C., the highest number per capita in the U.S. D.C. makes up about 6% of the monkeypox cases across the United States, averaging about eight new cases a day.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Jon Auvil defeated 124 other contestants Saturday night to win the annual Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike Contest at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West establishment where the author was a regular patron during his decadelong residence on the island in the 1930s. The look-a-like contest is a highlight of Key West’s annual Hemingway Days celebration, which ended Sunday. Auvil said he shares Hemingway’s passion for fishing, has written some fiction and would like to do more writing. “Every man wants to write like Hemingway,” said Auvil, who lives in Dade City, Florida, northeast of Tampa. While living in Key West, Hemingway wrote classics, including “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “To Have and Have Not.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Police are investigating a late-night vehicle accident at Ellis Square that injured five people Saturday. A few minutes before 8 p.m., an elderly man accidentally drove his four-door Ford F-150 truck onto the square, police said. About 9 p.m., police arrived at the scene and found five people injured – two adult pedestrians with serious injuries and two juveniles with nonlife-threatening injuries. One person refused emergency services care. The four injured people were transported to Memorial University Medical Center, according to Chatham Emergency Services. Ellis Square is a popular spot for both tourists and residents visiting the restaurants, bars and clubs along City Market and Congress Street.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An active-duty U.S. Marine accused in the stabbing death of his wife is in custody and facing a second-degree murder charge. The Honolulu Police Department said Saturday that Bryant Tejeda-Castillo was being held on $1 million bail. Police said he was captured shortly after the Wednesday killing of 27-year-old Dana Alotaibi along a freeway. Police said he was taken to the Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu with what one witness said were several self-inflicted wounds. Alotaibi’s friends said she was pregnant, but police said they are awaiting autopsy results. A police spokesman on Saturday said he didn’t know if Tejeda-Castillo remained at the hospital or had been transferred elsewhere. Tejeda-Castillo was arrested on a warrant of second-degree murder.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will spend $1 million to fight illegal fentanyl use and resulting overdose deaths, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said he will likely recommend additional money in his budget that will be considered by lawmakers early next year. But he said urgent action is needed now for the fentanyl problem that law enforcement officials said can spur property crimes, as well as crimes against individuals. The money will be used for testing equipment to increase the ability of police to find fentanyl. It will also be used for a media campaign to alert Idaho residents to the dangers of fentanyl, a cheap but potent synthetic opioid that has been behind a major increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. It has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, leading to overdose deaths. As little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal. The drug is 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: The National Weather Service confirmed a small tornado touched down in suburban Chicago. Snapped trees and minor damage to roofs in Naperville were reported Saturday, meteorologist Todd Kluber said. The tornado touched down about 5:40 a.m. and was part of thunderstorms that rolled through the Chicago area overnight. Wind gusts reached 58 mph at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Kluber said. Multiple gas leaks in a Naperville commercial building also were reported and about 250 utility customers temporarily lost power, the city said in a release. About a dozen roads were blocked by fallen trees or branches. No injuries were reported.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be in Indianapolis on Monday for the start of the General Assembly’s special session to debate a near-total ban on abortion. Harris’s office confirmed to the Indianapolis Star on Friday the vice president would “meet with state legislators and leaders to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights” on the first day of the special session in a roundtable discussion. Senate Republicans have proposed banning abortions in the state, except in cases of rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or when the fetus has a fatal anomaly. Should it pass, it would make Indiana home to one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Seven other states ban abortion at zero weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Hallie Koenigs, a 4-year-old cancer patient from Riceville, was gifted a pink boat in front of the Make-A-Wish Iowa office in Urbandale. Koenigs loves fishing, and goes on a fishing trip every August with her siblings and parents, Allen and Kacie. The project came together with the help of many community members, including a volunteer who traveled to the upper peninsula of Michigan to pick up the boat, Vision Signs, which provided the custom pink vinyl, and Scheels, which provided Hallie with all the fishing gear she would need.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The Shawnee County Commission accepted RailWorks Track Services’ $129,000 bid to make repairs and improvements to the Gage Park mini-train tracks, ties and culverts damaged by severe thunderstorms. The money will come from the building maintenance fund. Repairs include railroad ties, spikes, rails, ballasts and soil work.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear will miss next month’s Fancy Farm picnic for the second straight year. Beshear said in a social media post Friday that he and his wife, first lady Britainy Beshear, will visit Israel in August. The governor said the trip will conflict with the annual political picnic in western Kentucky, which this year falls on Aug. 6. Democrats are expected to be scarce at this year’s picnic, with Republicans dominating most state and federal offices. U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker is the only Democrat who has committed to attend. Kentucky’s two Republican U.S. senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, have not yet committed to attending the picnic. Paul is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate and will face Booker in the fall. The picnic – also known for its barbecue – draws large crowds and is a rite of passage for statewide candidates in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Teachers of English, math, science and social studies are eligible for a $7,500 hiring bonus in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. The move came as the system continues to struggle to staff schools for the upcoming year. On Thursday, the district reported 233 vacant positions, 110 of which were in the core subject areas, The Advocate reported. “This proposal will give us a competitive edge against neighboring parishes offering similar sign-on bonuses,” Nichola Hall, chief human resources officer, wrote in a memo. Hall said the bonus will go only to teachers hired between May 24 and Aug. 5. To be eligible, in addition to teaching in a core subject, the teachers must have a current teaching license and commit in writing to stay with the school system for three years. The parish School Board on Thursday voted 7-1 in favor of the new hiring bonus. The school system is proposing spending almost $1.1 million for the bonuses, which will cover more than 100 teachers. The funding will come from federal COVID-19 relief money.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine-based sporting goods chain that once had more than 200 stores on the East Coast is shuttering its remaining 35 stores. Olympia Sports confirmed the stores would close by the end of September and that liquidation sales had begun at all locations. Olympia Sports was founded in 1975 by Edward Manganello, who opened his first store at the Maine Mall in South Portland. By 2013, it had 226 locations from Maine to Virginia, the Portland Press Herald reported. Denver-based running and active lifestyle brand JackRabbit bought the company in 2019. JackRabbit, owned by a private equity firm, was sold in December to North Carolina-based Fleet Feet. An email to Fleet Feet on Saturday was not immediately returned.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he won’t support the GOP gubernatorial nominee, Dan Cox, whom he once again described as a “Q-Anon” whack job.” Hogan blamed the Democratic Governors Association and former President Donald Trump for Cox’s victory in Tuesday’s primary over Kelly Schulz, who was a cabinet secretary in Hogan’s administration. The DGA spent large amounts of money on ads that described Cox as “too conservative for Maryland” and highlighted his connections to Trump – ads that might well have bolstered Cox’s appeal to GOP primary voters. Hogan, who appeared Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” said Cox’s victory is “a win for the Democrats” because Cox has no chance of defeating Democratic nominee Wes Moore in November in a state where Democrats have a huge natural advantage. Although Hogan said he won’t vote for Cox, he said he’s unsure if he will vote for Moore.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton is calling for changes in the way the Boston-area public transit system operates after a fire on a train prompted one passenger to jump into a river and others to scramble out of windows. No one was injured Thursday morning when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s inbound Orange Line train caught fire while on a bridge crossing the Mystic River just north of Boston on approach to the Assembly station in Somerville. The fire appears to have been caused by a metal panel on the train’s base that came loose and touched the electrified third rail, the system’s general manager said. Moulton told WCVB-TV on Friday that “it’s a total embarrassment and “we’ve got to change it.” Moulton, a member of the House transportation committee, said he doesn’t want the federal government to have to take over. The 43-year-old train car that caught fire had been inspected less than a month ago, which included an inspection of the panel that came loose, according to the MBTA. After the fire, the same panel on every other in-service Orange Line car was inspected, and no issues were found, the agency said. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The practice of fingerprinting people without probable cause or a warrant is unconstitutional, the Michigan Supreme Court said Friday. The court unanimously said Grand Rapids police violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. “The fingerprinting of each of the plaintiffs in these cases constituted a physical trespass onto a person’s body, a constitutionally protected area,” Justice Richard Bernstein wrote. The incidents involved two Black teenagers in 2011 and 2012, though the American Civil Liberties Union said photos and fingerprints were taken from thousands of people in Grand Rapids. The city has dropped the practice, but defended fingerprinting as a way to determine someone’s identity when they had no identification. Police also took photos.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Xcel Energy has started gathering public input on its plan to build one of the state’s largest transmission line projects in recent years. The utility company has proposed building a 140-mile power line that would run from Becker in the north to Lyon County to the south. The $500 million line would connect several new renewable energy projects. “The purpose of this line is to unlock renewable energy from a very renewable rich jurisdiction – wind and solar both,” said Michael Lamb, Xcel’s senior vice president for transmission. If the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approves the project, Lamb estimated it would be completed by 2027 to 2028. The regulatory, engineering and construction process for a large new power line is lengthy. This week, Xcel started contacting landowners, local governments, environmental groups and others impacted by the power line to get their input before determining the line’s final route.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A park by a central Mississippi reservoir will be named for Bobby Cleveland, a longtime outdoors writer who promoted events there after he retired from journalism. The governing board for the Ross Barnett Reservoir has voted unanimously that Lakeshore Park will become the Bobby Cleveland Park at Lakeshore, the Clarion Ledger reported. “He was a very devoted champion of the reservoir,” general manager John Sigman said of Cleveland. The park is in Rankin County, a few miles northwest of Jackson. Cleveland, 67, died after a traffic accident April 28 as he was leaving the park. His memorial service was held there days later. The Hattiesburg native was well-known in Mississippi for his decades as the outdoors writer for the Clarion Ledger. Cleveland lived near the reservoir and fished in it often. After he left the newspaper in 2012, be became the spokesman for the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, the state agency that manages the reservoir. Sigman said the request to rename the park was presented by the Barnett Reservoir Foundation, an organization for which Cleveland had been secretary.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Community members again are urging the City Council to take action on getting the city to use 100% renewable resources for energy production by 2030. The appeal was made last week during a City Council meeting at which the 2022 Columbia Water and Light Renewable Energy Plan report was accepted following a public hearing. A petition with nearly 3,000 signatures was delivered in May to the council requesting it ramp up renewable energy efforts. Among speakers Monday was Carolyn Amparan of the CoMO 100% by 2030 Coalition and the Sierra Club, who helped deliver the petitions in May. “We keep missing the targets,” Amparan said about renewable energy capacity goals by the city. “We shouldn’t just plan to make exactly 15% or 25%.” Other speakers urged the city to negotiate more renewable energy contracts and get out from its coal-powered plant contracts.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal lawsuit has been filed against the Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligation to provide adequate law enforcement services on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Billings argued the federal government does not provide enough federal law enforcement officers, drug investigators, missing persons investigators or jail space, even though violent crime has increased on the reservation, The Billings Gazette reported. “Public safety on-reservation is severely compromised due to the lack of meaningful BIA law enforcement presence in our communities,” Northern Cheyenne Tribe President Serena Wetherelt said in a statement. The officers also lack of understanding of tribal and federal law, which leads to suspects not being charged or prosecuted, the lawsuit said. Reports of violent crime on the reservation increased 50% from 2019 to 2020 and does not include crimes that went unreported, the lawsuit said. The Interior Department declined Friday to comment about the lawsuit, spokesperson Tyler Cherry said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Attorney General Doug Peterson said he will not file criminal charges against fellow Republican and former state lawmaker Mike Groene over photos the ex-lawmaker surreptitiously took of an aide. There is not enough information from the results of a State Patrol investigation to warrant criminal charges against Groene, a spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said Thursday. Groene, of North Platte, resigned from office earlier this year after acknowledging he photographed his legislative aide in his office without her knowledge. The former staffer, Kristina Konecko, said in a complaint to the Legislature’s Executive Board she discovered the photos on Groene’s laptop, which he had given her to update. She said some of the photos included close-ups of body parts. Groene, a blunt-spoken, often abrasive Republican who clashed with Democratic colleagues, also ended his candidacy to become a University of Nebraska Regent after the scandal came to light.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state posted record job numbers last month that showed several key industries have risen above their pre-pandemic employment levels. The record of 1,452,600 jobs was 3,000 more than the previous peak in February 2020. Nevada added 7,600 jobs last month. The employment numbers were announced Friday by Gov. Steve Sisolak, who said in a statement the state had recovered “all of the jobs that were lost during the COVID pandemic, and doing so in a way that has more Nevadans working in better-paying jobs than before the pandemic.” The Las Vegas Review Journal reported the state’s leisure and hospitality sector, which includes casinos, is still lagging behind at 90.7% of its pre-pandemic peak. But other industries have risen above their previous peaks to pull the rest of the state up. Nevada’s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% but remains one of the worst in the country.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed seven bills into law last week, including a Senate bill designed to require health care facilities to implement and maintain workplace violence prevention programs and establish a health care workplace safety commission, according to his office. Lawmakers began working to create the new requirements after the death of a hospital security guard who was assaulted at work in December 2020. Richard Semo, 64, of Farmington died from injuries sustained in an attack in the parking lot of Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester. The man who attacked him pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in 2021. Sununu held a bill signing Friday outside the hospital. Tim Jones, chief executive officer of Frisbie Memorial Hospital, spoke about Semo. Jones also told the governor that health care workers deal with abuse far too often, and there has been an increase in verbal and physical assaults nationwide during the pandemic, according to the Fosters Daily Democrat. Health facilities that are considered urgent care centers must comply with the new state requirement by July 1, 2024.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices are continuing their summertime slide with double-digit reductions in New Jersey amid a decline in demand and a drop in oil prices. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.51, down 12 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.17 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.41, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.15 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. Analysts said “global economic headwinds” are pushing oil prices down and U.S. drivers “are fueling up less despite this being the height of the traditional summer driving season.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: City commissioners took a step toward saving the lives of unwanted newborns at a recent meeting by voting to install a baby box. The vote was spurred by the case of Alexis Avila, who was caught on surveillance camera in early January throwing her infant – who was tied in a plastic bag – into a dumpster behind a retail shopping mall in near-freezing weather. Dumpster divers found the newborn – six hours later, and still alive. Because of that incident, commissioners approved a resolution in support of installing a surrender safety device at Hobbs Fire Station 1, otherwise known as the “Safe Haven Site,” and authorizing the city to seek funding for the installation and maintenance of the device from the state. Commissioners in February had made amendments to the Hobbs Safe Haven for Infants Act, the Hobbs News-Sun reported. Those changes allowed for the surrendering of infants, 90 days or less in age, to be surrendered via a “safety device” or “baby box” without parental fear of criminal prosecution. According to Hobbs Fire Chief Barry Young, the Safe Haven baby box is a much needed asset for Hobbs and surrounding areas.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester:A man accused of attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during a recent campaign rally told investigators he had been drinking that day and didn’t know who the congressman was, authorities said as the man was arrested on a federal assault charge Saturday. David Jakubonis, 43, made an initial court appearance Saturday before a federal magistrate judge in Rochester on a single count of assaulting a member of Congress with a dangerous weapon. The charge carries a potential maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was ordered held until a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday. Prosecutors said he should remain detained as a flight risk and is dangerous, according to a court filing. Assistant federal public defender Steven Slawinski, representing Jakubonis, said in an email to The Associated Press he planned to ask the judge to release Jakubonis from custody. Jakubonis was arraigned Friday on a separate state charge of attempted assault in the second degree and was released by a local judge. That prompted criticism from Zeldin and other Republicans who held it up as an example of the need to reform New York’s bail laws, something Zeldin has called upon Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to toughen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKenly: The city’s police force has resigned over what it called a hostile work environment. Police Chief Josh Gibson said he and four other officers turned in their two-week notices late Wednesday afternoon, news outlets reported. Gibson said utilities clerk Christy Jones and assistant town manager Sharon Evans also resigned. WRAL reported the police force usually has eight officers, but only had five on the force when the resignations occurred. Gibson, who had been with the department for 21 years, said officers couldn’t perform their duties because of the environment that was created by town manager Justine Jones, who took the job at the beginning of June. In their resignation letters, the employees cited a “hostile,” “toxic” and stressful work environment. Jones declined comment on the resignations. Kenly, with a population of approximately 2,400, is about 45 miles southeast of Raleigh.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has renewed its request to throw out a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that alleged the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The state said in court papers filed Thursday it denies allegations by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe. U.S. District Judge Peter Welte dismissed the state’s argument earlier this month that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. The Republican-controlled Legislature during its special session last fall approved a new map of legislative districts, based on updated census data. The map includes new House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argued the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the nonreservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleged the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. The case could go to trial next year if no resolution is reached, according to court filings.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A project to improve electric power capacity is underway on the city’s south side, near the future site of a Google data center. Known as the Parsons Avenue Transmission Project, the endeavor is aimed at improving electrical service for area residents and upcoming development, according to an American Electric Power Outreach Specialist Brian Recker, who added the project will benefit residents and a “future AEP customer” coming to the area, but he would not name the customer. Two substations, one of them new, will be located just north of a $300 million Google data center being built on a portion of the former Hartman Farm, located on the east of South High Street, south of Rathmell Road, west of Parsons Avenue and north of nearby Scioto Downs. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and employ 20 people.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahoma County’s $260 million bond package is supposed to help fund a new sheriff’s office in addition to a new jail facility, according to the ballot language and information from county officials, but the sale of the current office is on hold because of contract issues. Financing for the new sheriff’s office came through proceeds from the sale of the current building paired with a portion of the recently passed bond package. District 2 Commissioner Brian Maughan said the project won’t affect the ability to finance the new jail because the county will still be able to shift funds around from its general budget once it is able to apply federal COVID-19 relief funds to other projects.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland State University announced a tuition discount for any student from a federally recognized Native American tribe. Starting this fall, students who are members of the country’s nearly 600 federally recognized tribes across the country will receive in-state tuition, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. PSU noted in its announcement that it already offers support for students from Indigenous backgrounds including scholarships, programs and student groups through its Native American Student and Community Center. The discounted tuition will be offered starting this fall term to students who can provide their official tribal residency documentation to PSU. The university does not require any other information to be considered for the discount. The difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is roughly $420 per credit hour or about $19,000 per academic year for students enrolled in 15 credits, according to PSU.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state trooper has been charged with felony animal cruelty after hitting a loose horse with a patrol vehicle multiple times and pinning it to the pavement, where it was then euthanized, authorities said Friday. Cpl. Michael Perillo was suspended without pay after the charges were filed by the state police internal affairs division, officials announced. His bail was set at $50,000 during his arraignment Friday on two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and one count of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor. It is not known whether he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. A message left Friday for the union that represents troopers, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, was not immediately returned. Perillo responded to a call to police Dec. 28 involving a horse on a highway in Chester County, west of Philadelphia. The horse was on the road’s shoulder in Lower Oxford Township and had been struck by a motorist before troopers were sent, authorities said. Perillo drove a vehicle into the horse multiple times, causing it to fall, and then pinned the horse to the road, authorities said. Another trooper then euthanized it. Perillo, who enlisted in the state police in September 2006, is assigned to Troop J in Avondale.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin is naming two politicians who will be leaders on issues affecting Americans with disabilities as he prepares to retire from Congress. Langevin is holding an event Tuesday in Washington to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, speak about the need for accessible transportation and name two new co-chairs of the House Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus. Langevin led the caucus with Republican co-chair and longtime Alaska congressman Don Young, who died in March. Langevin isn’t seeking a 12th term. Langevin, the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, worked to create the caucus shortly after he got to Congress in 2001. Caucus members educate their colleagues and staff on issues affecting Americans with disabilities and their families, and work to ensure access to health care, housing, transportation, employment opportunities and disability benefits. Langevin said he is waiting until the event to announce the names.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The U.S. Senate confirmed Adair Ford Boroughs, a former congressional candidate and Columbia lawyer, to become the top federal prosecutor for South Carolina. The Senate approved the nomination by a voice vote of Ford Boroughs on Thursday as the state’s U.S. attorney. After the vote, Ford Boroughs tweeted, “I’m very excited to return to (the) DOJ and to work with an incredible team at the U.S. Attorney’s office.” President Joe Biden nominated Ford Boroughs, 42, for the position in June. Ford Boroughs’ nomination was quickly advanced by a Senate panel on July 14 with just two members – Missouri Republican Josh Hawley and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn – opposed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The sister of a St. Louis man who died while hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota said he was camping as part of a trip to celebrate graduating from college and got lost trying to find his way back to his car. The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office tweeted that 22-year-old Maxwell Right collapsed on an unmarked trail in Badlands National Park on Wednesday. He and a friend who was traveling with him had run out of water, according to the tweet. Temperatures in the Badlands had been approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the first half of the week. Right’s sister, Lucille, said the National Park Service told the family that her brother died surrounded by rangers. Authorities have not identified his friend, who the sheriff’s office said was flown to a Rapid City hospital and placed under observation for exposure and dehydration. The sheriff’s office initially said in its tweet that the unmarked trail has been featured in a social media challenge, but later said the men were simply following a trail on a hiking app. Lucille Right said her brother and his friend weren’t taking part in any social media challenge, saying they were on a larger trip to celebrate Maxwell graduating from Missouri S&T and had planned to visit Mt. Rushmore on Wednesday night.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Four inmates who escaped from the Silverdale Detention Center have been captured, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. Officers discovered the inmates were missing during a headcount early Saturday in a minimum security housing unit, media outlets reported. The facility was placed on lockdown and officials determined the missing inmates had breached an exterior door and scaled the perimeter barbed wire fence. Two of the inmates, Johnny Bryant and William Atkins, were captured within a few hours at a motel, the sheriff’s office said. Hours after authorities requested the public’s help to locate Justin Lynn Conner and Trevor Lynn Hall, both inmates were taken into custody. Conner was found in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee, and Hall was found in Jackson County, Tennessee. Among the charges that Bryant and Atkins face include resisting arrest and felony escape. Conner faces charges that include possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine for resale/manufacturing, use of stolen plates, theft of property, criminal impersonation, theft of property over $2,500 and misdemeanor evading. Hall faces the following charges: contraband in a penal institution, evading arrest, theft of property and felony escape.\n\nTexas\n\nBig Bend National Park: Authorities said a 75-year-old Houston man died while hiking alone last week at Big Bend National Park. The body of the man was found Thursday about a half-mile from the start of a trail, according to Park Deputy Superintendent David Elkowitz. The man’s name was not immediately released by authorities. Officials were still trying to determine a cause of death but summer heat at the park can be extreme. On Thursday afternoon, temperatures along the trail where the man’s body was found exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials at the national park in west Texas said hikers need to be mindful of the dangers from the extreme heat and they should be prepared to carry and drink one gallon of water per day and should be off desert trails by noon.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A wildfire sparked by lightning near the Utah-Nevada border late Thursday grew to nearly 6,000 acres on Friday, driven by winds and dry conditions into Washington County and sending a plume of smoke over much of the surrounding area. The fire was first reported just before 3 p.m. Thursday, about 25 miles southeast of Caliente, Nev. It burned quickly toward the north and the east on Friday, moving into heavier vegetation in the Docs Pass wilderness area, according to the Eastern Nevada Interagency Fire group. No structures or private property were threatened as of late Friday. More than 150 Firefighters were assigned, along with several fire engines, bulldozers and other equipment, with aerial support from multiple heavy air tankers and a helicopter. The fire was 5% contained as of late Friday afternoon.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 42-year-old Nevada man pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Burlington for his role in helping arrange the kidnapping and murder of a Vermont man stemming from a financial dispute. Aron Lee Ethridge is one of four men who have been charged in the kidnapping of Gregory Davis from his Danville home Jan. 6, 2018. Davis was found shot to death in a snowbank the next day. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors and Ethridge’s defense attorney agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 27 years or less. The actual sentence, scheduled for December, will be up to the judge. Ethridge could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said Ethridge arranged for Jerry Banks, 34, of Fort Garland, Colorado, to kidnap and then kill Davis. Banks allegedly called Ethridge the day after the kidnapping to inform him that Davis had been successfully kidnapped and killed. Banks has only been charged with kidnapping, but prosecutors alleged he killed Davis. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held pending trial.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Bodycam videos, police reports and other materials connected to the city’s aggressive response to protesters in June 2020 have been made public through the Library of Virginia. The database that went live recently is part of a legal settlement between the city and plaintiffs who said police used excessive force against protesters who gathered at the Robert E. Lee statue two years ago in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew. The department later apologized and said the use of tear gas was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned. Thomas H. Roberts, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs, said the archive will allow the public to judge for themselves how police responded. Members of the public will be able to contribute their own footage of what occurred to the archive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Authorities on Sunday issued an excessive heat watch for the Pacific Northwest region for coming days as potential record-breaking temperatures were forecast to settle in and linger until next weekend. Temperatures could break daily records in Seattle and other areas by Tuesday, potentially reaching their highest levels since last year’s heat wave that killed hundreds of people across the Pacific Northwest. Highs ranging from 95 to 110 were forecast for inland areas. An excessive heat watch was issued for central and eastern Washington state and the central Idaho Panhandle from Tuesday morning through Friday night.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office will be closed for sanitation Monday through Wednesday after staff tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Friday. The Vital Registration Office is the state’s official repository of birth, death, marriage and divorce records. The state plans to reopen the Charleston office on Thursday, a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources spokesperson said in a news release. Meanwhile, residents can go to their county clerk’s office to access certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, state officials said. Records can also be requested by mail or online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, the leader of the Assembly elections committee, is calling for her colleagues to decertify President Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020, a move that prompted her counterpart in the Senate to call for her removal. Brandtjen, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year, said Friday she was joining Republican candidate for governor Tim Ramthun’s push to overturn the last presidential election because “tyranny is at Wisconsin’s door.” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington has rejected such calls to do so. A spokeswoman for Vos did not answer whether Brandtjen, whom he appointed as chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, should continue to lead the panel. Sen. Kathy Bernier, R-Chippewa Falls, the chair of the Senate’s elections committee, said Brandtjen should be removed or step down from the committee. Bernier said the continued focus on 2020 through such claims hurts voter confidence needlessly.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Most abortions will become illegal in Wyoming on Wednesday after Gov. Mark Gordon gave the go-ahead Friday under a new state law. The law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. The Wyoming Legislature approved the ban and Gordon signed it into law in March in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade. That happened June 24, kicking off a review by Attorney General Bridget Hill to make sure Wyoming’s law conforms to the Supreme Court ruling. Gordon certified the law to the Secretary of State’s Office after Hill completed her almost four-week review Thursday. “I believe that the decision to regulate abortion is properly left to the states,” Gordon said in a statement. “As a pro-life governor, my focus will continue to be on ensuring we are doing all we can to support Wyoming mothers, children and families.” Wyoming currently allows abortions until a fetus can survive outside its mother’s body, generally around 23 weeks. Wyoming has no abortion clinics but the procedure still occurs in other medical settings, with 98 in the state reported to the Wyoming Department of Health in 2021, up from 91 in 2020. The abortion ban will have an “immediate and devastating” effect on those in Wyoming who can become pregnant, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. Organizers of a planned women’s health and abortion clinic in Casper have said they might contest the state abortion ban in court. An arson attack in May delayed the clinic’s expected mid-June opening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/11/native-hawaiian-princess-beer-bandits-flaming-hand-sanitizer-news-around-states/111414226/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: The Birmingham Zoo said in a news release that Parker, a 4-year-old male red panda, was found dead Sunday morning. There was no sign of physical injuries or illness and an examination didn’t immediately reveal the cause of death, the zoo said, adding that more test results were pending. There were no signs of illness in its other red panda, a 9-year-old female named Sorrel, the zoo said. Red pandas, much smaller than black and white pandas, grow to about the size of large house cats, with long bushy tails. The International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Wildlife Fund list the red panda, which is native to Asia, as an endangered species.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Recall Dunleavy, a group attempting to remove Gov. Mike Dunleavy from office, said Monday it had gathered 21,678 signatures of registered Alaska voters, 30% of the 71,252 needed to force a special election. Campaign Manager Claire Pywell did not provide timing for when the campaign hopes to have all of the signatures it needs. If the group turns sufficient signatures before April 19, the state would call a special election rather than placing the recall vote on the Aug. 18 statewide primary ballot. The group’s signature target is above 71,252 because it wants a buffer in case some signatures are ruled invalid, Pywell said. The recall organizers gathered 46,405 valid signatures over five weeks to apply for the recall. The Alaska Supreme Court is scheduled to consider the legality of the recall March 25. The recall effort group was scheduled to submit a written argument to the court Monday. Grounds for recall in Alaska are lack of fitness, incompetence, neglect of duties or corruption. The recall group is not alleging corruption. Cynthia Henry, chair of the Keep Dunleavy group opposing the recall effort, said by text message that her group is “staying the course to support the governor and oppose the recall.”\n\nArizona\n\nNogales:U.S. Border Patrol agents arrested a man near Nogales who had been previously deported, authorities said. Tucson Sector agents who were patrolling the desert arrested 44-year-old Noel Montes-Lopez, a Mexican national, on Saturday night, according to a press release from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. According to border authorities, Montes-Lopez pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in Monmouth County, New Jersey, in September 2010. He was convicted of beating and strangling his girlfriend in the home they shared in April 2009, according to NJ.com. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison and ordered to be removed from the country in June 2019, authorities said. Montez-Lopez faces federal prosecution for criminal immigration violations, Customs officials said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Department of Human Services is requesting double-digit pay increases for direct-care workers at state institutions for the developmentally disabled in hopes of retaining the employees. The department’s proposal includes five human development centers where pay would increase about 18%, from $22,000 to $26,034, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. Pay for supervisors would also increase almost 12%. Currently, direct-care and support staff members all make the same starting pay. Part of the proposal would also offer free training for all employees to become certified nursing assistants and require the direct-care staff members from all five centers to achieve the certification by the end of the year. The proposed changes in salary increase are in hopes to reduce the annual turnover that averages more than 100% across the five centers, said Melissa Stone, director of the department’s Division of Developmental Disabilities Services. The turnover also affects patients as they need consistent staff to know and be familiar with their needs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles:Much-needed rain fell across Southern California on Tuesday but in lighter amounts than originally forecast for the region, which has experienced a dry winter. San Diego County mountains already had received an inch of rain before dawn but generally the precipitation was showery rather than steady, and the National Weather Service adjusted expected totals downward. “Slow start to the storm this morning,” the Los Angeles-area weather office tweeted. The rain was being caused by a low pressure system off the coast of Southern California and Baja California that was drawing a plume of subtropical moisture northward, meteorologists said. Showers were expected to increase as the low approached but satellite imagery showed the atmospheric river was carrying most of the moisture into Baja California. Despite the reduced rainfall expectations, forecasters cautioned that potentially strong thunderstorms, and potential roadway flooding and debris flows from burn areas, were a possibility through the day from Los Angeles County and up the Central Coast to San Luis Obispo. North of the Los Angeles region, a flash flood watch was also in effect for the mountains and desert of Kern County, and a winter weather advisory was issued for a small portion of the southern Sierra Nevada.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s mountain snow measured slightly higher than usual for this time of year, boosting confidence that water for crops, cattle and residents will be adequate. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Colorado Snow Survey data showed the statewide snowpack at 106% of the norm between 1981 and 2010, The Denver Post reported. There is a significant variation between snow levels in the state’s northern and southern mountains, which has been a trend over the past decade. Forecasters anticipated that dry soil from last year’s warm, arid fall likely will reduce water in streams and rivers once snow melts. Snowpack in Colorado’s high mountains serves as a natural reservoir, holding water until spring when rising temperatures melt snow and send water into streams and rivers. The survey found Southwestern Colorado faced drier conditions with snowpack between 86% and 94% of the norm. Snowpack was calculated at 124% of the norm in the South Platte River Basin, 114% in the Upper Colorado River Basin and 109% in the Arkansas River Basin, the main water sources for Denver, Colorado Springs and northern Front Range cities.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A woman accused of starting an apartment building fire that left a man dead and dozens of residents injured sparked the blaze by throwing a flaming bottle of hand sanitizer at her girlfriend during an argument, police said Monday. Destiny Waite, 28, was charged with felony murder, arson and assault in connection with the fire in Hartford on early Sunday morning. Her attorney denied the allegations and accused Waite’s girlfriend of starting the fire. The blaze at the five-story building was reported at about 1:20 a.m. Firefighters rescued 41 people, and 31 residents were taken to local hospitals, fire officials said. Three firefighters also were injured, but are expected to recover. More than 60 families were displaced, Mayor Luke Bronin said. Officials identified the person who died as Jerome Kyser, 50. The chief medical examiner’s office determined the cause was smoke inhalation and ruled it a homicide. Waite was arraigned Monday in Superior Court, where a judge set her bail at $1 million. The city’s Health and Human Services agency opened a temporary shelter and was helping the families find other housing. The American Red Cross said it was helping 54 families, including 69 adults and nine children.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s congressional delegation is asking the secretary of the Air Force to visit Dover Air Force Base to address concerns about elevated levels of chemical contaminants in wells near the military installation. State environmental regulators were recently notified by base officials that two more wells near the base might have levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, above federal advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion. The notifications come after high levels of PFOS and PFOA were found in four other wells near the base last summer. Delaware’s congressional members said in a letter to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett on Monday that the two recent discoveries underscore the importance of Barrett or another senior Air Force official visiting Dover and briefing local residents and state officials. The Delaware delegation had sent a similar letter in July after test results indicated contaminants in water wells near the base. One of those wells had a PFOS level of 168,000 parts per trillion and a PFOA level of 2,460 parts per trillion, according to a document provided to The Associated Press. The Air Force is continuing to provide alternative water supply to those properties. The owners of the more recently tested wells, which provide water to a single commercial business, also are being provided bottled water.PFOA and PFOS are among a class of man-made compounds known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics, food packaging and, notably, firefighting foam that has been used at military bases across the country.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The D.C. government recently removed some rubber mats from playgrounds at district schools and parks after finding high levels of potentially toxic lead, WUSA-TV reported. Tests commissioned by the parental group D.C. Safe & Healthy Playing Fields released in May first revealed high lead levels at Janney Elementary School. Further parental complaints to the DC Council compelled the city’s Department of General Services to commission its own studies. Eighteen playgrounds identified as having lead levels above the acceptable levels of 400 parts per million have been vacuumed, pressure-washed, and reevaluated according to the report. The vacuuming efforts were able to collect and dispose of chunks of rubber that might be picked up and ingested. This reduced the lead hazards from ingestion of the loose PIP rubber chunks, according to the report.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: A SpaceX cargo ship arrived at the International Space Station on Monday, delivering the company’s 20th batch of gear and treats. The Dragon capsule reached the orbiting lab after launching late Friday night. NASA astronauts Andrew Morgan and Jessica Meir used the station’s robot arm to capture the spacecraft. The 4,300-pound shipment contains science experiments and equipment, as well as special goodies for the three-person crew aloft for months: grapefruit, tomatoes, Skittles, Reese’s Pieces and Hot Tamales. This is the last of SpaceX’s original-style Dragons. All future ones are designed to carry either cargo or crew, and will dock automatically rather than require robot-arm assistance. SpaceX has been sending up station cargo since 2012 and plans to start launching NASA astronauts this spring. From 260 miles up, Meir congratulated SpaceX on its many milestones, including the fact this is the third flight for this particular Dragon. Spacecraft and rocket recycling, she noted, is “the more sustainable approach that will be paramount to the future of spaceflight.” The Dragon will remain at the orbiting lab for a month before returning to Earth with science specimens.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State House Speaker David Ralston is backing a legislative proposal to set the state’s personal income tax at a flat rate of 5.375%. The General Assembly voted to cut the state’s top income tax rate from 6% to 5.75% in 2018, and a further cut to 5.5% was planned for this year. “In 2018, we promised Georgians meaningful tax relief, and this is the second step in delivering on that promise,” Ralston, a Republican from Blue Ridge, said in a statement. If passed by both chambers and signed into law, the proposal would go into effect Jan. 1. Its backers estimate that the proposal would save taxpayers in Georgia approximately $250 million a year. The proposal would institute a new income tax credit for working families meant to offset the flattening of Georgia’s tax brackets, according to the statement. It would also triple the adoption tax credit from $2,000 to $6,000, a plan earlier proposed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The legislation is sponsored by state Rep. Brett Harrell, a Republican from Snellville. Harrell is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A 93-year-old Native Hawaiian heiress doesn’t need anyone to handle her estate because she isn’t dead yet, she testified Monday during a hearing to determine whether she needs a conservator to oversee her $215 million trust. Abigail Kawananakoa’s fortune has been tied up in a court case since her 2017 stroke. Her longtime attorney, Jim Wright, argued the stroke left her impaired, and he stepped in to assume the role of trustee. Kawananakoa said she’s fine and fired Wright. She then married her partner of 20 years, Veronica Gail Worth, who later took her last name. Abigail Kawananakoa inherited her wealth as the great-granddaughter of James Campbell, an Irish businessman who made his fortune as a sugar plantation owner and one of Hawaii’s largest landowners. In the ongoing fight over her wealth, a judge last year ordered a hearing to determine whether she needs a conservator. Her attorney filed a motion saying that the hearing should be closed to the public. The Associated Press, Hawaii News Now and Honolulu Civil Beat argued against closing the hearing. A judge ruled that portions dealing with medical or financial information would be discussed behind closed doors. Native Hawaiians consider Kawananakoa a princess because she’s a descendant of the family that ruled the islands before the overthrow of the Hawaiian kingdom in 1893. They have been closely watching the legal wrangling over her trust because they are concerned about the fate of a foundation she set up to benefit Hawaiian causes. In 2018, a judge ruled Kawananakoa lacked the mental capacity to manage her trust, appointed First Hawaiian Bank to serve as trustee and removed Wright.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state moved closer to banning transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams sponsored by public schools, colleges and universities despite warnings that the measure could be unconstitutional and challenged in court. The Senate State Affairs Committee sent legislation to the full Senate, where it’s expected to be amended to address concerns about exams athletes could face to check their birth gender and to allow transgender opportunities to compete in ways that have not been yet made clear by lawmakers. The measure last month overwhelmingly passed in the Republican-led state House. Under the legislation, girls’ and women’s teams would not be open to students who were born male, even if they identify as female. Opponents have warned that the legislation discriminates against a marginalized community. Republican Sen. Mary Souza, a sponsor on the Senate side, said amendments to the bill could find a way for transgender athletes to compete. She did not elaborate, except to say that “having them taking the places of girls and women on girls’ and women’s teams is not something that we can condone,” she said. The lawmakers said allowing transgender athletes on girls’ and women’s teams would negate nearly 50 years of progress women have made since the 1972 federal legislation credited with opening up sports to female athletes. Legislation similar to the Idaho bill has been advancing in the Arizona Legislature, and Ehardt has said other states are considering following suit.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A sheriff’s office investigating the vaccination practices of a deceased Chicago-area pediatrician said that tests have revealed several of the doctor’s former patients lack immunity to diseases against which they or their parents believed they had been vaccinated. The Cook County Sheriff’s news release comes just weeks after the office announced an investigation into the medical records of Dr. Van Koinis, an Evergreen Park pediatrician who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in September. Authorities said Koinis left a suicide note that suggested he had followed parental requests not to vaccinate their children. At the time, Sheriff Tom Dart told reporters that Koinis was widely known as a doctor who would provide treatment for people opposed to vaccinations. In Monday’s release, Dart’s office said two former patients who are now adults and seven parents whose children were treated by Koinis learned they lack immunity to diseases they believed they had received vaccinations against. Investigators are trying to determine if Koinis forged records so parents who didn’t want their children to be vaccinated could get them into schools that require shots. But that would not explain why the results of testing varied even between siblings.“One child who was treated by Koinis is vaccinated while a sibling is undervaccinated or shows no evidence of vaccination,” the release said. Adding to the mystery is that some parents told investigators they witnessed the doctor administering the shots. The doctor acknowledged in his suicide note that his records after 2010 were not reliable, according to the release. Dart’s office said Koinis, whose body was found in a Cook County forest preserve, had been licensed to practice in Illinois since 1991.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie:City Hall was evacuated Tuesday morning after a white powder was observed in one of the building’s elevators and on the second and third floors. Shortly after noon, authorities said they had determined that substance posed no danger to employees. Two Muncie women arrested early Tuesday afternoon were accused of spreading the powder. Terri J. King and Sheila D. Cates – both 51 and of the 300 block of East Berkley Avenue – were preliminarily charged with intimidation. They at first tried to persuade investigators the powder “was used to stop the spread of the Coronavirus.” Police Chief Nathan Sloan said surveillance video showed King and Cates throwing the powder in the building. Tests were conducted confirmed the powder was not a deadly substance like anthrax and ricin. According to police investigators, King was recently evicted from a home and a city employee “was involved in the case.” King and Cates allegedly first went to that employee’s third-floor office on Tuesday and “spread the substance on and around the door.” King reportedly told police she and Cates had spread the substance on doors and stairwell railings “they knew employees would touch” in a bid to “rid the evil from the building and the people in it.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The City Council plans to work on defining racial profiling and collecting data before enacting an ordinance banning it. On Monday the council backed a proposed ordinance that would make racial profiling an “illegal discriminatory municipal practice” that could lead to a city employee being fired. It would back up the Police Department’s anti-discrimination policy. Some of the dozens of people who filled the council chamber held signs that read “Skin color is not a crime” and “Stop the stops.” The latter referred to pretextual stops in which officers stop someone for one reason but use it as cause to investigate something unrelated. The initial passage of the ordinance comes months after the city settled lawsuits with three black men who said Des Moines police officers racially profiled them.\n\nKansas\n\nGypsum: An 84-year-old man died when his golf cart rolled on top of him after it went into a ditch, Saline County authorities said. Frederick Meyer died Monday in the accident in southeast Saline County near Gypsum, The Salina Post reported. Meyer was driving his golf cart on his property to get his mail when it went into a ditch and overturned, Saline County Sheriff’s Lt. Jeremiah Hayes said. Meyer was thrown from the golf cart, which rolled on top of him, Hayes said. He died at the scene. A passerby noticed the golf cart in the ditch and called Meyer’s family, who found him and notified authorities.\n\nKentucky\n\nHazard: A food drive to help organizations feed the hungry in Appalachia is planned for next month. Kentucky Power said in a statement that it has partnered with WYMT-TV and other local businesses and agencies to hold Power Up the Pantry for a second time. Last year, the event collected 7.5 tons of food and more than $17,000 in monetary donations, the statement said. The daylong event is planned for April 3. Donations will benefit God’s Pantry Food Bank, which serves food pantries in eastern Kentucky, and Facing Hunger, which serves food pantries in northeastern Kentucky. “This year we are reaching out to more businesses to encourage them to join the effort by collecting goods from employees and customers,” Kentucky Power spokeswoman Cindy Wiseman said. “We are coming out of winter when food pantries historically have more requests and often face critical shortages of food and supplies.” One in six Kentucky residents struggles with hunger, according to God’s Pantry Executive Director Michael Halligan.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A Louisiana couple accused of swiping more than $1,000 worth of beer from the shelves of Target stores was arrested on theft charges Sunday, sheriff’s office records show. East Baton Rouge Sheriff’s deputies began investigating the beer burglaries last week, according to the agency. The couple made six runs to two Baton Rouge Target locations less than 10 miles apart between Feb. 24 and Feb. 29, according to sheriff’s office documents obtained by news outlets. Ashley Forbes, 32, and her husband, Matthew Forbes, 35, were captured on security cameras filling shopping baskets with cases of beer before slipping out of the stores without paying, The Advocate reported, citing the sheriff’s records. Authorities said the two were arrested Sunday after they attempted to steal additional merchandise from other stores, including a drill that Matthew Forbes tried to smuggle out in his pants at a Walmart, according to WBRZ-TV. Ashley Forbes was also reportedly caught returning items she hadn’t paid for at a Walmart, the station said. The two had been banned from similar stores previously, according to news outlets. The couple was booked into jail on theft charges, and Ashley Forbes also faces drug charges, records showed.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine’s apple growers are suffering because of the nation’s trade disputes and need help from the federal government, lawmakers from the state have told the head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Republican Sen. Susan Collins and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden called on agriculture secretary Sonny Perdue on March 4 to provide assistance to the state’s small growers of apples. They said the billions of dollars in agricultural aid provided by the administration of President Donald Trump has not found its way to Maine’s apple farmers. Collins and Golden said most apple farms in Maine are 15 acres or less. The state’s total acreage of apple farms has dipped from more than 3,330 in 2012 to about 2,670 in 2017, the most recent year with statistics available. The lawmakers added that it’s important for the administration to make aid available for small farms and orchards, as opposed to favoring the bigger operations.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Sports betting would be allowed at Maryland’s six casinos, horse racing tracks and potentially at a Washington Redskins stadium, under a measure the state Senate approved Tuesday. Senate voted 47-0 for the legislation, which now goes to the House. If the General Assembly approves the measure to allow wagering on professional and college sports, voters would have the final say in a November referendum. The measure would permit sports betting at either a renovated Redskins stadium, or a new stadium built nearby. Redskins owner Dan Snyder met with Maryland lawmakers in January to discuss allowing sports betting at a new stadium. The Redskins play in Landover, in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. Talks have been ongoing with Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia on a new stadium to replace FedEx Field when its lease expires in 2027. Sports betting could raise about $20 million a year for education in the state, according to state analysts. Democrats who control the legislature have been considering revenue measures to help pay for a far-reaching education proposal to improve schools that is expected to cost billions of dollars over the next decade. In addition to the state’s casinos, wagering would be allowed at horse racing tracks, including Pimlico Race Course, home to the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore, Laurel Park and the Maryland State Fair. Bets could be placed in a sports-wagering lounge, on a self-service kiosk or machine in a facility with a license or through online sports wagering by someone physically located in the state.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than 120 personal care attendants, who are paid by Massachusetts to assist people with disabilities, were registered sex offenders and thousands had criminal records, according to a state watchdog agency. The attendants, who help people with disabilities or chronic illnesses to maintain their independence, are paid for by the state’s Medicaid program, known as MassHealth, which allows its members to hire their own attendants and does not require background checks, the Boston Globe reported. According to a 2018 report released by Massachusetts Inspector General Glenn Cunha in February, almost 12,000 attendants had a criminal record from the last decade, 122 of whom were sex offenders. Bill Henning, executive director of the Boston Center for Independent Living, said the individual control the program allows is integral to its success, and that too many hiring requirements could interfere with its success. Paul Spooner, who used attendants for decades, said if MassHealth conducted background checks, that would “fundamentally alter” the program. MassHealth spokeswoman Jessica Lyons said in an email that the program “provides consumers with the tools to make safe and informed choices about who they hire, including educational materials and trainings on the importance of background checks.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRogers City: Wreckage from a freighter that sank in Lake Huron in 1905 has moved toward Michigan’s shoreline because of high water levels and waves, weakening the ruins further, officials said. The Joseph S. Fay was a ship that sank on Oct. 19, 1905. One side of the shipwreck had moved about 10 feet inland during a storm in October, said Eric Klein, caretaker of the 40 Mile Point Lighthouse. He added that it has since been pushed further inland following a series of storms and estimated it’s now about 25 feet from its original location near the lighthouse. Klein said the waves have damaged the shipwreck over time. “It’s basically eroding the wreck, and big pieces will come off and be washed away,” he said. Klein said the wreck can’t be protected because it’s illegal to move or remove shipwreck artifacts from the water. Wayne Lusardi, a state Maritime Archaeologist, said even though water levels in the Great Lakes fluctuate over time, it’s unusual that waves are exposing artifacts and shipwreck pieces that haven’t been seen in a while. Last year, sightings of wooden pieces of shipwrecks were common along Thunder Bay in Alpena and other communities.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: An aerial survey of Minnesota’s moose population showed that moose numbers have remained relatively stable for the ninth consecutive year, the Department of Natural Resources said. Still, the moose population is at risk in the long-term, as reproductive success remains low. This winter, the DNR estimated the moose population to be 3,150 animals, or range between 2,400 and 4,320. Because of the variance in this type of annual population estimate, this year’s estimate doesn’t suggest a decline from last year’s estimate of 4,180. The survey provided an estimate because biologists can’t see or count every moose across the 6,000-square-mile survey area. They survey a portion of the moose range every year to come up with an estimate. The DNR said the stability is good news, but Minnesota moose are still at risk. The moose population has declined from an estimated 8,840 in 2006. Low reproductive success and continued deaths from brainworm and other diseases make it difficult for the population to recover. The Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa and the 1854 Treaty Authority contributed funding and personnel for the annual survey.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:A body found Friday in Hattiesburg is believed to be that of a man police were looking for after shots allegedly were fired from a nearby home in February. Forrest County Deputy Coroner Lisa Klem identified the man as Jim Travis Rainey, 36, of Hattiesburg. Rainey’s body was found about 2 p.m. Friday in a wooded area behind a house on the 1900 block of Mamie Street as Hattiesburg police were following up on a missing person investigation. Officers were canvassing the area, where the person involved in the February incident was last seen, when they located Rainey’s body, said Hattiesburg Police Department spokesman Ryan Moores. Rainey was a suspect in the incident that occurred Feb. 27 in the 1900 block of Eva Street, where a person fired multiple shots from a residence, believing the individual was attempting to gain entry into the dwelling. The cause of Rainey’s death is pending autopsy results from the State Crime Lab and the shooting incident remains part of an ongoing investigation. Police also are looking for 19-year-old John Michael Weeks of Hattiesburg as part of the investigation. Anyone with information about the incident or Weeks’ whereabouts is asked to call Hattiesburg police at (601) 544-7900 or Metro Crime Stoppers at (601) 582-7867.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:A spokesman with the Missouri Attorney General’s Office told the News-Leader that the office would soon file suit against the “Jim Bakker Show” operation near Branson. Spokesman Chris Nuelle said in an email that the goal of the suit was “to stop (Bakker) from selling that coronavirus ‘cure.’ ” On Monday two federal agencies warned the televangelist to stop selling “silver sol” products that he and a show guest had promoted on air in February as capable of “eliminating” coronavirus from the human body in a matter of hours. Such claims fly in the face of scientific information handed down by public health authorities in Missouri, the federal government and the World Health Organization. At this time, there is no medication to treat coronavirus, but multiple vaccines are in development, a process that could take a year or more. Late last week, Bakker got a similar warning from the attorney general of New York state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Monday he will run against first-term Republican Sen. Steve Daines, giving Democrats a boost in their effort to take control of the Senate in November. His decision to run is an about-face made at the last minute for the two-term governor, who ended his long-shot bid for president in December and had repeatedly insisted he had no interest in running for the Senate. Democrats need to win four seats now held by Republicans, without losing any to win outright control of the Senate. If President Donald Trump is defeated, the Democrats would need a net gain of three seats and the vice-president’s tie-breaking vote for control. Bullock had come under increasing pressure to run since dropping his presidential bid, including meeting with former President Barack Obama in Washington. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer recently traveled to Montana to meet with Bullock. Four of the five other Democrats who had announced Senate bids dropped out by Monday night. Daines has the backing of Trump, for whom the state overwhelmingly voted in 2016. Trump has tweeted his support for Daines, who recently met with the Republican president at the White House.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorth Platte: Crews and vehicles from 14 departments and a crop-dusting plane kept a brush fire from destroying any structures or injuring anyone in Lincoln County, authorities said. The wind-blown flames blackened more than 3.1 square miles north of North Platte in a few hours Sunday. The first report was called in around 3:20 p.m., and officials said the blaze was contained by 6 p.m. Some firefighters remained to handle hot spots but left early Monday morning when rain began to fall. The crop-duster dropped water to slow the flames’ advance across the dry fields. Investigators found the fire’s flash point in an open field south of a rural subdivision that which sits east of the U.S. Highway 83-Nebraska Highway 97 junction. But the fire cause has yet to be determined, North Platte Battalion Chief Jeff Hankla said.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Eldorado Resorts is selling the Montbleu Resort Casino and Spa in Lake Tahoe as the gaming company continues to trim part of its portfolio in preparation for its acquisition of Caesars Entertainment. Eldorado announced the sale to Maverick Gaming on Tuesday. The regional gaming company was also the buyer for the Eldorado Shreveport Resort and Casino in Louisiana, which sold in January for $230 million. Eldorado did not provide a sale price for the Montbleu transaction, which is still subject to regulatory approval. The Montbleu sale is part of efforts by Eldorado to divest part of its regional gaming empire after it announced plans to acquire gaming giant Caesars for $17.3 billion. The Caesar’s deal is still going through the regulatory process, which includes gaining approval from various states and gaming control boards. “The agreement to divest Montbleu is consistent with our continued focus on the expected closing for the Caesars transaction in the first half of 2020,” said Eldorado CEO Tom Reeg in a prepared statement. Eldorado owns and operates 23 gaming properties in 11 states, including Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Mississippi and New Jersey.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nExeter: Firefighters fought brush fires in several New Hampshire towns, including one fire that came within feet of a home. Andre Baillargeon, an office administrator at the fire department in Exeter, told WMUR-TV she heard her own address announced as the spot of one of the fires Monday. She got there as the fire department did. Firefighters contained the brush fire, which left charred leaves spread nearly the length of a football field near her home. Firefighters also contained a nearly 3-acre fire in Rye on Monday afternoon. The cause of both fires remains under investigation. It’s early for brush fire season. Firefighters said it was dry, warm, and windy Monday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nRed Bank:“Sopranos” stars Michael Imperioli, Steve Schirripa and Vincent Pastore will reunite at Patrizia’s in Red Bank on April 2 at an event with Frank Sinatra tribute artist Michael Martocci that will benefit Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals.

Tuition will go up by 2.6%, according to Dan Garcia, president of the university’s enrollment management. Students from in the state will pay $200 more per semester. Out-of-state students will have to fork over an additional $600 per semester. Garcia said the increase is not related to a 4% raise for some employees or a 6% drop in enrollment. This decision comes after the university’s announcement last month that students from households making $50,000 or less could be eligible for free tuition their freshman year.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Police said two men in surgical masks stole nearly $260,000 at gunpoint from three workers at Aqueduct Racetrack. Workers were emptying gaming machines Saturday while preparing to close for the night. The three workers, including two unarmed security guards, were forced into a room by the two men wearing all black who took the workers’ cellphones before making off with the cash. The assailants used surgical masks to conceal their identity. The masks have become a more common sight recently because many people have taken to wearing them amid fears of the new coronavirus. Investigators believe the culprits work for the racetrack and are investigating some people who recently called out sick, The New York Times reported. Police said Monday that no arrests have been made.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nJacksonville: Eric Whitfield, who won a school board primary, has been fired from his job and asked to withdraw from the race because of a slur about black people that he posted on social media. Whitfield is one of four Republicans on the November ballot for the Onslow County Board of Education race. Whitfield posted the racially offensive comment last week on Facebook, using a controversial term referring to African Americans, news outlets reported. Whitfield made the comment on a post from Al Burgess, who is the former head of the local NAACP and a member of the Jacksonville Planning Advisory Board. Burgess’ post was discussing the nomination of Mark Robinson, who won the Republican nomination for North Carolina’s lieutenant governor. Burgess and Robinson are African American. Burgess said he isn’t sure why Whitfield took exception to his comments on Robinson. The post doesn’t appear to be on Burgess’ page anymore. Whitfield’s page has been taken down but a screenshot of the comment has been circulating since Thursday. He was an instructor at the Jacksonville Christian Academy but the private school confirmed his employment was terminated. Two sitting board members, Jeff Hudson and Bill Lanier, have asked Whitfield to withdraw from the race. Onslow County Republican Party Chairwoman Lee Barrows said Whitfield’s remarks do not represent the party. Whitfield said he would comment on the matter on March 10, which is also when the Onslow County Board of Education will have a regular meeting.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pharmacist has pleaded guilty to federal exploitation and cyberstalking charges. Curtis McGarvey, 52, is accused of using hidden cameras to record a female guest in his home. McGarvey told U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland that the first images he recorded were the result of a test of equipment to be used at his business, a pharmacy. McGarvey said he takes full responsibility for any subsequent images. He said the medication he was on for anxiety and depression took away his guilt for his actions The Bismarck Tribune said McGarvey faces a maximum of 30 years in prison on the two exploitation charges. Hovland accepted McGarvey’s pleas and ordered a presentence investigation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Attorney General Dave Yost said he has rejected the wording on a petition seeking to have voters decide in November whether to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. Yost said the summary language on the petition fails to include “findings and declarations” that are listed in the proposed constitutional amendment. Messages were left Tuesday with Donald McTigue, a Columbus attorney who submitted the petition language for “An Amendment to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol.” Backers can resubmit revised petition language after gathering another 1,000 signatures. The deadline for getting a constitutional amendment on the November ballot is July 1. The amendment seeks to allow anyone 21 or older to buy, possess and consume limited amounts of marijuana and to grow up to six plants. The Legislature approved the sale of medical marijuana in 2016. The state’s first dispensaries opened in January 2019. Recreational marijuana for adults is legal in 11 states.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt’s administration cannot divert gambling revenue from tribal casinos into a trust while a legal dispute between the governor and the tribes is pending in federal court, Oklahoma’s attorney general said in a legal opinion on Monday. In response to an inquiry from Sen. Roger Thompson, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Attorney General Mike Hunter said gambling revenue received by the state must be allocated under the provisions of state law, which directs that 12% of the revenue be deposited into the state’s general fund and the rest into a fund for public education. Stitt and several of the 39 federally recognized tribes in Oklahoma are locked in a dispute over revenue from tribal gambling. Stitt contends the compacts expired on Jan. 1, while the tribes maintain the compacts automatically renewed for another 15-year term. Several of the largest tribes sued the governor in federal court in December, and a federal judge has ordered mediation. In response to that lawsuit, Stitt suggested gambling revenue be placed in a trust until the lawsuit is settled. Meanwhile, gambling at tribal casinos has continued and tribes continue to remit payments to the state. Those payments last year totaled about $150 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced eight new agreements with parties responsible for cleaning up the Portland Harbor Superfund Site on the Willamette River. The agency said it has now signed cleanup agreements covering more than half of the Superfund site area, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Tuesday. Under the EPA’s cleanup plan, much of the Superfund site will be allowed to recover naturally over time without any active cleanup work. The agency is now negotiating with individual parties that are responsible for the pollution under a $1 billion plan. The site that runs from downtown Portland north to the Columbia Slough is highly contaminated from more than 100 years of industrial use. The agency is still negotiating with other parties that have yet to sign agreements. Federal regulators could issue enforcement orders to require cleanup action. The EPA already had agreements with the Port of Portland, the city of Portland and NW Natural. The agency is still negotiating with parties responsible for large portions of the Superfund site on the east side of the river near the University of Portland, the Overlook and St. Johns neighborhoods and along the northern portion of the Port of Portland. EPA officials said they could not disclose which parties have yet to sign agreements because negotiations are ongoing. For areas where “good faith negotiations” are not underway, they said, the agency plans to issue enforcement orders to require those parties to develop remedial design plans for the areas they are responsible for cleaning up.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: About $5.5 million that poured in from donors after the 2018 synagogue attack that killed 11 worshippers is being distributed according to a plan outlined Monday by Jewish groups. The largest share, just over $3 million, will go to the families of those killed and to two people who were seriously injured. Donations are also being distributed to people who were in the Tree of Life building during the attack, in honor of first responders and to the congregations. The payouts are based on recommendations by an independent, volunteer committee created by the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh. The group’s report issued in February said donors probably expected their gifts to help Tree of Life, which owns the building, as well as the two tenant congregations, Dor Hadash and New Light. Nearly $1.3 million will help Tree of Life rebuild the severely damaged synagogue building. Other payments will fund memorials related to the massacre, and the committee recommended the three congregations work together with victims and families on that effort.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A bill proposed in the state House last month plans to bring a resolution to the issue surrounding where private rights end and public access begins on the Rhode Island coasts, the Providence Journal reported. The proposal would make it so that people wouldn’t be arrested or charged if they were trying to exercise their constitutional privileges within 10 feet of the most recent high tide line on the sandy or rocky shore. “We’re not shrinking anyone’s property,” said state Rep. Blake Filippi. “We’re just saying the state is not going to come in and criminally enforce things on that property. I think it’s a smart way of preserving our constitutional rights while respecting private property.” Supporters of proposed legislation argued it would bring clarity to the long-standing issue of access to the state’s shores while avoiding costly lawsuits if they tried to take the property or declare it public. Currently, state law marks the public-access boundary through an average measurement of high water heights taken over a nearly two-decade cycle. Residents who are knowingly standing on the landward side of the so-called high tide line could be arrested for trespassing\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer who called himself “a reformed racist” after turning away from his segregationist past and toward civil rights died on Friday, his wife said. Tom Turnipseed, 83, died peacefully and without pain, his wife, Judy, said. She did not give a cause of death. Turnipseed was a frequent Democratic candidate for statewide office, losing races in 1974 for state attorney general, 1978 for governor, 1980 for U.S. House, lieutenant governor in 1982. and attorney general again in 1998. Turnipseed campaigned by playing off his last name, handing out packets of turnip seeds and promising to plant the seeds of good government if elected. Turnipseed first came to prominence in 1968 running the segregationist presidential campaign for former Alabama Gov. George Wallace. Turnipseed also was director of an organization in the 1960s that helped get accreditation for private schools founded after blacks were allowed to integrate schools. But Turnipseed said Wallace’s campaign made him feel uneasy and by 1971 he founded his law firm in Columbia and started working with African Americans on civil rights issues. He would introduce himself as “a reformed racist” the rest of his life. Turnipseed took on other causes like voting fairness, protecting the rights of the poor and fighting toxic waste being dumped in low income communities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Although Sioux Falls got a fraction of snow during February, there’s still an elevated risk of flooding. City, county and National Weather Service officials are preparing for almost guaranteed levels of flooding throughout the region. “Extreme wetness” caused by heavy precipitation in recent years has set the region on the brink of overflowing, said Mike Gillispie, senior service hydrologist for NWS in Sioux Falls. “Even though we don’t have a lot of snow left, we’re just getting into spring where we’re looking for heavier snow or rains,” Gillispie said. “We just don’t have the room to store that moisture that we would normally have had two or three years ago.” Although southeastern South Dakota has experienced some of the most ideal conditions to slow flooding threats, one major precipitation event could wash that away. Several factors have already set up Sioux Falls and surrounding areas for guaranteed minor flooding this spring, the Argus Leader reported. Moderate flooding in Brookings, Dell Rapids and Sioux Falls are all but guaranteed, Gillispie said. The catch is that the severity of flooding will be driven by rain and snow the area receives over the next two months – and how much of it falls at one time. As of late February, Sioux Falls has a 50% chance of hitting the flood levels of March 2019, which tore through Dell Rapids, Renner and Sioux Falls. Several homes had to be evacuated in a southern Sioux Falls neighborhood near Tomar Park. Typically, the chance of reaching that stage of flooding for this time of year would be 15%, Gillispie said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:All 56 of Tennessee’s state parks will offer free spring hikes guided by a ranger on March 21, officials said Monday. Hikes of all difficulties will be available. Hikers are urged to have sturdy footwear and bring water, snacks and even hiking sticks. State parks also offer free hikes on National Trails Day, National Public Lands Day, after Thanksgiving Day and to mark the new year. More than 3,600 people took part in First Day Hikes on Jan. 1, officials said. Participants can find a hike on the Tennessee State Parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi:The U.S. Department of Transportation said the Port of Corpus Christi will get nearly $18 million in federal funds to support its large-scale revamp of the Avery Point Terminal. The formal grant award was made Tuesday by U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine L. Chao at Port Houston, according to a news release issued by the Department of Transportation. The Port of Corpus Christi is one of two of ports in the state that will benefit from about $39 million in total allocated funds. In addition to the $17.6 million award to the Port of Corpus Christi, about $22 million will be set aside for Port Houston’s project to construct a wharf and install an accompanying crane rail, according to the news release. The money is drawn from about $280 million in port infrastructure development program grants, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A near-total abortion ban that was one of two abortion proposals advancing at the Legislature on Monday could mean criminal charges for women who end their own pregnancies. Republican sponsor Sen. Dan McCay said he understands concerns about unwanted pregnancies, but also believes an abortion is a “life that’s been lost in utero,” the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The proposal was ultimately approved by a panel of lawmakers and now moves to the House floor. The left-leaning group Alliance for a Better Utah called the bill “unbelievably cruel and extreme.” McCay’s bill has a trigger clause and would only go into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Abortion opponents across the country are hopeful the Supreme Court will reconsider the landmark ruling with new conservative justices. The Utah ban would have a few exceptions, including rape and serious risk to the health of the mother. Other abortions could bring charges punishable by up to 15 years in prison and a $10,000 fine, upon conviction. A separate requirement that abortion providers show a woman an ultrasound before the procedure was also approved in committee. Women could look away, but physicians could face fines starting at up to $100,000. That proposal now moves to the House floor. A third bill regulating the disposal of fetal remains has passed the Legislature and is now on Gov. Gary Herbert’s desk.\n\nVermont\n\nHighgate: Vermont’s maple syrup season got underway officially Monday when Republican Gov. Phil Scott tapped a tree at Gagne Maple in Highgate with help from children from the Highgate Elementary School. Vermont’s maple industry has led the nation in total syrup produced for decades. For the last three years, the maple industry has brought in more than $50 million in revenue each year. “Vermont maple is second to none, and we wouldn’t have the best in the world if it wasn’t for hard working families and sugar makers like the Gagnes,” Scott said in a statement issued by his office. “With Vermont’s leadership and example, maple continues to be a valuable agricultural product and an important part of Vermont’s economy and brand.” Statistics showed that Vermont’s maple industry employs more than 4,000 people. The state produces nearly half of the maple syrup in the United States.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A 96-year-old war hero looked on as military officials commissioned a U.S. Navy warship in honor of the last surviving Medal of Honor recipient from the Battle of Iwo Jima. The USS Hershel “Woody” Williams was commissioned Saturday in Norfolk, , with the World War II veteran present. The USS Williams is an Expeditionary Sea Base ship that was built and launched in 2017. With its commissioning, the vessel’s designation changed from a support ship to a warship, and command transferred from the Military Sealift Command to Naval Surface Force Atlantic. Williams described the commissioning as “a moment in history that is beyond my comprehension.” “May all those who serve aboard this ship that bears my name be safe and proud. May she have God’s blessings for a long life of service to America, the greatest country on Earth,” he said. The ship will primarily support aviation mine countermeasure and special operations missions, freeing up amphibious warships and surface combatant ships for more demanding operational missions. Its four core capabilities are aviation facilities, berthing, equipment staging and command and control assets.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The Legislature has approved a measure that would make Washington the 20th state to not tax feminine hygiene products. The measure passed the House on a 95-2 vote and now heads to the governor. It was unanimously approved by the Senate on Saturday. Once signed by the governor, the new law takes effect July 1. Under the bill, products that are exempt from sales and use tax include sanitary napkins, tampons, menstrual cups, or any other similar menstrual product. The measure was part of the Senate supplemental budget plan, and its passage by both chambers comes as lawmakers are nearing an end of negotiations on a final budget before the Legislature adjourns on Thursday. Washington is among 31 states that still tax menstrual products, according to Period Equity, a nonprofit group that is campaigning to end “tampon taxes” in states.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Several West Virginia slopes are set to offer free lift tickets to skiers and snowboarders as the season comes to a close, according to the state Ski Areas Association. Lift tickets will be free for West Virginia residents on March 15 at Canaan Valley Resort in Tucker County and Winterplace resort in Raleigh County, the association said. Snowshoe Mountain in Pocahontas County will offer the same deal the following weekend on March 22. Guests must show proof of residence to claim their free pass, according to the guidelines. Canaan Valley Resort plans to close for the season following the free day, and Snowshoe Mountain said it will end its season March 29, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. Winterplace has said it will evaluate snow conditions and schedule a closing date soon.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Farmers are adjusting to growing crops in wet and cold conditions after last year’s weather challenges, crop specialists said. The weather last spring delayed crop growth and harvesting, Wisconsin Public Radio reported. It also led to a record number of unused acres by federal crop insurance deadlines. Kevin Jarek, the agricultural agent for University of Wisconsin-Extension in Outagamie County, said some farmers are worried about another late planting season this year because the National Weather Service has reported precipitation numbers that are above average. Many farmers are relying on seed varieties with a shorter growing season to prepare for the upcoming growing season, Jarek said. Farmers are also preparing for potential crop diseases.Damon Smith, field crops plant pathologist at UW-Madison, said that new disease trends have developed over the last couple of years. “We’re just treading water in the growing season, and so we’re seeing some shifts in terms of how folks are going to manage the crop,” Smith said. “We’ve had three consistent years of white mold in soybeans, and so we’re seeing people entertaining (the idea of) adjusting planting populations and row with spacing and actually making agronomic decisions now to try to reduce the potential for that disease.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Information on missing or murdered indigenous people in Wyoming could improve under legislation that would better manage missing persons reports and potentially coordinate work between multiple jurisdictions. Law enforcement agencies will be required to report missing persons and include their biographical information under a bill signed by Gov. Mark Gordon on Monday, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. The state will then compile an annual report on the number of missing people in Wyoming. The state would also help its two tribes implement their own Amber Alert system, require state officials to provide training on crimes involving missing and murdered indigenous people and mandate cooperation between law enforcement agencies. Another bill that would coordinate reporting and investigative efforts between jurisdictions operating in and around tribal land wasd scheduled to be signed Tuesday. Both proposals cleared the state Legislature last week and have received support from tribal leaders.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/02/railgun-derailed-giuliani-endorses-west-nile-virus-news-around-states/117344304/", "title": "Railgun derailed, Giuliani endorses, West Nile virus: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Because of a chance for storms Friday, the city announced that the free Stars and Stripes Forever celebration has been moved from the amphitheater to the Union Station Train Shed, with music acts and dance presentations from 6-9 p.m. \"A lot of talent from the River Region on one stage Friday night,\" said country artist and radio host Jessie Lynn, a Prattville native known as Alabama's Singing Cowgirl. She will co-host the night with celebrity DJ and entertainer Rick Joyner. Lynn said there will be 17 music pieces in the show's first half, all of which are tributes to America. Midway through, Lynn said they will have four singalongs for the audience to participate. Stars and Stripes Forever also features dance performances by Alabama State University's BFA Dance Program and the Montgomery Ballet. Performances will close out with a set from the 10-piece group MGM Soul Collective.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Montana man was reunited with his 14-week-old border collie two days after the dog disappeared following a bear attack on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula. Jason Umbriaco was hospitalized after the brown bear with two cubs bit him twice Sunday, Alaska’s News Source reported. “It was just a shock. I couldn’t believe it,” Umbriaco said after being reunited with Buckley. “I had kind of given up hope, and I was sort of making preparations inside to just move forward without him, and now it’s like I’m gonna have those times back of just joy, and peace.” The attack happened in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, about 60 miles south of Anchorage, while he and Buckley were hiking. Umbriaco said the bear moved on him so fast, he didn’t have time to pull out his bear spray. He said the bear covered about 50 feet “in an instant. So then I held my arms up in sort of a defensive position and then she bit me on the forearm kind of up close to my elbow.” When the bear let go, he panicked and jumped into the adjacent Kenai River. “In almost any other circumstance and in probably this circumstance, it was a terrible option, but that was the one I had,” he said. “And then she reaches down and then bites me on the shoulder.” The bear retreated after the second bite and was last seen walking up a hill with her cubs.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The Air Force wants to free up space for more fighter aircraft at Nellis Air Force Base in metro Las Vegas by transferring attack and rescue aircraft to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson. Under realignment plans announced Wednesday with an Air Force budget request, units operating A-10 Thunderbolt II attack jets and HH-60 Pave Hawk rescue helicopters would be transferred to Davis-Monthan. The transfers from Nellis are intended to allow the Air Force to assign F-35A Lightning II and F-22 Raptor fighters to the Nevada base for testing and training while locating more rescue units together at Davis-Monthan, according to Air Force statements. The first phase of the proposed plan is contingent on congressional approval of retirement of 42 A-10s, including 35 at Davis-Monthan, an Air Force statement said. The Air Force said it will conduct a required environmental analysis before the moves are made and that it plans to modernize 218 of its current fleet of 281 combat-capable A-10s. The Air Force in 2019 awarded a contract for the purchase of new wings for 218 A-10s. With avionic modernizations, the aircraft will be ably to fly well into the 2030s, the Air Force said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The sponsor of Arkansas’ voter ID law said he will challenge the incumbent secretary of state in next year’s Republican primary. State Rep. Mark Lowery announced he would oppose Secretary of State John Thurston for the Republican nomination. Thurston was first elected in 2018 and is seeking a new term. Lowery sponsored a 2017 law that reinstated the state’s requirement that voters show photo identification before being allowed to cast a ballot. A previous voter ID law had been struck down by the state Supreme Court, but justices in 2018 upheld Lowery’s revision. Lowery also sponsored a measure enacted this year that removed the ability of people without identification to cast a ballot if they sign an affidavit affirming their identity. Lowery has served in the state House since 2013.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAvalon: A 15-year-old boy was bitten on the hand by a shark Wednesday morning while kayaking off Santa Catalina Island, authorities said. The boy, who was taking part in a Boy Scouts camp, was with his father when their kayak was bumped by what was believed to be a shark of unknown type or size, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said in a statement. “During the encounter, the boy had put his hand in the water” and was bitten, lifeguard spokesman Pono Barnes with the Fire Department said. The Boy Scouts of America said the boy was near the Emerald Bay Camp when he received a bite that was not life-threatening. A camp doctor and paramedic treated the boy and he was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition to have surgery, authorities said. It was the first shark-related injury in the nearly 100-year history of its Emerald Bay Camp, the Boy Scouts said. The Boy Scouts said a morning boat check of the waters before the incident hadn’t turned up any hazards. Water activities at the camp have now been cancelled, the organization said. Lifeguards also cleared and closed down a stretch of ocean for 24 hours.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver:Students in American Indian tribes with historical ties to Colorado will receive in-state tuition at public Colorado universities starting this fall. Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill Monday requiring universities to provide in-state tuition in recognition that many American Indian tribes were forced to leave Colorado and that students who belong to tribes that left weren’t getting in-state tuition at the place their tribe considered home. At one point, there were at least 48 tribes in Colorado, 46 of which are no longer in the state. The law reads that because students in these tribes might have been forced to move away from Colorado, or their “historic home place,” and because American Indians have low rates of students attending college and high rates of poverty, Colorado should provide them in-state tuition. In 2021, Colorado State University had just 141 students – less than 1% of its undergraduate population – who identified as American Indian or Alaska Native. American Indian students made up just 1.5% of the undergraduate population at the University of Colorado Boulder, whose board of regents supported the bill through the legislature.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington:The Stonington Historical Society will hold its annual Independence Day parade beginning at 11:30 a.m. Sunday, beginning at the southwest corner of Wadawanuck Square. The public is encouraged to join the informal parade as it processes to Cannon Square and then back to Wadawanuck Square. Ann-Marie Houle, a local teacher and Stonington native, and Tom McCoy, a former Borough crossing guard, will serve as the Grand Marshalls of the parade. After the parade, the Declaration of Independence will be read aloud. As is a local tradition, attendees will then cast a pox on King George after the reading.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach:The Grove Park Canal Dock is finished and open to the public as a new route to reach Rehoboth Beach. Although the canal has always been an essential part of the city, the completion of this new dock allows people access to the waterway that before wasn’t possible. The new dock includes a pathway that takes visitors to the water with fresh landscaping and native plants on either side. People can ride up to the dock in private boats to briefly tie up for loading and unloading of passengers or materials, according to city spokesperson Lynne Coan. Anyone with a kayak can also launch from this dock. “It’s not meant to really double as a marina or a long-term tie up,” said Scott Thomas, executive director of Southern Delaware Tourism. “It’s a transient dock.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:New Balance is taking advantage of the recent focus on D.C. statehood by releasing a shoe that embodies pride in the city, WUSA-TV reported. Designed by June Sanders, who was born in the District and raised in Prince George's County, the shoe uses the D.C. flag as its focal point, and is intended to help people \"discover and celebrate\" D.C. The 992DC is for sale on the DTLR website for about $200 and at store locations across D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: An exit off Interstate 95 had to be closed for 3 hours after 100 homing pigeons fell off a truck and refused to move, posing a driving hazard to motorists, officials said. A crate carrying 100 homing pigeons fell off the truck late Tuesday near Daytona Beach. Because the birds roost at night, the pigeons stayed on the road until bright lights from vehicles startled them. They flew into the air and created a hazard for drivers, according to a news release from Volusia County officials. “It’s the worst case scenario – homing pigeons that can’t find their home,” the news release said. Sheriff’s deputies, state troopers and animal service workers attempted to capture the pigeons, ultimately recovering 73 fowl. The birds weren’t banded so their owner wasn’t immediately determined, officials said. “Our job is to help animals find their way home, whether they’re covered in fur, scales, or in this case feathers,” said Volusia County Animal Control Officer Alicia Dease. “We’re hoping someone out there might have information on where these birds came from or the truck that was carrying them.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is endorsing a Democrat-turned-Republican who’s challenging Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the state’s 2022 Republican primary. Giuliani spoke to reporters Wednesday before headlining a fundraising dinner for former state Rep. Vernon Jones in Atlanta. Jones was on the outs with his party when he shot to prominence in Republican circles as an African American Democrat who endorsed Donald Trump’s reelection campaign. Jones has since switched parties and doubled down in support of Trump’s claims of election fraud, appealing to Republican voters in Georgia who might be unhappy with Kemp. Trump has repeatedly attacked Kemp but has not endorsed Jones. Giuliani said his main reason for endorsing Jones was their shared belief that Trump was cheated out of Georgia’s 16 electoral votes and the overall election. “The current governor has been a failure. I mean, he’s had his time. He put together an election that wouldn’t have passed muster in Africa, Asia, in undeveloped countries,” Giuliani said.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: The state has asked the public to comment on a proposal to install mooring buoys to address overcrowding at two popular manta ray viewing sites off the Kona Coast. The Department of Land and Natural Resources said it plans to install 13 of the buoys at Kaukalaelae Point, off Keauhou, and 12 at Makako Bay, off Keahole Point. The plan would remove and reconfigure existing moorings at the sites, which weren’t permitted and haven’t been managed or maintained by the state, West Hawaii Today reported. The moorings would protect natural resources by eliminating the use of chains and anchors that can damage coral reefs, the department said. More manta ray viewing tour boats could also use the sites if the buoys were installed. A 2015 study by Marine Science Consulting LLC found that the manta tours host up to 300 divers and snorkelers nightly with an estimated 60 operators competing for space and access at the two sites.\n\nIdaho\n\nSandpoint: Wildlife officials said a backcountry camper killed a moose in self defense after the animal charged him and his dog. The Department of Fish and Game said in a prepared statement that the incident happened last week when the camper was at Harrison Lake, north of Sandpoint. The moose tore apart the man’s campsite and charged the camper and his dog. The camper hid behind a tree, according to the department, but the moose didn’t stop charging. That’s when the camper shot the animal at close range, killing it. Officials with the Fish and Game Department responded to the shooting, and the U.S. Forest Service has since closed the Harrison Lake trailhead to hikers so they don’t encounter any bears that might feed on the carcass. Moose in Idaho can weigh as much as 1,100 pounds, with bulls standing nearly 6 feet high at the shoulder. State wildlife officials said hikers should make noise to avoid surprising moose or other potentially dangerous wildlife, and that if a moose puts its ears back or raises the hair on its neck, it might be about to charge. The Department of Fish and Game said people should carry bear spray when hiking or camping because it can be used to deter many animals in unsafe encounters.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: After 40 days without solid food, Rachelle Zola ended her hunger strike for slavery reparations Saturday with a few small bites of yogurt. Zola, 73, of Chicago said she lost 23 pounds and felt weak during her last two days of drinking only water, Pedialyte and bone broth. But she pronounced the experience an unqualified success, citing dozens of productive conversations with ordinary people, as well as TV, radio and print newspaper coverage of her fast for H.R. 40, a U.S. House bill that would establish a federal commission to hold hearings on slavery and discrimination and recommend remedies. “My voice is only getting stronger,” Zola said Monday. Zola, who is white, came to Chicago from Tucson, Arizona, in 2019 to meet Black and brown people and hear their stories, and embarked on the fast as a result of multiple conversations, meetings and workshops. She hoped to attract the attention of other white people, and spur the adoption of H.R. 40, a version of a reparations bill that was first introduced in Congress more than 30 years ago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana’s COVID-19 precautions further eased Thursday under new executive orders issued by Gov. Eric Holcomb, even as he cited worries about the state’s lagging vaccination rate. The state’s public health emergency was extended until at least the end of July as Holcomb on Wednesday signed the 16th renewal of that order that he first issued in March 2020. Holcomb’s order said its renewal ensures Indiana can continue responding effectively to the pandemic. It also keeps the state eligible for additional Medicaid funding and other federal assistance programs. The governor pointed out that Indiana’s fully vaccinated rate of 48% ranks the state 38th in the country – and that 98.5% of new COVID-19 infections are among unvaccinated people. The coronavirus “remains a threat to the health, safety and welfare of all residents of Indiana,” the order said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A federal judge in Iowa admitted wrongdoing and publicly apologized for comments ridiculing former President Donald Trump for issuing a series of pardons to well-connected Republican officials. Senior U.S. District Judge Robert Pratt made the remarks during a phone interview with the Associated Press in December, saying: \"It's not surprising a criminal like Trump pardons other criminals.\" In a bit of humor, he added, \"But apparently to get a pardon, one has to be either a Republican, a convicted child murderer or a turkey.\" Pratt's remarks set off a firestorm of criticism among lawyers, who said that they were inappropriate from a federal judge. They also triggered a judicial misconduct complaint against Pratt by Lavenski Smith, chief judge of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, where Pratt has long worked at the Des Moines courthouse, this week posted online a letter dated April 16 from Pratt to Smith. Pratt said he accepted Smith's conclusion that his comments constitute \"cognizable misconduct\" because they veered into what could be construed as \"inappropriate partisan statements.\" The court said it was posting the letter at Smith's direction. Pratt has been on the bench since his appointment by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1997. He has had a reduced caseload since 2012, when he assumed senior status.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Kansas’ largest school district won’t require students and teacher to wear face masks or get a COVID-19 vaccination during the upcoming school year. The Wichita Eagle reported that the Board of Education for Wichita Public Schools reviewed the district’s reopening plan, but took no formal action. The board previously delegated COVID-19 operational decisions to the superintendent. The mask requirement in district facilities will end Tuesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky State Fair, which takes place Aug. 19-29, will offer special deals on admission as it reopens to the public, officials said. Early bird tickets are available beginning Friday for $8 per person, which includes parking, fair officials said in a statement. The price is good through Aug. 5. Admission at the gate is $10 per person, plus parking. “After a year without having a public Fair, we thought it was important to focus on accessibility so we could bring as many Kentuckians together to experience the concerts, the food and the fun unique to our annual festival,” said David S. Beck, president and CEO of Kentucky Venues. The annual event in Louisville featuring shows, exhibits and other entertainment was closed to the public last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some events were held but only participants were allowed to attend.\n\nLouisiana\n\nMorehouse Parish: A bear that gained a social media following while wandering hundreds of miles in the Midwest before reaching Louisiana has died after being hit by a vehicle, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries said Wednesday. The male bear dubbed Bruno was euthanized Tuesday because there was no way he could have survived, said Maria Davidson, large carnivore program manager for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Not only were both back legs broken, but they were paralyzed because of spinal injuries, she said: “He had been dragging himself, literally.” Biologists estimated that Bruno had been injured about a month before a homeowner in Morehouse Parish, which is on the Arkansas state line in northeastern Louisiana, called the department Tuesday, saying a bear wouldn’t leave the yard. Biologists went there. “He was in bad shape. It was rough,” Davidson said.\n\nMaine\n\nBath: The U.S. Navy pulled the plug, for now, on a futuristic weapon that fires projectiles at up to seven times the speed of sound using electricity. The Navy spent more than a decade developing the electromagnetic railgun and once considered putting them on the stealthy new Zumwalt-class destroyers built at Maine’s Bath Iron Works. But the Defense Department is turning its attention to hypersonic missiles to keep up with China and Russia, and the Navy cut funding for railgun research from its latest budget proposal. “The railgun is, for the moment, dead,” said Matthew Caris, a defense analyst at Avascent Group, a consulting firm. The Navy’s decision to pause research at year’s end frees up resources for hypersonic missiles, directed-energy systems like lasers and electronic warfare systems, said Lt. Courtney Callaghan, a Navy spokesperson.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Federal and state authorities are offering more than $20,000 in rewards in the fatal shooting of the Texas mother of a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman candidate as she sat outside a Maryland hotel. Michelle Cummings, 57, of Houston was killed early Tuesday outside the Graduate Hotel in Annapolis, where she was dropping her son off at the academy, city police said. Cummings was the mother of Midshipman Candidate Leonard Cummings III, a plebe, or incoming freshman, and football prospect, according to the Naval Academy. Induction for the incoming class began Tuesday, kicking off basic midshipman training called Plebe Summer. Investigators believe that Cummings was struck by a stray bullet while she was on the hotel’s patio, said Annapolis Police Chief Edward Jackson. Two people were sitting in an SUV on a nearby street when shots rang out and Cummings was struck at least once, Jackson said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAmesbury: A mixed-media painting attributed to Pablo Picasso has been sold after spending 50 years in a closet in a house in Maine. John McInnis Auctioneers, based in Massachusetts, confirmed that the painting entitled “Le Tricorne” sold on Saturday, the Boston Globe reported. The 16-by-16-inch painting is signed and dated in the year 1919. It is believed to be a study for the stage curtain Picasso painted for a ballet of the same name that debuted that year in London, according to the New York Historical Society. That curtain has been on display at the historical society in New York City since 2015. The website liveauctioneers.com reported the sale price of the painting was $150,000, plus a 24% buyer’s premium. Neither the buyer nor the seller was named, but the seller gave a statement on the website saying the painting was found in a closet of a home his father inherited from a female relative who studied art in Europe in the 1920s. The buyer will have at least 120 days to authenticate the painting with The Claude Picasso Administration, which is managed by the artist’s son.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: About $5 million in cash and college scholarships will be given away in lottery-style drawings aimed at raising Michigan’s COVID-19 vaccination rate, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Thursday. The incentive program features a $2 million jackpot, a $1 million prize and 30 daily drawings of $50,000 for residents ages 18 and older who have gotten at least one shot. Vaccinated residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for one of nine four-year prepaid tuition contracts valued at $55,000. The MI Shot to Win Sweepstakes is being launched after several states, including Ohio, offered millions of dollars to boost vaccinations – with mixed results. Nearly 62% of Michigan residents ages 16 and older have received at least one dose, ranking it near the middle among states, as infections have plummeted. Whitmer and state health officials want 70% vaccinated, which would require about 678,000 additional people to get a shot.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnetonka: A juvenile has died in a collision involving two Jet Skis on Lake Minnetonka’s Upper East Lake, according to Hennepin County sheriff’s officials. The sheriff’s water patrol responded to a call shortly before 6 p.m. Wednesday and found one person unresponsive. According to authorities, boaters on the lake had pulled the young person from the water and started CPR before the water patrol arrived. The victim was taken to the patrol’s headquarters in Spring Park where an ambulance was waiting. Officials said the person operating the other Jet Ski was not seriously injured. The juvenile who died has not yet been identified.\n\nMississippi\n\nOcean Springs: A centuries-old live oak tree that survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005 faces removal because arborists said it could fall onto a playground that sits in its shade. The oak in Fort Maurepas Park in the city of Ocean Springs took another pounding from Hurricane Zeta last year. It now leans west, with limbs extending over the playground. The Ocean Springs Board of Alderman voted June 15 to take the tree down after an arborist who inspected it in November said the root system is failing, the Sun Herald reported. Residents invited another arborist to inspect the tree Monday, the newspaper reported. Several residents, Alderman Rickey Authement and Mayor-Elect Kenny Holloway attended. But the second arborist’s conclusion largely matched the original arborist’s. He recommended removing the tree, estimated to be at least 200 years old, because of liability involving the playground.\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: Health officials working to boost lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates in Missouri are growing anxious as the Fourth of July weekend approaches, creating ripe conditions for the fast-spreading delta variant to send hospital numbers climbing. “We are just kind of keeping an eye to see what is going to happen,” Lisa Marshall, the health director for Taney County, which includes the tourist town of Branson. “We’ve seen that these numbers can jump pretty quickly.”Missouri is second only to Nevada for having the worst diagnosis rate over the past week. And its seven-day rolling average of daily new cases has risen over the past two weeks from 576.14 new cases per day on June 15 to 891.71 new cases per day on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. State data showed hospitalizations are up sharply, increasing by 38% from 637 on the last day of May to 882 on Wednesday. And the situation is even worse in southwest Missouri, where hospitalizations jumped from 134 to 317 over the same period.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte declared a statewide drought emergency Thursday as more than 92% of Montana faces abnormally dry conditions. “Every region of the state faces severe to extreme drought conditions, and the situation is getting worse. These alarming drought conditions are devastating our ag producers, challenging our tourism industry, and could bring a severe wildfire season,” Gianforte said in a statement. The declaration directs the state departments of agriculture, livestock, natural resources and conservation to work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to secure federal funding to address the fallout from the drought. The order also suspends some regulations for motor vehicles providing drought-related support. A report released by the state Wednesday predicted drought conditions will worsen in the next two months. Drought metrics are significantly worse than they were the same time last year, when just under half of the state confronted similar dryness. Nearly 20% of the state is in extreme drought, up from 14% a week ago, according to figures released Thursday.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nebraska plans to stop reporting coronavirus numbers online after Wednesday. The state Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that it plans to retire the online dashboard that it has used to report statistics on the coronavirus pandemic for more than a year. The current state virus emergency was also set to expire on Wednesday, and along with that, Nebraska is eliminating the last few social distancing guidelines that remained in place. State officials said data on the pandemic will still be available through public records requests, and they said statistics on the spread of the coronavirus are available from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of its final update Wednesday, the state had reported 224,488 virus cases and 2,261 deaths linked to COVID-19 since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Nevada’s minimum wage increased by 75 cents on Thursday to $8.75 an hour for employees who get health benefits and $9.75 an hour for those who do not. The state’s Democratic-controlled Legislature in 2019 passed a law gradually increasing to the state’s minimum wage to $11 for those with health benefits and $12 for those without by 2024. The first increase was last year.The increase will also raise daily overtime rates starting July 1, except for workers exempt from overtime rules. Democrats, including President Joe Biden, have been pushing to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The federal minimum is $7.25 and has not been raised since 2009.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlainfield: A house that was the setting for a monthslong armed standoff in 2007 between a couple and U.S. marshals over tax evasion is back on the market. The 7,500-square-foot former home of Ed and Elaine Brown in Plainfield is listed for $1.59 million, the Valley News reported. The current owners bought the home in 2019 for $315,000 and put in new windows, a redesigned kitchen, hardwood floors, four fireplaces and a steam room, among the upgrades. “Some of the first steps that they took was essentially bringing it back up to livable conditions,” said Lochrane Gary, a real estate agent listing the home. “They did everything from the ground up.” The Browns were convicted of failing to pay taxes on $1.9 million of income. They declined to appear in court and retreated to the fortress-like home. U.S. marshals arrived; a standoff went on for nearly eight months as anti-tax crusaders and militia groups rallied to the Browns’ cause. The marshals eventually arrested the Browns. Elaine Brown apologized for her actions and was released last year after serving more than 12 years in prison. Ed Brown is expected to serve another 16 years.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: New Jersey’s yearlong coronavirus-inspired ban on smoking in Atlantic City casinos will end Sunday, just in time for the Fourth of July holiday. Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that an order he signed ending a public health emergency contained a “sunset” provision winding down the smoking ban within 30 days, which is Sunday. Although acknowledging gamblers will be free to light up again starting Sunday, the Democratic governor indicated he would look favorably on a measure lawmakers are considering to permanently end smoking in New Jersey’s casinos. “I would be very constructive on that,” he said at a coronavirus briefing, stopping short of saying he would sign the legislation. The governor’s remarks came two hours after dozens of casino workers and anti-smoking advocates rallied on the Atlantic City boardwalk to call for a permanent smoking ban. Casinos are exempted from a state law banning most indoor smoking, and an Atlantic City law limits smoking to no more than 25% of the casino floor.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico business owners are hopeful as Thursday marked the end of the state’s limits on occupancy rates and other restrictions that the governor had imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. And although the state also ended its color-coded risk system for counties, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and state health officials said the campaign to get more people vaccinated will continue. The Democratic governor had set a goal of getting 60% of residents fully vaccinated two weeks before the reopening. That mark was missed but she still opted to lift the restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activities as scheduled. The state now reports about 62% of eligible resident are vaccinated. With the restrictions lifted, all businesses across the state can operate at 100% capacity and all limitations on mass gatherings are gone. Businesses and local governments may still adopt and require additional precautions at their discretion, state officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Bruce Springsteen, Paul Simon and Jennifer Hudson will headline an August concert in Central Park, marking the city’s comeback from the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “It is going to be a great moment for the city, marking our rebirth, marking our comeback, and it’s going to be one of the greatest Central Park concerts in history,” the mayor said at a virtual news briefing. De Blasio announced last month that producer Clive Davis would recruit an all-star lineup for a Central Park concert in August. No exact date has been announced. More performers will be announced in the coming weeks, de Blasio said. The concert will come 30 years after Simon’s memorable Aug. 15, 1991 Central Park concert, which was recorded and released as a live album and concert film. Springsteen’s return to Broadway last weekend was itself a step in the city’s recovery from the pandemic. “He is beloved in New York City in an extraordinary way even though he happens to come from New Jersey – no one’s perfect,” de Blasio said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A venomous snake has been captured two days after it was spotted on the loose in a neighborhood of North Carolina’s capital. The Raleigh Police Department sent out a notice late Wednesday announcing that the zebra cobra was found and safely removed from a northwest Raleigh neighborhood. Police didn’t give more details about how or where it was caught. An animal control officer was called Monday to a home where a snake was spotted on a porch, police said. But by the time the officer arrived, the snake had slithered away. Then they learned that a zebra cobra was missing from a home in the area. Officials warned anyone who saw the snake to stay away and call 911, saying it could spit and bite if cornered. WNCN-TV reports that animal control and Raleigh police used wooden boards with special glue on them to trap the snake. It was then moved from the board into a red bucket. Venomous snakes are legal to own in North Carolina, but they must be kept in an escape-proof, bite-proof enclosures and owners must notify law enforcement if one escapes.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: An environmental group wary about the sale of North Dakota’s largest coal-fired power plant by a nonprofit Minnesota electric cooperative wants officials in that state to review the deal, saying ratepayers are being left in the dark. Bismarck-based Rainbow Energy Center LLC said it reached an agreement Wednesday to acquire the Coal Creek Station in west-central North Dakota from Maple Grove, Minnesota-based Great River Energy. The acquisition also includes the purchase of associated transmission lines that run from central North Dakota to Minnesota by an affiliate of Rainbow Energy. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. “This smells like a backroom deal that benefits the North Dakota coal lobby, not regular Minnesotans,” Margaret Levin, director of the Minnesota chapter of the Sierra Club, said in a statement. “It also sounds like Minnesota customers may remain on the hook for paying for power from this economic loser of a plant for years to come.” Rainbow Energy said the deal still requires state approval of permit transfers and the green light by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates utilities, power generators and pipelines. The Sierra Club, a San Francisco-based group that wants to curb the use of fossil fuels, wants to extend the review to the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the state attorney general.\n\nOhio\n\nSandusky: A longtime school resource officer who used a stun gun on two high school students during a self-defense training class has been fired. Perkins Township trustees voted 3-0 on Monday to dismiss Tonya Corbin, who was a resource officer at Perkins High School. She had been on unpaid leave since June 15. Corbin was teaching a self-defense class for female students at the school on May 19 when she brought a stun gun to the class and used it on two students, ages 17 and 18, authorities said. Corbin initially denied using the stun gun, saying she had allowed the students to use it themselves. The two students and a teacher at the school disputed that claim, and Corbin admitted to deploying the stun gun, authorities said. The self-defense class had been provided to students in the past, but this was the first time Corbin was leading it, officials have said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A voter-approved expansion of Medicaid took effect Thursday in Oklahoma after a decade of Republican resistance in a state that has become emblematic of the political struggle to extend the federal health insurance program in conservative strongholds. Oklahoma moved ahead with its expansion at a time when Democrats in Washington and across the states are pressing to complete the work of the Obama-era Affordable Care Act, recently upheld by the Supreme Court for the third time in a decade. So far, 38 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, and expansion in a dozen mostly Southern states might be the biggest piece of unfinished business. More than 123,000 low-income people already have been approved for Medicaid coverage in Oklahoma, a state where nearly 15% of the population has been uninsured – the highest rate in the nation behind Texas, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. State Medicaid officials said they expect that number to increase to more than 200,000 as more people get approved.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Firefighters on Wednesday tried to contain a wildfire that burned 10,000 acres near the farming community of Dufur, Oregon. Gov. Kate Brown invoked the Emergency Conflagration Act in response to the fire, allowing the state fire marshal to mobilize firefighters and equipment to help local firefighters. Some 40 personnel, 12 fire engines engines and other resources were on the scene, authorities said. The fire was burning in wheat and brush in the sparsely populated area of north-central Oregon. Firefighters from the Portland area were among those assisting the effort to extinguish the blaze, which ignited Tuesday. The FBI, meanwhile, on Wednesday offered a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest, and conviction of those responsible for setting a fire on the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs Reservation on June 21. The fire burned approximately 42 acres of brush and grass alongside Highway 3 near the reservation fish hatchery in central Oregon. Warm Springs emergency crews battled the blaze. The FBI and the Warm Springs Police Department want anyone with information about the fire to contact them.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican-crafted bill to ban COVID-19 “vaccine passports” in some cases and to restrict the health secretary’s actions during health emergencies was vetoed Thursday by Gov. Tom Wolf. The measure split both legislative chambers along party lines last month, and Wolf had said he would veto the proposal. With millions of Pennsylvanians still unvaccinated, many seemingly intent on remaining so, legislative Republicans wanted to prevent what they viewed as stigmatizing policies that require proof of vaccination in violation of health privacy. The bill would have kept colleges and universities that receive state money from mandating proof of COVID-19 vaccination to enter buildings, attend class in person or undertake any activity. State and local governmental entities would have been similarly restricted, and governments would not have been allowed to include coronavirus vaccine status on ID cards. It also would have kept the health secretary from ordering closures or directing people who have not been exposed to a contagion to physically distance, wear a mask, quarantine or restrict their travel. The Wolf administration believes the bill, if passed, would have applied to all cases, not just during the current pandemic.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Greenwich:Capt. Regan Keenan was among six Rhode Island National Guard members who were given awards Wednesday for their roles in the Guard's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Rhode Island. The Guard has played an important role in the state's fight against COVID-19. It has run test sites, administered vaccinations and set up field hospitals during the pandemic. At the peak, the Guard had just under 1,000 members activated for COVID-19 response, according to Capt. Mark A. Inzce, a Guard spokesman. The Guard has administered more than 360,000 doses, representing more than 180,000 complete vaccinations, Inzce said. The other recipients were Col. David Ashley, Maj. Joanne Barrett and Staff Sgt. Nicole Mackay of the Air Guard, and Lt. Col. Matthew Edwards and Staff Sgt. Jessica Godena of the Army Guard.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: For the first time in 23 years, it won’t cost drivers anything to take the quickest way to the heart of Hilton Head Island. Tolls on the Cross Island Parkway were dropped Thursday after South Carolina made its final bond payment on the $81 million road that opened in 1998. The toll booths will remain up until the Department of Transportation can start a $14 million project to remove them and make other improvements in the coming months. For now, signs are in place reminding drivers to slow in the area. The 7-mile expressway veers off from the only road to the island just after it crosses the Intracoastal Waterway, allowing drivers to avoid a 12-mile route full of stoplights and suburban sprawl. The toll was $1.25 for a passenger car before it was dropped. The state now has only one toll road – the Southern Connector which connects Interstate 385 to Interstate 85 south of Greenville. That freeway is about 30 years from having its bonds paid off and dropping the tolls.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge who charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court over a COVID-19 vaccination dispute removed himself from the case after assigning an in-state attorney to prosecute the proceedings. The chain of events began when state and federal prosecutors declined to handle the case. A retired attorney whom U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann tried to appoint opted out over debate on whether he needed to restart his practice. Kormann than assigned Thomas Fritz, of Rapid City, and recused himself. Kornmann stated in an order filed Tuesday that it’s likely the other federal judges in South Dakota will decline the case as well. If so, the chief judge for the 8th U.S. CIrcuit Court of Appeals will appoint a replacement judge.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Transportation officials will briefly shut down a section of the interstate in Nashville with a view of the July Fourth fireworks to prevent onlookers from putting themselves in danger. A news release from the Tennessee Department of Transportation said traffic will be diverted from the eastern portion of the downtown loop to the western portion to avoid illegal pedestrian use of the highway, stopped vehicles and a slowdown of traffic. Vehicles will not be allowed to enter Interstate 24 between Interstate 65 and Interstate 40 from 9 p.m. until 10 p.m. Sunday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Two mosquito trap samples collected in the cities of Granger and Taylor have tested positive for West Nile virus. The positive sample in Granger was taken from a trap site near N. Colorado Street, according to a news release on Thursday from the Williamson County and Cities Health District. The last time a positive sample was collected at this location was June 2, the release said. It said the positive sample in Taylor was taken from a trap site near Murphy Park on Veteran's Drive. This is the first time a positive sample has been collected at this location. The city of Taylor will spray insecticide in a 1-mile vicinity of the positive sample along the street right-of-way and in public parks on Friday and Saturday nights. The chemical used is a pyrethrin-based insecticide, the release said. Pyrethrin is a chemical that can be found in chrysanthemums. Taylor and Granger will do enhanced monitoring and testing, and increase public outreach and education, the release said. It said a West Nile infection might include fever, headache, and body aches, a skin rash on the trunk of the body and swollen lymph nodes. Those 50 and older and/or with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk for severe symptoms, which might include stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, vision loss, paralysis, and in rare cases, death, the release said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox and other local leaders urged state residents to forgo using personal fireworks this summer as the state faces a historic drought. Cox and more than 30 Utah city mayors and council members called on people to instead celebrate July Fourth and Pioneer Day – a holiday only celebrated in Utah every July 24 – at public celebrations sponsored by Utah communities. “With this year’s extremely dry conditions, all it takes is one spark to set off a life-threatening blaze,” Cox said. “We love our great nation and state, but there are much better ways to celebrate our independence and heritage than personal fireworks this year. Please celebrate safely!” Several Utah cities are banning people from setting off their own fireworks this year during the record drought, but many Republicans are against a statewide prohibition. Fireworks are banned on all state and unincorporated business lands, but Cox, a Republican, has said he does not have the legal authority to enact a statewide ban. Salt Lake City issued a fireworks ban and open burning ban last week, which prohibits people from starting any fires outside.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A number of walk-in clinics issuing COVID-19 vaccines, including some at Fourth of July celebrations, will be available throughout the weekend, Gov. Phil Scott said. “Even with our state’s high vaccination rate, we still need as many Vermonters as possible to protect themselves from COVID-19 by getting vaccinated,” Scott said in a statement. More than 452,000 of Vermont residents, or 82.1% , have already received at least one dose of vaccine. Venues include a skate park, a church, and a flea market. On Sunday, the holiday, eight pop-up clinics are scheduled throughout the state. The Barton Fairgrounds, the Stowe Independence Day Celebration, and the Champlain Valley Expo are among the clinic sites. Most pharmacies in Vermont are offering walk-in vaccinations, as well.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Acting U.S. Attorney For the Eastern District of Virginia Raj Parekh announced Thursday the creation of a civil rights unit within the office’s criminal division. Prosecutors assigned to the unit will investigate hate crimes, bias-related incidents, and alleged law enforcement misconduct, among other crimes.“Every individual has the right to enjoy their lives free from violence or discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other protected basis,” Parekh said in a written statement. The unit’s creation builds on the establishment last year of a civil rights unit that focused primarily on civil matters related to the rights of military service members and those with disabilities. Parekh said the unit’s creation is also in line with mandates from Attorney General Merrick Garland to respond more vigorously to allegations of hate crimes and other bias-related incidents. The Eastern District of Virginia is headquartered in Alexandria and has offices in Richmond, Newport News and Norfolk.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The rolling blackouts that cut electricity for tens of thousands of Spokane residents amid this week’s record-breaking heat wave mostly hit the same power customers repeatedly because of strains on equipment that couldn’t handle the blistering temperatures, utility officials said. And there was plenty of power available for customers in Spokane despite increased demand. That’s in contrast to the blackouts imposed in Texas last winter amid freezing temperatures, when there wasn’t enough electricity to meet the demand, and during a hot spell in California last summer. In Spokane, Avita Utilities officials blamed lack of transmission capacity combined with heat strain on equipment for their decision to impose the blackouts as the city’s 217,000 people endured sweltering heat that hit a record of 109 degrees Fahrenheit on Tuesday. Some people in the city never had their power cut while those unlucky enough to live in neighborhoods with equipment affected by the heat were targeted with blackouts that hit some repeatedly, said Heather Rosentrater, Avista’s senior vice president for energy delivery. “We haven’t been able to spread where those outages are occurring across different customers,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCarrollton: A covered bridge that’s on the National Register of Historic Places might soon be restored to repair damage caused by a fire in 2017. The Carrollton Covered Bridge in Barbour County had much of its outer covering destroyed in the fire, which was determined to be arson, the state Transportation Department said. The basic structure was left mostly intact. The state reopened the bridge to traffic after minor repairs were made following the fire, and it was decided last fall that the Division of Highways could do the restoration work. Tiger Diversified LLC in Upshur County was awarded a contract in May for the timber for the project. The state received a bid of $400,000 last week for the scaffolding and rigging system, the Transportation Department said. Restoration work could begin quickly if the bid is accepted, District 7 Engineer Brian Cooper said in a news release. The 140-foot-long bridge was built in 1856 and crosses the Buckhannon River near Carrollton.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wisconsin environmental officials have given the city of Waukesha final approval to withdraw water from Lake Michigan. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources announced Thursday it issued final approval for the withdraw on Wednesday. The city is expected to start pulling water from the lake in 2023. The city asked regulators in 2010 for permission to divert up to 8.2 million gallons from the lake daily for public use because city wells are contaminated with radium and return treated wastewater to the lake. The request triggered a lengthy review process under the Great Lakes Compact, an agreement between eight Great Lakes states that controls the use of lake water. The Compact Council approved the request in 2016.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A Wyoming man killed himself after authorities began searching his property for a woman missing since 2017. Authorities started searching the Sublette County property of Darrell “Pete” Petry on June 19, seeking evidence related to the disappearance of Vanessa “Nessy” Orren, 61, of LaBarge. Petry left the property on the second day of the search and was later found dead, Sublette County sheriff’s officials said in a statement Wednesday. Investigators determined Petry died by suicide. Sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Travis Bingham declined to release more details because the case was still under investigation, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. “He wasn’t under arrest at the time,” Bingham said. “He was still free to come and go.” Orren’s disappearance was still being investigated and anyone with information should call investigators at (307) 367-4378, sheriff’s officials said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/30/two-headed-turtle-quake-off-oregon-hungry-sharks-and-gators-news-from-around-our-50-states/40046419/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFairhope: Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that a proposed Mobile Bay toll bridge is “dead” after Baldwin County officials took a decisive stand against the controversial proposal to build one of the nation’s largest bridges. The Eastern Shore Metropolitan Planning Organization voted 8-1 on Wednesday night to remove the bridge from the area’s transportation plan. The project must be in the plan detailing the region’s transportation priorities to qualify for federal funding. The planning group’s decision came after a four-hour meeting in which some residents in Baldwin County expressed outrage over the tolls that could cost up to $6 each way. They described how the cost would make it a struggle to travel to jobs or care for aging relatives on the opposite side of the bay. The crowd applauded after the vote, according to video streamed by news outlets. The proposed Interstate 10 bridge across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay would have spanned about 10 miles and soared hundreds of feet above the water near downtown. State officials had said the tolls were needed to finance the proposed $2.1 billion bridge.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state regulatory agency has proposed changes that would limit activities at city breweries and distilleries. The Juneau Empire reported Tuesday that the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has proposed changes to a state statute that would further prohibit onsite activities at alcohol manufacturing businesses. Officials said the regulation includes prohibiting breweries and distilleries from allowing festivals, games and competitions, classes, public parties, presentations or performances and other social gatherings advertised to the general public. Officials said a regulation draft was discussed in June 2018, and the change being considered is a revised proposal. Some owners oppose the changes saying it prohibits them from creating a new social space for the community. Officials said the plan is open to public comment through Oct. 4.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Severe weather roared back into the Phoenix area Wednesday night, bringing heavy rain to some areas, mostly on the Valley’s east side, along with wind, dust and lightning, which apparently triggered numerous tree fires. As of 9:30 p.m., the Phoenix Fire Department’s fire dispatch board showed more than 20 tree fire calls, most of them in the north or east Phoenix and Scottsdale, as storms converged into that area. In addition, at least three house fires in Phoenix were caused by lightning strikes. The National Weather Service said on Twitter that some of the storms were moving west and expected to converge over central or northern Phoenix as the night progresses. The storms began building late afternoon in areas of Gila County as they moved west through northwest Pinal County toward Maricopa County. Outflows from the storms began pushing their way into the far southeast Valley. The storms arrive amid one of the drier monsoon seasons in the Phoenix area in recent years. As of Wednesday, just .27 of an inch of rain had officially been recorded at Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: Authorities said a nearly seven-hour standoff at a home ended when state troopers shot and killed an armed man suspected of killing two women who were found dead in the front yard earlier that day. The State Police identified the man killed Tuesday night as 37-year-old Raymond Lewis Williams Jr. and the slain women as 40-year-old Christine Fulmer and 28-year-old Deanna Thomas Banks. Police said the women were found dead Tuesday in the front yard of Williams’ home in Helena-West Helena, about 100 miles east of Little Rock. The city’s police chief, James Patrick Smith, told Memphis, Tennessee, television station WMC that investigators believe Williams shot them before barricading himself inside. State Police said troopers tried to communicate with Williams for hours before they used tear gas in the home. They say Williams emerged from the home with a rifle and a shootout ensued, resulting in Williams’ death.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Coast Guard officials said they have seized $38.5 million worth of cocaine from suspected drug smugglers in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Robert Ward and another cutter recovered more than 2,800 pounds of pure, uncut cocaine in their latest busts. The Robert Ward returned to the Port of Los Angeles on Thursday after 50 days patrolling the coast off Central and South America. Authorities believe cartels have been smuggling the narcotics and said seizing the cocaine will save lives because the drugs won’t reach the streets.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: City officials are moving forward with plans to ban the sale of flavored electronic cigarette products containing nicotine. The Daily Camera reported the City Council on Wednesday also completed plans to raise the minimum purchasing age to 21 for tobacco and nicotine products. Only tobacco-flavored vaping products will be allowed under the new rules. The city will also ask voters on the November ballot to approve a 40% sales tax on e-cigarette products. The town of Carbondale earlier this week also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarette and tobacco products. The town will require tobacco retailers to be licensed, and it will raise the minimum purchasing age to 21.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A report predicts a major increase in demand for home care for older residents and people with disabilities. The analysis was conducted by Mercer Human Services Consulting, a firm retained by the Department of Social Services to help plan for future Medicaid-funded services. It projects the growing demand for alternatives to institutional care will lead to excess capacity in nursing homes, reducing need by nearly 6,000 beds by 2040. Office of Policy and Management Secretary Melissa McCaw said Connecticut has been “moving in the right direction on long-term care for a number of years,” including various Medicaid-funded services to help people live at home. McCaw said the state must “continue to adapt” and make sure policies also address excess capacity at nursing facilities, which will still be needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Authorities found no evidence of hazardous chemicals or substances at a bank that was evacuated after five people complained of headaches and a strong chemical smell. New Castle County Emergency Management coordinator Dave Carpenter Jr. told The News Journal of Wilmington that the manager of the PNC Bank in New Castle evacuated the building early Monday after the people developed headaches. Hazmat teams from local agencies and the state Department of Natural Resources responded to the scene. Carpenter said state and local authorities said they didn’t detect any harmful substances in the bank. No one was hospitalized, and state authorities said they planned to retest the building to determine the source of the strong chemical smell. It’s unclear if they found the source.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C., agencies knew a row house that appeared to be illegally rented had “life safety violations” for months before a fire killed two tenants last week. City Administrator Rashad M. Young told reporters Tuesday a police officer complained about the home to the city and fire department in March, prompting a city inspector to visit it. He said the inspector never gained entry and contacted the home’s owner, but neither agency fully probed the officer’s complaint. Four workers from the agencies are now on leave. The U.S. attorney’s office is investigating. The officer’s complaint “strongly recommended” inspectors investigate an apparently unlicensed rooming house with possible fire code violations. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: Authorities said a surfer caught air on a wave and landed on a shark that, in turn, bit him on the hand and calf. Donald Walsh told The Daytona Beach News-Journal that he had been surfing at New Smyrna Beach for several hours Tuesday when he decided to try going airborne before leaving for the day. Ocean Rescue Capt. Tamra Malphurs said that’s when Walsh landed on the 6.5-foot shark in waist-deep water and suffered cuts that weren’t considered life-threatening. Walsh, 40, said he didn’t see the shark below him as he landed in the water, but the shark’s bite brought it into focus. Walsh said he will be back in the water as soon as his wounds heal a bit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: A kayaker said he could only think of paddling faster after realizing he wasn’t alone in a pond. Bo Storey told WRDW-TV, “I just paddled and paddled. …” on Monday to get away from a 10-foot, 360-pound alligator that got as close as 5 feet from the back of his kayak. News outlets reported Richmond County deputies received a call from Storey saying he was being chased by the behemoth. Storey was practicing for a bass fishing tournament. Deputies arrived on the scene and wrestled the massive gator with help from hunter Trey Durant and his friend Robby Amerson. The alligator was clearly not afraid of humans and was deemed a nuisance so it was legally killed by Durant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The reopening of the USS Arizona Memorial has been scheduled for Labor Day weekend following a 15-month closure. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that walk-on access to the memorial will begin Sunday. A malfunction with the concrete dock’s anchoring system forced the closure of the memorial to foot traffic beginning in May 2018. Exceptionally high tides in 2017 are believed to have dislodged concrete blocks sunk into the sediment of Pearl Harbor and connected by chains to the dock. Park employees last week installed a visitor ramp for walk-on visits to the 105-foot floating dock and reinstalled the memorial’s bridge spanning 30 feet and weighing 4 tons. Officials said the repair project has cost more than $2.1 million.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gallagher, a comedian known for smashing fruit and vegetables with giant wooden hammers, said he was escorted out of Idaho’s Statehouse when he entered the building carrying two of the hammers. Gallagher told the Idaho Statesman in a story Wednesday that he was looking for the state’s film office on Monday for a possible project. The state doesn’t have a film office. A person who answered the phone at the state agency that provides security said Wednesday that no one was available to comment. The 73-year-old comedian who rose to fame in the 1980s said he’s in Boise to scout locations for a film about an ancient poet. He also said he would like to build a retirement project in the area where old celebrities could live among regular folks.\n\nIllinois\n\nArlington Heights: The owner of Arlington International Racecourse has announced the company will not seek a license to add casino gambling at the track. Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen on Wednesday said state law requiring the track to dedicate a portion of casino earnings to racing purses makes placing casino games at the suburban Chicago track untenable. Carstanjen noted Arlington would enter the gambling market with a tax rate that would be approximately 17.5% to 20% higher than the existing Chicago-area casinos because of contributions to the thoroughbred purse account. Churchill Downs also owns a majority interest in Rivers Casino in nearby Des Plaines. Carstanjen also said horse racing at Arlington is guaranteed until 2021, after which the company might move to a track at another location in Illinois. The Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association said the decision on casinos by Churchill Downs means the company is snubbing the men and women of thoroughbred horse racing.\n\nIndiana\n\nMadison:The Ku Klux Klan is planning a second annual “kookout” in Madison for Saturday, an event that was met last year with hundreds of protesters. The group plans to hold the event at Jaycee Park from 1-3 p.m. on Saturday on the riverfront, according to an event flier. The flyer for the event reads “Make America Safe! Make America Drug Free! Make America White! Make America Great! Take a Stand!!! Join the Klan!!!” And at the bottom of the page, “Never! Never! Apologize for Being White!” About 300 people protested last year’s event, saying the Klan’s message was divisive and not welcome in their town. Residents from surrounding towns have said they don’t want to be associated with the KKK. After World War I, Indiana was a platform for the “most powerful Ku Klux Klan,” according to the Indiana State Library’s website. Madison, named after the country’s fourth president, is about an hour’s drive northeast from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIowa\n\nClive:City officials now know what caused a portion of Walnut Creek to turn bright green. A water sample collected on Tuesday showed traces of cyanobacteria, which can produce the cyanotoxin microcystin, a news release said Thursday. However, the sample collected was within the allowable range for safe water recreation. The concentration of the microcystin was 2.9 ug/L. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources posts beach advisories for concentration levels greater than 20 ug/L and the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Advisory Level is 8 ug/L. Because the bloom is ongoing and there could be areas in the water where microcystin are more concentrated, the city recommends people and pets stay out of the discolored water until the algae bloom subsides.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence Humane Society has trapped the first feral cats under a program designed to manage the wild cat population. The Community Cat Program traps, neuters and vaccinates feral cats and returns them to the areas where they were found. As part of the program, the shelter clips the ear of a cat when it’s neutered so animal control will not pick it up again. Kirk Putman, the Humane Society’s interim director, said that the shelter trapped a total of 15 cats in two separate efforts in the last week. The organization is asking for volunteers and donations to help with the program. Previously, the city had not allowed cats to roam free. The Lawrence Journal-World reported the program went into effect May 1, despite opposition from some citizens.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A U.S. sailor from Kentucky who died at Pearl Harbor will be buried in his hometown this fall. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said 25-year-old Navy Machinist’s Mate 1st Class Ulis C. Steely of Corbin was assigned to the USS Oklahoma battleship when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft on Dec. 7, 1941. He was among 429 crewmen killed. Most of the remains were not identified at the time. Unidentified remains have been buried in Hawaii. The agency said in 2015 it exhumed unknown remains from the USS Oklahoma for analysis. Using dental and anthropological analysis, as well as DNA, Steely’s remains were identified last fall. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office said he would order flags lowered to half-staff in Steely’s honor on Oct. 5, the date of his funeral.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The police department has authorized a minor uniform change as the city prepares for an annual festival of gay culture in the French Quarter. A department news release said that some officers will be sporting “Pride Edition Badges” during Southern Decadence, which began Thursday and runs through the Labor Day weekend. The special badge is designed like the department’s traditional badge, a star framed by a crescent. But this star is rainbow-striped. The department said the badge was introduced in June to mark Pride Month when it was made available as an option for officers to purchase and wear. It can be worn again during the weekend Southern Decadence Festival. The department said it will also be an option during future Pride Month and Southern Decadence celebrations.\n\nMaine\n\nWaldoboro: Fishery regulators are postponing a round of meetings with lobstermen in the state aimed at preparing for potential new restrictions designed to protect endangered whales. Department of Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said the department hasn’t set dates yet for any new meetings. The meetings were set to start in September. A federal government team called for the removal of many vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales, which number about 400. The state held a series of meetings with lobstermen about the new rules earlier this year. The last took place in late June. Nicholas said the commissioner wants to do another review of right whale and lobster industry data before presenting a plan about the next steps to the industry.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials have decided to use $6 million in park and public facility funds to help pay for the recovery of a ransomware attack that crippled the city for weeks. The Baltimore Sun reported the city’s spending panel voted Wednesday to use the funds for recovery and “hardening of the environment.” A May ransomware attack on city computer servers is estimated to have cost Baltimore about $18.2 million in restoration costs and delayed or lost revenue. The attack came about a year after one hit Baltimore’s 911 system. Mayor Bernard C. Young has said Baltimore might purchase insurance against hackers. The spending panel delayed a vote Wednesday on an $835,000 contract for $20 million in cyber liability coverage. Young said the two panel members need to be briefed on the proposal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The governors of five East Coast states, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, are urging federal regulators not to put any additional roadblocks in the way of the country’s nascent offshore wind industry. The governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Virginia said in a letter Tuesday to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that offshore wind power will help strengthen America’s energy independence while creating thousands of jobs. The group said they’re disappointed by a recent decision to delay final permitting of the planned 84-turbine Vineyard Wind project. The group urged federal overseers to give the project a green light by next March. An Interior Department spokeswoman said the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is working to develop a permitting timeline for the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State regulators and Native American tribes are temporarily removing juvenile lake sturgeon from two Michigan rivers to protect them from chemical treatments targeting sea lampreys. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service treats rivers in the Great Lakes region to kill invasive lampreys. It doesn’t harm most fish. But when the treatments are applied in the Big Manistee and Muskegon rivers, lake sturgeon are at risk. Over the next two months, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Gun Lake Tribe will join the state Department of Natural Resources to catch juvenile sturgeon and keep them in rearing facilities until the treatments are completed. Afterward, they’ll be released. During the last sea lamprey treatment on the Big Manistee River three years ago, 117 lake sturgeon were collected and released.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Clean-up after a July fire at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School will delay the start of the school year. “The turnaround time is just not fast enough,” said Kelly Vangsness, principal at the south side parochial school. The first day of school was scheduled for Aug. 26, but in early August, the administration pushed the first day to Sept. 4, which is the first day of school for most students in the St. Cloud school district. Continued clean-up has delayed the first day – again – to Monday, Sept. 9, Vangsness said Tuesday. The school was damaged by a July 4 fire that started in a light fixture that had been updated with LED bulbs, according to St. Cloud police. No one was inside the building at the time and the fire was isolated to the vestibule area and adjoining hallway, including the ceiling above that area. Painting and carpet installation is expected to be completed by Sept. 4, Vangsness said, but the administration is waiting for the installation of the fire system and for state officials to sign off on an asbestos abatement.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi said it’s moving ahead with plans to transfer a Confederate soldier monument from its central location on campus to a spot near a secluded Confederate cemetery. In an email sent to students, faculty and staff, interim Chancellor Larry Sparks wrote that the university submitted plans Tuesday to take down, move and reassemble the monument. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History must review and approve the university’s plans. College Board trustees, who govern Mississippi’s eight public universities, must also approve the move. Sparks agreed in March to calls from faculty, students and staff to move the marble soldier and base from near the school’s historic heart. The monument has stood sentry there since 1906, when the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned it. The monument is 29 feet tall and weighs 40,000 pounds. Plans call for moving it outside a cemetery in a less prominent area of the campus that holds graves of Confederate soldiers killed in the battle of Shiloh. A new concrete walkway would be built leading to the cemetery, with the monument installed along with it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Commuters who prefer to cross the Mississippi River on the Martin Luther King Bridge will have to wait quite a while longer for the bridge to reopen. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that flooding this spring and summer has delayed a construction project on the bridge that closed in August of last year. It was originally expected to reopen this fall. Now, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the bridgework won’t be complete until next summer. IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said the flooding impacted train routes. He said the diverted trains were rerouted to tracks under the bridge project, preventing IDOT from being able to safely remove a section of the existing bridge. The construction work is on the Illinois side.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A fire burning in grass and shrubs northwest of Billings has led to the evacuation of about 15 residences near the community of Molt. The Billings Gazette reported the fire started Wednesday and had burned up to an estimated 15 square miles by Thursday morning. Yellowstone County Commissioner Dennis Pitman said residents were watching the fire Wednesday night when the wind changed direction, sending the flames toward homes and prompting the evacuations. No structures have been damaged and fire crews were protecting homes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpencer: Drinking water is being restored in Boyd County after a disastrous flood washed out a water main in March. The Omaha World-Herald reported that workers began installing a new pipe beneath the Niobrara River on Tuesday. Boyd County Rural Water District officials said water could be provided to Spencer, Lynch, Anoka and nearby farms in about two weeks. Potable water will not be available until testing and sanitation work is complete. The district has provided no timeline. The water district has refurbished three irrigation wells to provide water temporarily for showering, washing and toilets, and it has been distributing free bottled water. Rex Black, the water district board chairman, said restoring water service will cost about $2 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover 75% of that.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Las Vegas-area teachers’ union has struck a teacher pay deal Wednesday with the country’s fifth-largest school district that organizers said will avert a threatened strike Sept. 10. Members of the Clark County Education Association threatened to walk off the job next month over a dispute about paying teachers more for continuing education. Union leaders and the Clark County School District announced at a news conference late Wednesday that the district will fund the salary increase for continuing education, in addition to honoring a commitment for 3% raises and more money for health insurance. The deal came days after the school district filed an emergency court motion to block the strike and have a judge issue an order against it. If the order was imposed, the striking union could have faced fines of up to $50,000 a day. The deal still needs to be ratified by the union’s executives and the school district’s trustees, but both sides say they expect that will happen soon.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Castle Island: Some residents are protesting a plan to recruit archers to kill as many as 20 deer on New Castle Island. News outlets are reporting that nearly 2,000 residents have signed a petition opposing the plan proposed by condo managers of Wentworth by the Sea to stop deer from eating private gardens. Residents estimated there are about 24 deer total on the island. They said they like the animals and don’t want them killed. The Portsmouth Herald reported that some residents said the plan is not a hunt but “a kill” because the archers will take aim from tree stands while the deer feed. The condo association hasn’t responded to requests for comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEwing Township: The state has honored a team that competed in the Little League World Series after winning the state and Mid-Atlantic championships. Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan hosted the Elmora Troopers and their families Thursday at the State Police Museum in Ewing. Elizabeth’s Elmora Youth League team is named in honor of Trooper Thomas Hanratty, who was struck and killed during a traffic stop in 1992. Hanratty played baseball for the league and players wear a patch with his badge number. The Troopers were knocked out of the double-elimination Little League World Series tournament last week by a team from Louisiana that went on to win the championship.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Investigators have determined a fireworks explosion that killed a firefighter and severely injured another was accidental. Roswell firefighters were packaging fireworks on June 5 for the city’s Independence Day celebration when the explosion happened, the Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday. The city’s fire department has organized the event in recent years. The blast led to the death of Jeff Stroble, 46, on July 21. Hoby Bonham, 36, was sent home from the hospital in late June. Ten other firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The firefighters were handling the fireworks inside a concrete building at the Roswell International Air Center. They were fusing aerial shell fireworks with electric matches when one went off, the report from the state fire marshal’s office states. Investigators from state agencies and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted in the investigation. The city declined to comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The second span of the new Kosciuszko Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens has opened to traffic. The span opened early Thursday. A ceremony on Wednesday night included a light show with music from Billy Joel via satellite from Madison Square Garden. The bridge features five Queens-bound traffic lanes and four Brooklyn-bound lanes, as well as a 20-foot-wide pedestrian and bicycle pathway. A 7-acre site beneath the bridge in Brooklyn will be turned into a public space and park. The first part of the new bridge was completed in April 2017. The $873 million project is the first major bridge built in New York City since the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. The original Kosciuszko Bridge opened in 1939.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man’s body has been exhumed from a gravesite on a court order after a funeral home discovered it mistakenly sold the same plot twice. WRAL reported Kizzie Sewell bought a plot at Montlawn Cemetery in Raleigh for her husband, Winfred Barnes, upon his death in 2014. But last year, Sewell said Montlawn informed her they realized they had sold her husband’s plot to another customer who started paying for it six months before Barnes was buried there. On Wednesday, Barnes’ body was dug up after five years in the plot. A judge ruled the man with the original contract was entitled to the site. Montlawn said in a statement to the outlet that they abided by the court order.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion Wednesday to intervene on a proposed expansion of the Dakota Access pipeline that would double the line’s capacity. The tribe, which led original opposition to the crude oil pipeline, petitioned for status as an intervenor in the case before the Public Service Commission arguing its “interests … are not adequately represented.” North Dakota regulators have set a Nov. 13 public hearing on the proposed expansion. The public hearing, which was requested by the tribe and the Sierra Club, will be held in the south-central city of Linton, near where a pump station would go in to increase the line’s capacity.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Cincinnati Metro could be out of the streetcar business by New Year’s Day. On Wednesday, City Manager Patrick Duhaney released a 25-page “Cincinnati Streetcar Transition Plan” that details the timeline and who will be responsible for what during the separation. The target date is “on or around” Jan. 1, according to the plan. The separation is expected to cost around $553,000, which would come from the streetcar’s budget. As is, the Cincinnati Bell Connector has a complicated management structure. The city owns it, but Metro oversees it. Metro, in turn, contracts with a private company called Transdev to run the streetcar day-to-day. With the divorce, the city would take over complete management of the streetcar, cutting out Metro as a middleman. Transdev would carry on with day-to-day operations. The city administration is expected to present its financial plan for the separation during a city council meeting on Sept. 4.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWebber Falls: One of two runaway barges that crashed into a dam and sank on top of the other in the Arkansas River has been removed from the dam. The barges carrying a total of about 3,800 pounds of fertilizer sank May 23 after crashing into the lock and dam at Webbers Falls, about 70 miles southeast of Tulsa. They had broken free from their mooring at the Port of Muskogee during historic spring flooding that waterlogged much of the Midwest down into Arkansas. Port manager Fred Taylor said Tuesday it could take several weeks to completely remove both barges, which are to be used for scrap. The McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System runs from Tulsa to the Mississippi River and has been closed to barge traffic since the flooding began.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Thursday off the Oregon coast but did not generate a tsunami or cause any damage or injuries, authorities said. The epicenter of the quake, which hit just after 8 a.m., was located about 150 miles from land at a depth of 7 miles in the Pacific Ocean. The quake was caused by slipping along an offshore fault called the Blanco Fracture Zone and has nothing to do with the more well-known Cascadia fault, which is believed to be overdue for a major earthquake in the Pacific Northwest, said Paul Bodin, manager of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington. The event is also unrelated to a cluster of “episodic slips” along the Cascadia tectonic plate boundary that have been releasing energy across the coastal Pacific Northwest over the past week to 10 days, he said. Those slips are not felt by humans but have been picked up by monitoring devices around the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington state and also stretching from Eugene to the Siskiyou Mountains along the Oregon-California border, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials are hoping to lower the risk of lead poisoning through mandated blood testing for children and other measures. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is backing legislation to require testing that meets federal guidelines and is rolling out other strategies to address the problem. The administration is working on ways for regional response teams to care for children with dangerous amounts of lead in their system. There are also proposals to train more people in remediating lead and to provide more resources online about lead poisoning, testing and remediation. Officials said about 3 in 10 children in the state have been tested for lead exposure, and just under 5% had elevated lead levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are facing about an 8% hike in their electricity bills beginning in October after state regulators approved a rate increase. WPRI-TV reported that the cost increase affects National Grid’s residential electricity customers, who on average will pay about $9 more per month for at least the next six months. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, which decides whether to approve or deny rate changes, also approved rate increases for commercial and industrial customers on Wednesday. The higher costs are typical during the winter months when generating electricity becomes more expensive. The commission’s decision was made without objection or controversy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A group that monitors sea turtles has reported finding a two-headed loggerhead hatchling. News outlets reported Sea Turtle Patrol Hilton Head Island said the hatchling was found alive Tuesday and released into the ocean. The group’s leader, marine biologist Amber Kuehn, said a genetic mutation caused the second head on the turtle, since named Squirt and Crush. The group shared a picture of the turtle on Facebook on Wednesday that showed the creature’s small body partially eclipsed by a gloved hand. The post wished the turtle good luck. Kuehn said Crush and Squirt couldn’t really swim, as the heads controlled separate flippers and weren’t working together.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem and Oglala Lakota County school officials plan to partner on building the first local public high school on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Noem said Thursday that building a career and technical education high school in Oglala Lakota County “will bolster the area’s workforce” and “empower students with real-life skills and career opportunities.” The school district serves 22 communities and operates from virtual locations that can serve 50 to 250 students at a time. The only other high schools on the reservation are private or federal Bureau of Indian Education schools. District superintendent Anthony Fairbanks said building a physical high school will “create a launchpad for our students’ career development.” The school is scheduled to open in August 2020 and enroll about 400 students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Former Gov. Bill Haslam isn’t ruling out a future run for office, though he said he isn’t planning on it. During an event alongside former GOP Sen. Bob Corker, Haslam said he would be sad if he never serves in some kind of public role again. Haslam told reporters it was a hard decision, but the right one, not to run to replace retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander in 2020. President Donald Trump tweeted last month that former Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty would launch a Senate bid and endorsed him. Haslam said he’s “really excited” about the presumed Republican run by Hagerty, Haslam’s ex-economic development commissioner. Corker said he wants to let the race evolve, saying he’s friends with Hagerty and trauma surgeon Manny Sethi, another Republican who has launched a campaign.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A nonprofit that advocates for children said the rate of student suspensions has fallen by nearly a third since the state implemented a law barring suspensions except in extreme circumstances. The 2017 Texas law permits suspensions for major violations such as assault or bringing a weapon or drugs to school. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas public schools suspended more than 101,000 students in prekindergarten to second grade during the 2015-16 school year. Texans Care for Children released a report Wednesday revealing that those figures dropped by 31% to 70,197 in the 2017-18 school year. Youngsters in foster care, black children and those in special education are more likely to be suspended.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials are unveiling a gun safety program aimed at preventing accidental shootings that will be optional for schools. The program had been mandated three years ago by state lawmakers who have consistently rejected gun-control measures. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said Thursday at a news conference that the program avoids the politically sensitive issues of gun policy and instead acknowledges that many children are bound to come across guns in a state where an estimated 4 in 10 households have a firearm. Utah is also one of several states that allow teachers with concealed carry permit holders to carry guns in schools. The program features a 5-minute video and would be taught to children in 5th through 12th grades by law enforcement officers who already work with students. School districts will have to approve the course, and parents will have to provide written permission.\n\nVermont\n\nOrange: A farmer said most of the 250 pigs that escaped from his fenced-in area earlier this month are back. Walter Jeffries of Sugar Mountain Farm in Orange said Thursday the fence has been fixed. Jeffries said roughly 50 adults and 200 piglets escaped after fencing was damaged by vandals. He said 99% of the pigs have been wrangled. He and workers placed a trail of hamburger and hot dog buns to lure the stragglers. Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said his agency provided Jeffries guidance on how to remedy the problem.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A power company is launching an initiative to provide electric school buses to school districts in Virginia. Dominion Energy said in a statement Thursday that electric buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save school districts money. Dominion said the initial phase of the program aims to put 50 electric buses in its Virginia service territory by the end of 2020. The company hopes to expand the program with state approval to bring 1,000 electric school buses online by 2025. Dominion said it hopes to replace all diesel buses. It said replacing one is like taking 5.2 cars off the road. The company said bus manufacturers will be able to submit bids to build the buses. School districts will be able express interest in participating in the program.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A radio station has returned on air nearly a year after burglars robbed the station of essential production equipment. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported that KYNR 1490-AM station on the Yakama Indian Reservation hosted its first shows Thursday using a makeshift system. Authorities said burglars took the station’s control board, microphones, printers and the emergency alert system in October. Station hosts said they are still waiting for a replacement control board after the first new one had programming issues. Hosts said a mixing board that relies on analog radio transmission allowed the station to get back on the air for now, but with fewer channels. Authorities said the Federal Communications Commission wanted to know whether the theft was an attempt to impede the station’s ability to inform the public.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will work with the investigative division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fight the opioid crisis. The Herald-Dispatch reported Sen. Shelley Moore Capito announced Wednesday the partnership between Marshall University and Homeland Security Investigations. Capito said the school will receive more than $4 million to develop a tool to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity related to opioids. John Sammons, director of Marshall University’s digital forensics and information assurance program, said students, faculty and staff are looking forward to the project because they’ve seen the impact of the epidemic in their community. Sammons said the partnership will focus on transnational criminal activity, including cybercrimes.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State officials said the gray wolf population might have stabilized after nearing extinction decades ago. The state Department of Natural Resources said it counted from 914 to 978 wolves in the year to April 2019. The agency said that is a 1% increase from the last count. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that state data shows there were just 25 wolves in Wisconsin 1980. A federal judge placed the gray wolf on the endangered species list in 2014. The federal government this year launched an effort to delist it. Adrian Treves, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Wisconsin hasn’t been transparent with its count and that the federal government shouldn’t rely on the state’s numbers. The DNR stands by the count.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. bankruptcy court has ruled that a coal company can sell two large Wyoming mines separately from one in West Virginia. Contura Energy originally sought to buy all three mines from Blackjewel in a deal held up while U.S. officials seek payment of federal royalties. Contura would have paid $9.7 million for the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mines in Wyoming and Pax Surface Mine in West Virginia. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that the court in West Virginia on Wednesday approved a deal in which Contura would pay $1.1 million to complete the sale of the West Virginia mine. The Wyoming mines have been shut down since Blackjewel declared bankruptcy July 1. Federal records show no production at the West Virginia mine since 2006.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/06/01/corridor-death-jumping-worms-dolphin-danger-news-around-states/50310719/", "title": "'Corridor of death', jumping worms, dolphin danger: News from ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: In what’s being touted as a major victory for clean water advocates, a Birmingham-based coal company has agreed to meet environmentalists’ demands and clean up an abandoned mine site on the Locust Fork tributary of the Black Warrior River. A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/indianapolis/2022/06/27/indystars-317-project-stories-all-indianapolis-neighborhoods/7704062001/", "title": "IndyStar's 317 Project: Stories of all of Indianapolis' neighborhoods", "text": "In October 2021, we embarked on IndyStar's 317 Project.

Two cottages, bright blue and muted mauve, sit side by side.\n\nBut the houses' defining accessory is a tunnel connecting the two dwellings like hands clasped and connected. It's a unique feature even in a neighborhood full of historic homes.\n\nHelen Small, who currently lives in one of the homes, said the story goes back decades.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn Martindale-Brightwood, an alternative to a junkyard awaits car lovers\n\nTheir hands are caked in grime as they wrench at the car. Their toolbox sits nearby. They’ve spent hours at the yard, but for regulars at the Pull-A-Part in Martindale-Brightwood, the end result is worth it.\n\nEvery day, customers take their pick of car parts among the sea of automobiles — however obscure. The only catch: They need to remove the pieces themselves. Two dollars is all one needs to get into the yard. For those who find what they want, they’ll pay a reasonable price versus what they’d pay for a new part.\n\nPrindell Young said that’s part of the appeal. But mostly, he enjoys the do-it-yourself spirit.\n\nRead more here.\n\nTha Corn Man fires up Mexican street corn in Fall Creek Place food truck\n\nShrouded in charcoal smoke in a Dollar General lot, Timmy Campbell is trying to start his generator.\n\nThe Houston native is, to his loyal customers in Fall Creek Place, just Tha Corn Man. “Hey Corn Man!” they’d call out. His food truck’s front plate reads: Corny. He calls his 10-year-old daughter “the Corn Cob Kid.”\n\nThe love for elotes sprung from his Texas childhood, when Mexican street corn was abundant at food trucks. Then came the Gary of his teens, when Campbell would wake up to the corn man’s bell ringing down the street.\n\nRead more here.\n\nHe'd fish in the Amazon if he could, but this Crossfield pond has something more unique\n\nThe pond is still, and green. The grass around it has been tamed by mowers. It's guarded by tract homes on one side and a 2-way road on the other. No towering forests, or White River-like currents.\n\nBut the fishing is decent, and that’s enough. Soon, when the weather warms, the young fishers of Crossfield will bike out here with their poles and toss lines into the water.\n\n“It’s run by the kids around here,” Matthew Danz, 19, says, as he watches his bobber – a dot asleep on the surface. Waiting for it to talk to him.\n\nRead more here.\n\nIndy's Irish Ink, where art meets pain therapy\n\nHannah McKenry has a good feeling about turning 27.

But on South Franklin Road in Indianapolis' Raymond Park neighborhood, hidden behind a house, is a Buddhist temple and sculpture garden.\n\nThe Phap An Temple made the eastside community home a few years ago. When they bought the football-field-sized lot, it was overgrown and full of brush, said Deborah Nguyen, a Temple member.

For one resident, a comforting constant remains\n\n“I just like roosters,” smiled Debra Hancock in a poultry-themed purple hoodie. They've been a familiar presence to her since childhood.\n\nWhen little, she traveled every summer to her grandmother’s house in Arkansas. There chickens roamed freely, and her family pitched in helping to prepare them for mealtimes. Debra’s responsibility was to pluck feathers, a job she hated, but the trips were fun.\n\nA lifelong resident of Drexel Gardens, Hancock has witnessed her neighborhood undergo dramatic changes. There to witness them are a constant and comforting assortment of chicken figurines she keeps in her yard, including a 6-foot-tall rooster statue her granddaughter calls, \"the chicken.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nIn this Meridian Hills kindergarten classroom, children learn how to communicate and express their feelings\n\nChildren at the Meridian Hills Cooperative Nursery School & Kindergarten learn strategies to deal with their feelings, impulse control and communication which helps them in a classroom setting.

Or perhaps, when you walk further in, you might marvel at the room full of doors, the shelf of neon letters or the stack of windows in the basement.\n\nThe antique store was opened 12 years ago by Tim Harmon, 70, and his wife, Julie Crow. Though Julie has since retired, she sold her share of the store to Karla Folker, 32, and Katie Kelly, 27.

More than a dozen embassies around the globe have confirmed victims from their country.\n\nWhat caused Saturday’s surge is unclear, but witnesses say partygoers were packed tightly into narrow streets in the capital’s nightlife district of Itaewon, as people enjoyed the first Halloween weekend since Covid-19 restrictions were lifted.\n\nNearly all of the victims – at least 150 – have been identified; police told CNN. The toll included 56 men and 97 women, South Korea’s Interior and Safety Ministry reported.\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Education said Monday that six school students were among the dead, including one in middle school. Three teachers also died.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. local time Sunday (4 a.m. ET), the number of people injured had risen to 133, of whom 37 were seriously injured, the ministry said.\n\nRescue officials and police gather in the district of Itaewon following the crush. Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“There were rows and rows of people with tarps covering them in the street,” Emily Farmer, a 27-year-old English teacher in Seoul who was passing through Itaewon, told CNN.\n\nFarmer and her friends were “overwhelmed” by the crowds on the street and decided to enter a bar. Shortly after, rumors started spreading that somebody had died and patrons were not allowed to leave. Farmer said she received an emergency message from the government alerting them to “a dangerous situation in the area,” and later was allowed to leave the bar, when she discovered the scale of the tragedy.\n\n“It was horrible,” she said. “Not everyone died instantly.” Groups of people were crying, she added. Many victims were receiving CPR and had their costumes taken off to allow medics at the scene to resuscitate them. “They were still pulling people (out) because it was so crowded,” she added.\n\nAnother eyewitness, Sung Sehyun, told CNN that the street space was like a “jammed subway” on Saturday evening, with Halloween partygoers packed so tightly that it was difficult to move around.\n\nNationals from dozens of countries were among the dead. Jean Chung/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nSuah Cho added that people had started to push and shove, and there was a lot of screaming. She eventually managed to take a detour and fled to safety but had seen people climbing buildings to survive. She added that the costumes people were wearing added to the confusion; “there was also a police officer screaming but we couldn’t really tell (if it) was a real police officer because so many people were wearing costumes.”\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nFlowers have been laid at the scene of the disaster. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCrowds are not unusual for that area, or for Seoul residents, who are used to jam-packed subways and streets in a city of almost 10 million.\n\nAfter the first emergency calls came in around 10:24 p.m., authorities rushed to the scene – but the sheer volume of people made it difficult to reach those who needed help. Video posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical assistance.\n\nA number of countries, including the US, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway and France, have confirmed that their nationals were among the victims.\n\nA University of Kentucky nursing student is among the dead, according to a statement from university president Eli Capilouto.

The tech outage disrupted operations across industries such as banks, hospitals and 911 call centers, plus grounded flights and hampered public transit systems and. Although a fix was deployed to restore most systems by the afternoon to return to normal, ripple effects may be felt throughout the weekend, experts warn.\n\nCrowdStrike, which advertises being used by over half of Fortune 500 companies, said one of its recent content updates had a defect that impacted Microsoft's Windows Operating System, adding the incident was \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\n\"Earlier today, a CrowdStrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \"We are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, George Kurtz, apologized for the disruptions in a post on X, noting the issue has been identified and isolated and a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike is \"working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\" Meanwhile, Microsoft said, \"the underlying cause has been fixed\" and impacted Microsoft 365 apps and services have been recovered, though the company continues to monitor the issue.\n\nKurtz went on to warn in his statement, \"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\"\n\nIn the U.S., thousands of flights were canceled Friday morning. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were among those who grounded flights less than an hour after Microsoft said it resolved a cloud-services-related outage that impacted several low-cost carriers.\n\n“Every line is long,” said Chance Ortego, 31, whose flight to New York was canceled Friday morning.\n\nPublic transit systems in the U.S. also reported temporary impacts, but for the most part, trains and buses were running as scheduled. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in Washington, D.C., said its \"website and some of our internal systems are currently down,\" but trip-planning applications were later restored. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also said some of its MTA customer information systems were temporarily offline until around 5:30 p.m.\n\nAround the world, the outages disrupted London's Stock Exchange, caused major train delays in the U.K., sent British broadcaster Sky News off air, forced medical facilities in Europe and the U.S. to cancel some services and caused disruptions at airports in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\nWidespread economic impact from the outage is expected to be small, even though many companies were still trying to resume full operations by the time the stock market closed.\n\nTravel disruptions:Over 2,000 US flights canceled amid global IT outage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ More than 5,000 flights were canceled globally as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern, about 4.6% of all scheduled commercial flights for the day, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\n◾ Some U.S. border crossings saw impacts amid the outage: Traffic stalled on the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada, as well as at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, the Detroit Free Press reported. CBP One, the Customs and Border Patrol app, and the agency’s border wait times website, each appeared to experience outages.\n\n◾ U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, in the wake of the outage. CrowdStrike shares closed down 11.1% at $304.96, with analysts predicting the outage would cost the company money to fix and restore trust with its customers. It was the lowest close for the shares since May 2. Microsoft shares fared better, closing down only 0.74% at $437.11.\n\n◾ Krispy Kreme gave away free doughnuts Friday due to the global tech outage.\n\n◾ Some Starbucks locations were reportedly taking only cash Friday, and customers reported being unable to use the coffee chain's mobile app.\n\n◾ Some had a sense of humor through it, with workers who had to muddle through expressing their wishes for a digital snow day from the office − \"Knock Teams out\" − as the outage didn't equate to a work stoppage for all.\n\n◾ Dubai International Airport said on X it was operating normally following \"a global system outage that affected the check-in process for some airlines.\" It added the affected airlines \"promptly switched to an alternate system, allowing normal check-in operations to resume swiftly.\"\n\nCrowdStrike impact:How a global IT outage unraveled the world's tech\n\nHow the CrowdStrike outage played out throughout the day:\n\nPortland issues emergency declaration\n\nPortland, Oregon, Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration Friday over the tech outage, with a statement noting the outages are affecting city servers, employee computers and emergency communications.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maryland Department of Emergency Management increased its state activation level from \"normal\" to \"partial,\" citing the tech outage. A post on X says a \"partial\" activation is for incidents that require \"significant monitoring or resources,\" with additional emergency operations staffing from other agencies, functions and supporting organizations.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a popular cybersecurity software company created in 2012 by CEO George Kurtz, along with Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.\n\nAccording to its website, CrowdStrike has the \"world's most advanced cloud-native platform that protects and enables the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise.\"\n\nAlperovitch, CrowdStrike's former Chief Technology Officer, is a member of the Biden administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, which is meant to provide advice and expertise to support decision-making \"across the spectrum of homeland security operations.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat caused the CrowdStrike outage?\n\nAccording to an alert sent by CrowdStrike to its clients and reviewed by Reuters, the company's \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the \"Blue Screen of Death.\"\n\nKurtz said \"there was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts\" but customers “remain fully protected,” according to a post on X. He also reiterated that Friday's outage \"was not a security or cyber incident.\"\n\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said she spoke to Kurtz Friday and confirmed the incident did not appear to be related to a cyber attack.\n\n“At this point, we believe that it is an IT-related patch, an issue with that patch,” she said while speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. \"I think they're determining what went wrong there.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\n‘I’m just hoping to make it onto a flight’\n\nChance Ortego had reached the finish line of a nearly two-week work trip when he saw the news all air travelers dread: his flight was delayed.\n\nOrtego was in the AirTrain en route to his flight from San Francisco International Airport when he heard other travelers discussing the outage. After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment. An update posted to the company’s webpage Friday morning said the outage was impacting all its major products, including its enrollment feature.\n\n- Zachary Schermele\n\n911 call centers disrupted\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies across the country reported disruptions to 911 services after the outage hit.\n\nNational reports of 911 outages peaked at more than 100 on Friday just before 3 a.m. according to Downdetector.\n\nAgencies in at least seven states reported temporary outages, including the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office and Faribault Police Department in Minnesota, 911 systems New Hampshire, Fulton County, Indiana, and Middletown, Ohio.\n\nNon-emergency and 911 calls to multiple dispatch centers in Alaska \"were not able to be answered\" for around seven hours overnight, Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\n\"Dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or to partner dispatch centers that were not impacted to continue taking calls,\" he wrote. Systems in the state were back up as of 4:23 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department was also impacted ‒ 911 call centers could take calls, but had to dispatch officers manually, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in an email to USA TODAY that it was aware of reports of disruptions to 911.\n\n\"We’re closely working with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”\n\n- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden briefed on global outage as federal agencies assess impacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with the cybersecurity firm, as well as with impacted companies and agencies, according to the White House. Biden will receive \"sector-by-sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\" the White House added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is working to \"fully assess and address system outages.\"\n\nDHS added it's working alongside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as CrowdStrike, Microsoft and federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to get a grasp on the incident and its impacts.\n\nOver 2K US flights canceled amid outage\n\nSeveral U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA said operations were no longer impacted as of 10:53 a.m. ET, but it continues to monitor the situation and warned the global IT issue could continue to affect flights this weekend.\n\nThere were more than 2,500 U.S. flights canceled and more than 7,900 delays as of 3:25 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMost airlines were able to resume operations as the morning progressed, but many said they expected disruptions to continue throughout the day.\n\nRead more about the outage's travel impacts\n\nHospitals cancel nonemergency services\n\nHospitals across the U.S. and overseas were impacted by the outage, which forced some to cancel elective surgeries and halt visitations as well as outpatient services.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston canceled previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY.

For the latest updates on Hurricane Milton's aftermath across Florida, read USA TODAY's live hurricane coverage for Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Milton slammed into Florida's already storm-blasted west coast Wednesday evening as a Category 3 hurricane threatening huge swaths of Tampa Bay, Sarasota and regions still reeling from the destruction of Helene.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden referred to Hurricane Milton as “the storm of the century” and warned residents to heed evacuation orders. Tropical-storm-force winds, flooding rains, and tornadoes were spreading inland as the fierce hurricane made landfall near Siesta Key in Sarasota County.\n\nNumerous news outlets and Tampa residents also posted video of the roof of Tropicana Field being ripped to shreds by Milton's winds. The domed stadium is home to Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays and has recently been used as a base camp to support the Florida Department of Emergency Management ahead of the hurricane.\n\nMilton is forecast to maintain hurricane intensity as it crosses Florida overnight, the hurricane center said. By 5 a.m. ET Thursday, Milton’s winds weakened to 85 mph — making it a Category 1 storm — as it was 10 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAbout 125 homes had already been destroyed by Hurricane Milton by Wednesday evening, according to Florida officials. More than 3 million homes and businesses were in the dark by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said most of the lost residences were mobile homes in senior communities.\n\n\"We're trying to get to Florida's most vulnerable to make sure they're taken care of,\" he said. But Guthrie assured Florida residents, \"We are with you.\"\n\nThe latest hurricane strike comes on the heels of Helene, which left a trail of devastated communities across six states. Helene, which first hit Florida as a category 4 hurricane on Sept. 26, killed over 200 people and is estimated to have caused between $10.5 and $17.5 billion of insured losses alone.\n\nMilton brings fear of more widespread damage, with tropical storm-force winds extending out to 255 miles, according to the hurricane center. Millions of storm-weary Floridians had been ordered or urged to flee earlier in the day, particularly in the Tampa area, which was initially projected to be in the bulls-eye of the storm.\n\nTampa, with a metropolitan area that is home to over 3 million people, has not had a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than 100 years. Storm surge from Milton could drive water levels up to 12 feet above ground, the hurricane center said.\n\nMilton is the third hurricane to make landfall in Florida this year. That puts 2024 in a tie with five previous years for the most Florida landfalls in a single season, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. The other years were 1871, 1886, 1964, 2004 and 2005.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaking at a briefing earlier Wednesday, said the state is prepared. Hundreds of search and rescue personnel and 180 high-water vehicles have been embedded in likely storm impact sites, he said. Over 6,000 state National Guard members and 3,000 more from other states are at the ready, along with 50,000 linemen who will work on restoring power after the storm.\n\nHurricane Milton tracker:Follow the latest path of the storm\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Flash flood emergencies remained in effect early Thursday for parts of west-central Florida, according to the hurricane center. The National Weather Service reported that shortly after 1:30 a.m. ET, between 5 and 9 inches of rain had already fallen, and additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were possible in the warned area.\n\n∎ In St. Petersburg, Florida, authorities are responding to a water main break that will \"impact potable water services across the entire city,\" officials said in a statement. The city shut off all potable water service at midnight and officials warned that the temporary shutdown is expected to last \"until the necessary repairs can be completed.\"\n\n∎ High winds and extreme rainfall rates were expected along and to the north of Interstate 4, the weather service said. A gauge in St. Petersburg, Florida, recorded 5.09 inches of rain in an hour on Wednesday night. In total over 22 hours, a gauge at St. Petersburg's Albert Whitted Airport reported 18.31 inches of rain. Along the Northeast Florida coast, a peak storm surge of 3 to 5 feet is forecast.\n\n∎ Tornadic supercells − dangerous, rotating thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes − were beginning to sweep across the Florida peninsula, hurricane officials said. The weather service office in Melbourne received reports Wednesday from Okeechobee, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties \"that suggest multiple tornadoes touched down,\" said William Ulrich, warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service office in Melbourne.\n\nWinds cause damages in Tampa Bay area as power outages mount\n\nIn downtown Tampa, fierce winds tore down traffic lights, ripped signs off the ground, and sent construction barricades scudding across the wet pavement. Milton’s winds also ripped off plywood meant to keep the storm out, and a portion of a downtown building’s brick facade collapsed, partially blocking the road.\n\nOver 430,000 homes and businesses were without power in Hillsborough County by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data. Power outages began to impact services in the area.\n\nThe Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said on X, formerly Twitter, that its non-emergency line is currently down due to a power outage. The office advised residents to call 911 for \"any emergency\" as authorities work to get the line back up and running.\n\nTampa Bay Water asked residents in the area to \"limit water use immediately\" as its regional water supply system and some facilities are experiencing power outages.\n\n\"The regional supplier continues to run critical facilities on generator power but is asking residents to begin conserving water immediately to help maintain water supply to Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, and cities of New Port Richey and St. Petersburg,\" the water utility company said in a statement. \"Work to restore power may not occur until impacts from Hurricane Milton subside.\"\n\nMLB stadium damaged; crane collapsed at construction site\n\nAfter making landfall Wednesday night, Milton battered the Tampa Bay area with high winds and heavy rains. St. Petersburg officials confirmed shortly before midnight that destructive winds damaged the roof at Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nFootage from local television stations and photos shared on social media showed part of the stadium’s roof torn off amid high winds. A storm deployed weather sensor on the public beach at Anna Maria Island, near the mouth of Tampa Bay, reported 84-mph sustained winds, with a gust to 106 mph at 10 p.m, said Tyler Fleming, a meteorologist with the weather service in Tampa Bay.\n\nEarlier this week, DeSantis announced that the St. Petersburg stadium would serve as a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first responders. St. Petersburg Fire Rescue told ABC News that authorities were in contact with people inside the stadium and confirmed they were safe.\n\nOfficials also reported late Wednesday that a crane collapsed at a building construction site. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the crane collapsed into an office building that houses several businesses and left a hole in the building.\n\nThe building damaged by the crane had closed ahead of Milton’s landfall, according to the newspaper. By early Thursday, the crane remained on the ground, blocking the nearby street.\n\n“The public is urged to continue to shelter in place and avoid both areas until further notice,” the city of St. Petersburg said in a statement. “No injuries have been reported in either incident at this time.”\n\nEarlier, the city shared a video showing winds uprooting a tree at a local hotel.\n\nFeeding America CEO: Taylor Swift donated $5M to relief efforts\n\nTaylor Swift has donated $5 million to hurricane relief efforts for victims of Helene and Milton, the non-profit organization Feeding America announced Wednesday.\n\n\"We’re incredibly grateful to Taylor Swift for her generous $5 million donation to Hurricanes Helene and Milton relief efforts,” Feeding America's CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot wrote in an Instagram post. “This contribution will help communities rebuild and recover, providing essential food, clean water, and supplies to people affected by these devastating storms.\"\n\nFeeding America, a U.S.-based organization dedicated to helping to end hunger, works with local food banks, food pantries, and food programs.\n\n— C. A. Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nPresident Biden: 'It's a matter of life and death'\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were among the administration officials urging Florida residents Wednesday to follow safety instructions as Milton bore down on the state.\n\n“It’s a matter, literally, of life and death,” Biden said at a White House emergency briefing, referring to the hurricane as “the storm of the century.”\n\nBiden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and sent search and rescue teams as well as emergency food, water, power generators and ambulances to the region. In an evening briefing, the president said the Defense Department has also positioned helicopters and high-water rescue vehicles as close to the storm as possible to be ready to conduct life-saving missions.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged residents in the storm's wake to take precautions. “This is a storm that by every measure, understand, it's going to be more dangerous, more deadly and more catastrophic,” she said.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who located to Florida's capital, Tallahassee, for Milton’s landfall, said there are more than 1,000 federal personnel in Florida addressing the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and other recent storms. She has directed an additional 1,200 search-and-rescue workers to the state to respond to Milton.\n\n\"Floridians, they're no strangers to these storms,\" Criswell said. \"But this one, Hurricane Milton, it is expected to be catastrophic. And I promise you that FEMA is ready.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nReverse storm surge in Tampa Bay\n\nAs Milton approached, the water began rushing out of Tampa Bay in a phenomenon known as reverse storm surge. The phenomenon happens when powerful winds in a landfalling hurricane blow from the land over a bay or waterway and push the water out. South of Tampa along the coast, storm surge was flooding into communities, with increases in water levels exceeding 4-8 feet in some locations. Officials along the Southwest Florida coast warned the storm surge could continue rising into the early morning hours.\n\nMeteorologist Tyler Fleming confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday night a reverse surge is happening in Tampa Bay. He said water levels for the bay are below normal tide, but urged people to remain indoors until officials give the all-clear.\n\n\"It can cause infrastructure problems and people tend to walk out, which is incredibly dangerous with the water coming back in,\" he said.\n\nNearly 100 tornado warnings from Milton\n\nEven before making landfall, Milton brought a punch for many Floridians as its outer bands prompted 98 tornado warnings from the Tampa Bay, Melbourne and Miami offices of the National Weather Service, the agency said Wednesday.\n\nNWS-Miami meteorologist Will Redman said a preliminary report found at least nine tornadoes were confirmed in Miami, where the office had received 23 reports for South Florida as of 7 p.m. ET. The reports came from trained spotters and residents either seeing a tornado touch down or damage from a possible tornado, according to Redman, who said the worst of Milton has passed for that area.\n\n\"We were never expected to get too much rain from the hurricane,\" Redman said. \"We're just expected to get tropical storm-force winds from the storm with the outer bands.\"\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\n'Wall of black': Tornadoes cause widespread damage\n\nReported tornadoes tore through parts of southwest Florida on Wednesday, including in Collier County and Lee County, causing extensive damage across Fort Myers and Cape Coral.\n\nNorth Fort Myers resident Scott Fincher was sitting on the lanai of his Pine Lakes community home with his family, waiting for Milton. As they waited, they passed the time watching the local news, which was reporting on the \"tornado outbreak.”\n\nReporters then announced a tornado was headed into sister community Lake Fairways, which shares a boundary with Pine Lakes. That’s when Fincher knew: they had to hide.\n\nFincher immediately began moving everyone into the home: his wife, his sister-in-law and his dog. “Just as we were moving everybody in, that’s when it came through,” Fincher said, “and when I heard the rumbling.”\n\n“It was a wall of black,” Fincher said. “It was just as black as could be . . . I felt fear. You could feel the ground shaking a little bit, the house and everything.”\n\n— Kate Cimini, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nDamage, fatalities reported in Southeast Florida\n\nSuspected tornadoes damaged “dozens” of homes along the Treasure Coast in southeast Florida, according to authorities. The storm caused trees and live wires to fall, and neighborhoods were impassable in Martin County.\n\nIt's \"absolutely atrocious,\" said Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. \"It's a mess.\"\n\nSt. Lucie County officials confirmed to local television stations that there were multiple fatalities after tornadoes tore through the area. County Sheriff Keith Pearson told WPBF-TV the fatalities were reported in Spanish Lakes Country Club Village in Lakewood Park, a neighborhood in St. Lucie County north of Fort Pierce.\n\n\"We are going through the rubble,\" Pearson said. \" ... It's devastating. There are no words to describe it.\"\n\nOne of Port St. Lucie's emergency management officials was personally affected by the storm's destruction when a suspected tornado took out his home in northwest Fort Pierce. Billy Weinshank, Port St. Lucie's emergency operations division director, was at work when the storm struck his home, where seven people and \"a couple\" of pets were staying, said Sarah Prohaska, the city's communications director.\n\n\"His house is pretty much destroyed,\" Prohaska said, but noted that all of the people and pets were evacuated safely.\n\n— Treasure Coast Newspapers staff\n\nFor various reasons, several opt to ride out hurricane\n\nIt happens every time a hurricane approaches, no matter how dangerous or how much officials plead for residents to evacuate: Some invariably defy those orders and decide to ride it out.\n\nWhile millions of Floridians poured onto highways to get away from Milton on Tuesday and Wednesday, many opted to hunker down in vulnerable areas. Some residents said their house was elevated and would avoid the storm surge. Others said they feared running out of gas on traffic-jammed highways. Some said they wanted to leave but lacked the means to do so.\n\nLloyd Martinez and two of his friends are among the few staying in the coastal community of Everglades City, about 80 miles south of Fort Myers in the threatened west side of the Florida peninsula, figuring their lodging on the second floor of a riverside seafood restaurant will be safe.\n\n“We’re gonna be fine,” Martinez said.\n\n− Christopher Cann, Chris Kenning and Trevor Hughes\n\nFlorida removed tons of Helene debris before Milton's arrival\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday the state cleared out more than 3,000 truckloads of debris left behind by Helene ahead of Milton's arrival, in an effort to minimize the number of objects that could become projectiles amid high winds.\n\nLandfills have been operating 24 hours a day and a couple of extra ones were opened as the state encouraged residents to also pick up debris and dump it, DeSantis said.\n\nTropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays, has been converted into a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first-responders, but officials said storm-debris collection would stop Wednesday afternoon as Milton approached.\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nHomeless man with criminal record has few options\n\nAs the storm worsened Wednesday afternoon, Nolan Salter sought shelter beneath a building awning in downtown Tampa. Salter, who is unhoused, said he was hoping a friend who recently left town will return soon with a job opportunity for him.He hopes to survive until then.Court records show Salter, 32, got divorced in 2021 and was arrested for drug possession in 2023. Because of his criminal record, many traditional shelters are off-limits for him, and he said he didn’t feel comfortable hiding from the storm in a parking garageSalter said the downtown Tampa bus terminal has some large concrete pillars he felt he could shelter behind if the wind got higher. He said he hoped his heavy jacket, waterproof leather boots and multiple layers of socks and shirts would protect him.Munching on Doritos, Salter said he has more food but worried about access to drinking water. “It’s going to get really bad,” he said as he balanced his belongings in a garbage bag atop a bike with a flat rear tire. Finishing the small bag of chips, he zipped up his jacket and headed into the storm.\n\nBiden denounces Trump's 'onslaught of lies'\n\nBiden said he has spoken with DeSantis and other local and state leaders about Milton and gave them his personal cellphone number to contact him directly if necessary.\n\nThe president also called out former President Donald Trump for leading an “onslaught of lies” on FEMA’s recovery efforts regarding Helene.\n\nBiden said these include baseless claims that property is being confiscated, flood victims are limited to $750 in federal relief aid and FEMA is diverting hurricane relief funds to shelter migrants. Trump has pushed each false claim.\n\n“Now the claims are getting even more bizarre,'' Biden said. \"Marjorie Taylor Greene − a congresswoman from Georgia − is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather. It's beyond ridiculous. It's got to stop.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\n'It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk'\n\nAlex Ortiz was on the road for hours, trying to get her mother, her three dogs, eight cats and herself as far away as possible from Milton. They ended up in Destin, 370 miles north of their Pasco County home in Florida. She’d already seen the havoc wrought by Helene, and it cost her: She lost her Toyota Rav4 and a lot of her belongings stored in a ground-level garage.\n\n“I’m exhausted,” said Ortiz, 25. She and her mother had originally planned to stay at a motel in Tallahassee, but didn’t feel safe when they arrived there. They were running out of options. Her mother is partially disabled because of arthritis and most hotels and shelters either don’t take animals or limit their number.\n\n“What am I going to do? Throw some of them out of the car?” Ortiz said. She already had a friend take in her rabbit, but two of her dogs are seniors and prone to seizures. She loves her pets so much, she packed the urns of ones that had died previously into a rented Plymouth Voyager van.\n\n“It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk because you put yours at risk,” the lifelong Florida resident said. “Some people here think nothing bad can happen to them, like this is nothing. It’s nothing until it’s something.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nRiding out Milton in home turned refuge\n\nKatie Combs’ living room is full of damp family photos and birth certificates salvaged from her mother’s home after it was wrecked by Hurricane Helene. The storm – which left Combs’ home untouched – inundated and completely emptied her mother’s house in Indian Rocks Beach.\n\n“We found two dining chairs just floating in the ocean … a random tennis shoe hundreds of yards away,” Katie Combs said.\n\nNow, as Hurricane Milton approaches, Combs and her family nailed up boards and brought in furniture at her house in Pinellas Park – which has become a refuge for loved ones whose homes were destroyed by Helene. Recently affixed with a new roof, the house sits 20 feet above sea level and is several miles from the coast, in a city just north of St. Petersburg. She and her family stayed there during Helene and did not lose power.\n\n“If we had to, we could just get in the car and just drive and sleep in the car with the cat,” she said. “But now that we're here and my mom is staying with a friend about 25 minutes away, I don't think getting her and leaving is an option.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nMilton too dangerous for boat owners to stay\n\nAt the Davis Island Yacht Club in Tampa, Commodore Robert Tintera and fellow sailboat racer Emily Wagner spent Wednesday morning fighting increasingly gusty wind and rain to install a remote camera to monitor dozens of members’ boats moored along the docks. A skeleton crew of club members remained at the facility during Helene to loosen and tighten lines as necessary. But they’ve decided it’s just too dangerous to stay for Milton.Tintera's nearby home was significantly damaged by the surge from Hurricane Helene.“The thing I was worried the most about was my sailboat, and it was my house, two motorcycles and a car that got flooded,” said Tintera, who planned to evacuate Wednesday afternoon. “Our hope is that the weak side of the storm pushes the water out of the bay.\"\n\nMetalworker will ride out Milton with 10-foot metal bunny\n\nIn Tampa, while many other people made last-minute preparations, metalworker Dominique Martinez took another tack, driving around in his white pickup with a 10-foot-tall, purple metal bunny in the back. Martinez planned to ride out Milton in his studio home, which is inside an old city firehouse on high ground in Tampa. Because he wasn’t worried about his safety, he said, he could take the time to drive around his sculpture with the aim of bringing some levity to the situation.“So many people come up and are like, ‘this is so cool,’” he told USA TODAY as the wind intensified. “The proof is in the pudding. Look at your smile!”\n\nMapping fuel shortages:Gas shortages grow in Florida ahead of Milton\n\nFlorida's east coast also will face Milton's wrath\n\nMilton is zeroing in on Florida's west coast, but across the panhandle the east coast won't emerge unscathed. The National Weather Service in Melbourne said the storm is likely to have Category 1 hurricane strength when it rolls over the area. The service warned Wednesday that Milton is “likely to result in a rare and historic event for parts of the area” and the region’s residents could face “devastating impacts from hurricane winds and gusts,” including major flooding.\n\nStorm shelters throughout Brevard County, home to Melbourne, opened Wednesday morning ahead of Milton’s arrival on the Space Coast.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver and Michelle Spitzer, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMarco Island resident will ride out the storm\n\nMARCO ISLAND, Fla − On Wednesday morning in Marco Island, 180 miles south of Tampa, increasing winds began whipping palm trees Wednesday. Cars pulled into the city’s last open gas station, its windows covered with plywood and its owner manning the till because his workers didn’t feel safe to coming to work.\n\nOutside, Tim McCoy, 72, filled a supply of gas canisters. McCoy, who owns the island’s Sandbar restaurant that was full of revelers the night before, said he’d been through nearly 20 years of hurricanes including Hurricane Ian in 2022, when the island lost power and an 8-foot storm surge flooded hundreds of buildings and vehicles.\n\nHe was planning to stay for Milton because his home is on elevated ground. He was most worried about losing electricity.\n\n“We don’t have to worry about the flood, we just have to worry about power,” McCoy said, adding that \"if it was a direct hit, I’d probably be out of here.”\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nMilton forces cancellation of thousands of flights\n\nSeveral Central Florida airports have closed. More than 1,700 U.S. flights have been canceled for Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. The same goes for Thursday.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines had added seats and extra flights Monday and Tuesday to help people evacuate the area. Now those airlines along with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have issued waivers that allow travelers going to or from some Florida airports to change their tickets for no extra charge. Customers can check their airline’s website for specific details on travel advisories.\n\nIf a flight gets canceled for any reason, customers are entitled to a refund, according to Department of Transportation rules.\n\n− Eve Chen, Zach Wichter, Nathan Diller and Kathleen Wong\n\nHurricane Milton travel impact:What to know about flights, cruises, hotels and theme parks across Florida\n\nMost people have left this retirement town\n\nMuch of the coastal retirement community of Venice is under an evacuation order, including some areas hosting emergency shelters. Mayor Nick Pachota said officials believe those shelters will be safe enough for people to ride out the storm in, but that most people have left already.\n\nHelene hit Venice’s coastal areas hardest with storm surge, but Milton is expected to bring high winds and rain, along with a storm surge twice that of Helene. Venice, with a population of about 27,000, is about 70 miles south of Tampa.He said a significant concern are the piles of debris left by Helen, which are expected to be thrown around by Milton’s wind.Because so many elderly people retire there − the city’s median age is 68 years old, compared to 38 for the U.S as a whole − officials worked closely with their state counterparts to evacuate nursing home residents and others who could not move themselves.“We made a very big push to get everybody out of here and most of our facilities heeded that request,” Pachota said.\n\nWatch Hurricane Milton live cameras:Storm approaching Florida\n\nIs there a hurricane after Milton?\n\nWith more than seven weeks left in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, there's a good chance that catastrophic Hurricane Milton won't be the last storm to impact the U.S. this year.\n\nIn fact, forecasters are continuing to watch several other systems across the Atlantic basin, including one east of Florida that could become Tropical Storm Nadine later Wednesday.\n\nIf the system becomes Nadine, it would be the 14th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. A typical season – which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30 – has 14 storms. Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nMilton's size could mean more than wind speed\n\nMilton may wobble between a Category 3 and Cat 5 hurricane, but forecasters say that ranking doesn't capture the storm's true potential. The scale that ranks hurricanes – officially known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale – is a rating based on maximum sustained wind speed, which ranges from 74 to 157 mph, or higher. The scale does not take into account potentially deadly hurricane hazards such as storm surge, rainfall, river flooding and tornadoes.\n\nIn Milton's case, experts are focusing their concerns on the storm's growing size and potential for massive storm surge along populated areas − two of the things that don't factor into category rankings. The situation was slightly different with recent Hurricane Helene, where the storm's winds were a bigger concern as it made landfall in a less populated area with lots of trees and vulnerable structures.\n\nMilton winds peaked Monday evening as one of the top 5 strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with sustained winds of 180 mph. Though the winds have eased modestly, the storm has grown in size.\n\n\"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,\" the National Hurricane Center warned.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nFEMA warns: 'Avoid spreading false information'\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the agency is \"prepared to respond and stands ready to support\" Florida with resources requests.\n\n\"Hundreds of FEMA staff are on the ground in Florida supporting Helene recovery and coordinating with the state to prepare people for the next storm,\" the agency said in a news release.\n\nWhat category is Hurricane Milton?Florida has bigger worries than that.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushed back against Trump’s claims about Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, saying she was disappointed in the misinformation he was spreading. FEMA was forced to address misinformation on its webpage and social media platforms after Trump spread claims about hurricane relief efforts, including allegations that there are “no helicopters, no rescue” in North Carolina and that the federal government is only giving $750 to those who have lost their homes.\n\n— Saman Shafiq\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2020/03/10/travel-industry-reeling-coronavirus-concerns-anxiety/5000655002/", "title": "'They're getting pummeled': Travel industry reeling from coronavirus ...", "text": "A government warning not to board a cruise ship or long flight if you're frail.

The ripple effects from that trifecta are hurting airlines, hotels, car rental companies, cruise lines, tourist attractions and other travel businesses.\n\n\"We don’t know how this thing is going to play out yet,\" Shih said.\n\nCruises:Grand Princess passengers express concerns over coronavirus, lawsuit filed\n\nSigns of a slowdown\n\nU.S. airlines began suspending and cutting international flights in late January and have repeatedly added new reductions to additional destinations.\n\nNow the cuts are poised to spread to flights within the United States as travelers worry about the risks of flying anywhere, not just abroad.\n\nUnited Airlines last week said it will cut its domestic seat capacity by 10% in April and May and JetBlue said it is making 5% cuts.\n\nOn Tuesday, American said it is reducing international seat capacity by 10% this summer, including a 55% reduction in flights across the Pacific. Flights within the United States will be reduced by 7.5% for the month of April.\n\nThe number of reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. is small relative to other countries, but rapidly on the rise, spooking would-be travelers as they think about spring break and summer travel plans.\n\n\"People are going to modify their travel plans,\" said Paul Lewis, vice president of policy and finance at the Eno Center for Transportation, a policy group in Washington. \"We’re already seeing that.\"\n\nSouthwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly last week said the airline's bookings took a dive at the end of February. More than 95% of Southwest's flights are within the United States, making it a key barometer of the U.S. travel demand. The estimated financial hit: $200 million to $300 million in bookings.\n\n\"It has a 9/11 like feel,'' Kelly said of the drop in bookings.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association, which represents global airlines, last week boosted its estimates of the global financial hit from COVID-19 from $29.3 billion to between $63 billion and $113 billion as the bookings falloff has spread beyond Asia.\n\nThat would put airlines in their most precarious position since after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In the U.S. alone, the travel industry lost $40 billion from 2001 to 2005.\n\nAir traffic didn't return to pre-9/11 levels until July 2004, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the industry wasn't profitable again until 2006.\n\nTaking capacity out can help airlines stem the coming losses, Shih said. Still, they have high fixed costs.\n\n\"They have to pay for it whether it gets used or not,\" he said. \"That’s a huge problem.\"\n\nDiscounts might attract some skittish travelers, but Zandi thinks a broader recovery is further out.\n\n“9/11 really darkened travel and tourism for months, but not for an entire year,’’ he said. “I think it’s going to take a while for people to feel comfortable about traveling.\"\n\nAt the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump said he wanted to work with the airline and cruise industries to help them weather the coronavirus fallout.\n\n\"We'll be helping them through this patch,\" Trump said at a meeting with health insurance executives.\n\nAirlines:American, Delta cutting global and domestic flights as demand sinks\n\nThere's no place like home\n\nHotels get business form three sources – vacationers, business travelers and convention/eventgoers – and each group is pulling back on travel due to coronavirus concerns, said Jan Freitag, senior vice president of lodging insights for hotel research company STR.\n\nThe first solid look on U.S. hotel demand since the cases in the U.S. have escalated will be released Wednesday when STR reports data from the first week of March, but the fallout has already started to show in airport-area hotel occupancy, Freitag said.\n\nHotels near airports with a large number of international flights saw room demand fall in late February, he said. Demand at hotels near Newark International Airport in New Jersey was down 12%, and demand at Chicago O'Hare International airport hotels was off 8.1%.\n\nFreitag and Zandi said some destinations could end up benefiting if skittish travelers stay closer to home.\n\n\"You may want to go to the Jersey Shore if you're not going to get on a plane to go to Florida, the Caribbean or the south of France,'' Zandi said.\n\nOn lockdown:Italy expands travel restrictions to entire country to contain coronavirus\n\nOne impact of coronavirus fears could also prove to be a windfall to consumers: falling oil prices.\n\nWith benchmark crude prices hovering around $30 a barrel, less than half their year-to-date high of $63, Lewis said that could make driving more affordable.\n\n\"We could be seeing gas prices well below $2, maybe $1.50 in some places,\" he said.\n\nWith that in mind, people might decide taking a cruise or a tour of Europe isn't worth the risk that they could be quarantined somewhere far from home.\n\n\"Maybe people will consider vacationing closer to home,\" he said.\n\nCruise ships in limbo\n\nIt's been a rough period for cruise ship operators. Two Princess Cruises ships were hit with outbreaks, and other vessels were turned away from different ports because of fear coronavirus might be aboard.\n\nOver the weekend, Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC that older people and those with certain chronic health conditions should avoid taking cruises. The U.S. State Department issued an advisory warning older Americans not to travel on cruise ships.\n\nThe cruise ship industry responded with terse uniformity, with operators and industry associations using nearly identical language to emphasize immediate actions to upgrade medical protections aboard ships.\n\n“Our guests should make individual decisions knowing that we continue to implement higher and more rigorous protocols to protect their health and safety,\" Carnival Cruise Line spokesman Vance Gulliksen said via email. \"While advisories are in place, we are open for business.”\n\nHolland America Inc. used similar verbiage while stressing that cruise ship travel \"remains one of the best vacation values available.\"\n\nDespite such attempts to calm the crisis, the industry's bottom line will suffer immediate damage, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nChristopher Muller, a professor of practice at Boston University’s School of Hospitality, predicted losses “in the hundreds of millions of dollars… This is a terrible thing,” he added. “I don’t know how the industry recovers.”\n\nAndrew Coggins, a clinical professor of management at Pace University, said fear is a cruise company's chief enemy. \"It's probably more psychological, especially when the government comes out and says, 'Don't take cruises,'\" he added. \"The industry is pretty resilient. It's a question of how long this will last.\"\n\nCruise companies had a $52 billion impact on the U.S. economy in 2018, up 10% from 2016, the Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group, reported last year. Cruise ships carried 12.68 million U.S. passengers, supported more than 400,000 jobs and paid $23 billion in wages.\n\nNo single state has more at stake than Florida, where the cruise industry employs 150,000 workers, pays $7.69 billion in wages and generates $8.49 billion in direct spending.\n\nJaime M. Katz, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told USA TODAY that while coronavirus will impact the industry this year, it is likely that things will \"return closer to normal in 2021.\"\n\n\"I think the real disruption (to the industry) is that because the virus is globally pervasive, there isn’t an easy place to reposition ships to attract demand currently,\" Kat said.\n\nIn the conference call with reporters over the weekend, Jan Swartz, the president of Princess Cruises, said the industry was adjusting to \"a new normal.\"\n\n\"We intend to be flexible and adapt,\" she said.\n\nOlympics:Japanese organizing official discusses possibility Olympics could be postponed 1-2 years\n\nRoad to recovery\n\nLast month, more than 700 passengers from the Diamond Princess became infected after the ship was held in quarantine off the coast of Japan. Of roughly 300 Americans evacuated from the ship and returned to the United States, 46 tested positive. Though most have ended their 14-day quarantine at U.S. military bases, some have remained in medical isolation as they recover.\n\nTwo thousand more cruise passengers on the Grand Princess await their next steps. The ship berthed on Monday at the Port of Oakland, California, where the passengers will be tested, disembarked and quarantined in the coming days. At least two passengers and 19 crew members have tested positive.\n\nU.S. officials have stopped short of restricting cruises. Over the weekend, cruise companies met with Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and agreed to voluntary steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus on ships, including stricter preboarding passenger screenings, and increased use of social distancing and disinfecting.\n\nThe psychological impact for the industry, however, has been “cringe-worthy,” Muller said, especially news video this week of helicopters circling the Grand Princess cruise liner as she docked in Oakland with 3,500 passengers and crew under quarantine.\n\nWhile the government has no choice but to warn consumers, Muller added, “It’s a shame because I don’t think it’s the industry’s fault.”\n\nTanner Callais, the founder and editor of Cruzely.com, told USA TODAY that he thinks coronavirus is going to have an impact on the industry for several months, if not longer.\n\n\"At this point, if things were to calm down,you’re probably still looking at six months to a year where it’s impacting people’s buying decisions,\" he said. \"If things continue to get worse, I just see that timeline increasing a bit.\"\n\nHe added, \"(It's a) pretty big deal when the State Department comes out and says U.S. citizens should avoid cruise ships and I don't think that’s been taken lightly by most middle of the road consumers.\"\n\nAnd while the problem may clear up in the long run, Callais doesn't think the link between coronavirus and cruises will leave the public's memory anytime soon.\n\n\"The Carnival Triumph — that was 2013 — people still remember the 'poop cruise,' is what they call it,\" said Callais. \"I think it will be something that is always in the memory of people and there will always be jokes about it, mentions of it.\"\n\nTravelers who lined up to board the six cruise ships docked at Port Miami on Monday made their own preparations. They packed their bags with hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and Lysol spray cans, and said they’d be extra careful by washing their hands frequently and avoiding anyone who’s coughing.\n\nBut they said the spreading virus wouldn’t stop them. In fact, Chrisean Nichols said his main concern was getting quarantined upon his return.\n\nThe sophomore at the University of Pittsburgh was traveling with his family to celebrate his 20th birthday on Thursday, and he said they talked in recent weeks about canceling.\n\n“When we talked about concerns, it was less about whether or not we’d get coronavirus and more about whether we’d get quarantined,” he said. “That would be a kick in the pants.”\n\nContributing: Alan Gomez, Ryan Miller, Courtney Subramanian and Dennis Wagner, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/08/08/trump-immigrants-rhetoric-criticized-el-paso-dayton-shootings/1936742001/", "title": "Trump used words like invasion, killer to discuss immigrants 500 times", "text": "WASHINGTON – Invasion. Aliens. Killers. Criminals.\n\nThose are among the words President Donald Trump repeatedly uses while discussing immigduring his campaign rallies, according to a USA TODAY analysis of the transcripts from more than five dozen of those events.\n\nTrump, who traveled Wednesday to Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, to meet with victims and family members reeling from mass shootings, is facing pressure from critics who say his language has fed a climate of anger toward immigrants, raising the risk of violence. A manifesto authorities believe was written by the El Paso gunman before his attack decries “the Hispanic invasion of Texas.”\n\nBut \"invasion\" is just one of several incendiary terms Trump regularly embraces.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis of the 64 rallies Trump has held since 2017 found that, when discussing immigration, the president has said “invasion” at least 19 times. He has used the word “animal” 34 times and the word “killer” nearly three dozen times.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nThe exclusive USA TODAY analysis showed that together, Trump has used the words \"predator,\" \"invasion,\" \"alien,\" \"killer,\" \"criminal\" and \"animal\" at his rallies while discussing immigration more than 500 times. More than half of those utterances came in the two months prior to the 2018 midterm election, underscoring that Trump views immigration as a central issue for his core supporters.\n\nHe often turns to harsh rhetoric to describe gang members who are immigrants. But Trump just as often conflates the MS-13 gang, proliferating in South America and some U.S. communities, with the broader movement of immigrants across the border.\n\nInvasion ads:Trump campaign's Facebook ads lean on talk of migrant invasion\n\nGuns:Trump considers tougher background checks after shootings in El Paso, Dayton\n\nTrump has used “the hell out of our country” at least 43 times during his rallies. In virtually all of those cases, he was referring to immigrants in the country illegally.\n\n“This is an invasion,” Trump said in May during a rally in Panama City Beach, Florida. “I was badly criticized for using the word invasion. It's an invasion.”\n\nThose who study political rhetoric question Trump’s insistence that his rhetoric is not aimed at stirring up divisions. The word invasion, some analysts have said, conjures up the image of an incursion by a foreign enemy force.\n\n“Trump does nothing by accident,” said Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University who has studied propaganda.\n\n“The use of repetition – a propaganda mainstay – points to an intention by Trump to impose a way of thinking about his designated targets,” she said.\n\n'Deepest, darkest forces'\n\nSome Trump critics have pointed to an exchange between Trump and a member of the audience at the Florida rally in May who shouted “shoot them” when the president asked how to stop an influx of people crossing the border he described as a \"crisis.\"\n\n“That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement,” Trump joked.\n\nBut while that exchange drew significant attention from national media, it captured only a slice of the harsh rhetoric Trump regularly relies on during his rallies.\n\n“The words of a president matter,” former vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Wednesday in Iowa. “They can unleash the deepest, darkest forces in this nation. That is what Donald Trump has chosen to do.”\n\nTrump has rejected the idea that his words have inspired violence.\n\nTrump accused those raising the criticism of trying to score political points ahead of the 2020 election. He has pointed to other shooters, including the gunman in Dayton, who appear to have supported Democratic candidates.\n\n“I think my rhetoric ... brings people together,” Trump told reporters at the White House before departing on the daylong trip to Ohio and Texas. “I think we have toned it down. We’ve been getting hit left and right from everybody.”\n\nThe United States has a deep history with violence directed at ethnic and racial minorities that predates Trump. It's also true that other mass shooters have indicated support for Democrats. But the president's rhetoric is unusual in the intensity he brings to his attacks. Even Trump's supporters acknowledge he speaks differently than most politicians. For some, that’s part of his appeal.\n\nFor others, it's cause for concern.\n\nTrump was tweeting the term “invasion” to describe illegal immigration at least as far back as August 2015, when he appears to have quoted a supporter demanding that he \"stop the invasion.\" But Trump's use of the word came under added scrutiny after the gunman in the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last fall posted a gripe about \"invaders.\"\n\nStill, Trump continued to hammer away on Twitter and at his rallies with the word “invasion,\" or some variation of it. He used the word at least four times in two separate rallies on Nov. 4, two days ahead the 2018 midterm election. There is no indication the synagogue shooter, who was critical of Trump, was responding to Trump's rhetoric.\n\nTrump used the word again during a rally in Iowa in March, telling supporters the nation was \"on track for 1 million illegal aliens trying to rush our borders. It is an invasion.\"\n\nImmigrants v. MS-13\n\nTrump’s most vitriolic rhetoric – “killers” and “predators,” among other words – is virtually always reserved for members of the MS-13 gang. It is gang violence that many people arriving in the U.S. are seeking to escape by claiming asylum.\n\nBut as far back as his campaign, Trump has often conflated gangs with broader immigration. Some studies suggest immigrants in the country illegally are far less likely to commit crimes than citizens, in part because to do so risks capture and deportation.\n\nThat's a distinction Trump never raises, and it's a nuance that can be lost in sharp, easy-to-digest soundbites.\n\n“We have barbed wire going up because you know what? We're not letting these people invade our country,” Trump said during a rally in Macon, Georgia, in November.\n\n“ICE is tracking down gang members, drug dealers, predators and killers, and we're either throwing them in jail or throwing them the hell out of our country,” he said in Charleston, West Virginia, months before that.\n\nTrump launched his White House run in 2015 with a speech alleging that foreign countries were \"sending people that have lots of problems\" including, he said at the time, \"rapists.\" But Trump dropped the word from his rally stump speech before he became president. It has occasionally cropped up during official events on immigration, including in January.\n\nNearly three of four Democrats say some of the responsibility for recent violence lies with the president, according to a USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll this week. That compares with 23% of Republicans who feel that way.\n\nPoll:Who's to blame for mass shootings? On that, some bipartisan agreement\n\n'Dehumanizing rhetoric '\n\nSome experts say the president's language has created a charged atmosphere that can increase the possibility of violence.\n\n\"President Trump’s dehumanizing rhetoric about those seeking entry at the southern border creates a climate conducive to hostile action,\" said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBeyond the rally stage, Trump’s campaign has flooded social media with warnings that the U.S. is under “invasion” by immigrants coming across the southern border. That has taken place on Twitter, the president’s platform of choice, but also in a deluge of advertising on Facebook.\n\nFacebook political advertising data analyzed by USA TODAY shows that Trump’s campaign funded the publication of more than 2,000 political ads that urged users to, for instance, “STOP THE INVASION.”\n\nAnother word Trump has frequently used to describe immigrants is \"alien.\" He was nearly four times as likely to use that word when describing immigrants during his rallies than “immigrants,” according to the analysis. He almost never uses the word “migrant.”\n\n“Alien” is a word occasionally found in federal law or official documents, but it has not been uttered as frequently by Trump’s predecessors, if at all. A review of former President Barack Obama's remarks and statements archived at the American Presidency Project at the University of California Santa Barbara found no reference to the term. A similar review for President George W. Bush’s term found only a handful of references to the word.\n\n“Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport every illegal immigrant, and that any proposal short of this amounts to amnesty,” Bush said during an address to the nation on immigration in 2006, using language that was more representative of how he generally talked about immigrants.\n\n“It is neither wise, nor realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send them across the border,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/04/11/baltimore-bridge-collapse-ship-blackouts-incidents/73262682007/", "title": "How many ships hit bridges, lose power every year? Data shows ...", "text": "An alarm wails onboard the container ship as it approaches the Francis Scott Key Bridge during what had until that moment seemed like a routine departure from the Port of Baltimore.\n\nFor the past half hour, the crew navigated the hulking vessel through relatively calm waters and lined it up to pass perfectly under the main truss of the steel bridge, softly lit in the early morning darkness.\n\nNow, just a half mile from the span, the vessel has gone dark – no power, no steering, no propulsion. Inside the ship’s towering command center, the crew tries to re-engage the system but no luck. The nearly 100,000-ton ship is adrift.\n\n“Captain, we are on a collision course with the bridge support,” announces the officer of the watch, who recommends dropping its anchor. No change. A desperate call goes out to the shore to stop traffic from crossing the bridge.\n\nThe captain realizes the hard truth: The Dali is “at the point of extremis,” he says – the point of no return.\n\nThe crew watches helplessly as the bridge looms larger and larger until, just four minutes after the alarm sounded, their vessel slams into one of its main support columns.\n\n“At this point there is absolutely, certainly nothing that we could do on our own,” said Chief Mate Kevin Calnan from inside California State University Maritime Academy’s 360-degree mission simulator during an eerily vivid replication of the Baltimore bridge disaster.\n\nThe state-of-the-art simulator – one of just three of its kind nationwide – showed how a total loss of power on a container ship the size and weight of the Dali could turn it into an uncontrollable weapon of mass destruction – a transformation counted in precisely calculated currents and breezes, velocity and minutes, not hours.\n\nMoments after the Dali struck it, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed into Patapsco River, killing at least six construction workers, likely causing billions of dollars in damage and forever altering the Baltimore skyline.\n\nAlthough such disasters are rare, the conditions that could cause them are frighteningly common, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. Coast Guard maritime incident data, which includes any reportable maritime event involving a death or injury, collision, grounding, environmental harm, or the loss of power and propulsion.\n\nMap: Where ships have struck bridges, lost power\n\nThis map shows issues categorized as \"major\" or \"significant\" marine casualties and “serious marine incidents” in U.S. Coast Guard incident investigation reports that mention a freight ship, freight barge, tank ship, tank barge or ocean cruise vessel striking a bridge. It also includes cases where ships lost power, propulsion or steering within two kilometers of a highway bridge over navigable waters. Don't see a map? Click here.\n\nAt least 6,000 times in the past 22 years – an average of more than five times a week – crews on board massive cargo ships, oil tankers, container barges and even cruise vessels have reported what befell the Dali: a loss of power, loss of propulsion, loss of steering, or some combination of the three, a USA TODAY data analysis reveals.\n\nAt least 900 of them occurred near bridges identified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as spanning navigable waters. The vast majority were classified as routine but a dozen were labeled major or significant.\n\nSome damaged both the ships and the structures they hit. Others left crew members with broken bones or other injuries. But most, including cases remarkably similar to what happened last month in Baltimore, have never been made public, buried deep in a federal database.\n\nOften the dividing line between major and routine came down to a last-minute effort by the crew or rescue teams.\n\nThe Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge had an earlier close call, in 2018\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the bulk carrier Strategic Alliance lost power and propulsion on the Delaware River just north of the Commodore Barry Bridge, a 2.6-mile span connecting Philadelphia to New Jersey and carrying more than 41,000 vehicles a day.\n\nThe Singapore-flagged vessel, about half the size of the Dali, dropped anchor in the channel without incident early that Friday morning and was able to regain propulsion and generator power after clearing its clogged cooling water strainers of debris. Nearly two years later, the Dali-sized container ship Maersk Chicago lost power in New York’s Lower Bay Channel as it approached the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge late on a Wednesday night.\n\nRoughly 500 feet from the country’s longest suspension span – crossed by nearly a quarter-million vehicles a day – the ship was adrift with no steering, no propulsion and no engine. Fortunately, a pair of tugboats were able to rescue the U.S.-flagged vessel and tow it to safety, where it was determined a broken air compressor valve was to blame.\n\nJust last week, another container ship lost propulsion near the same bridge. The Liberia-flagged vessel, Qingdao, experienced the failure around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday as it navigated through the Kill Van Kull shipping lane between Staten Island and Bayonne, New Jersey.\n\nIt took three tugboats to bring the vessel under control.\n\nUnlike most incidents in the Coast Guard database, the Qingdao made the news as images of the gigantic ship floating near the bridge spooked jittery Americans still reeling from the recent Baltimore disaster.\n\nThat the two events happened in close succession was not so much a coincidence, but rather a fairly common occurrence that’s bound to happen when tens of thousands of ships from all over the world travel in and out of U.S. waters every year, several maritime experts told USA TODAY.\n\nStatistically, the experts said, such failures are more likely to happen in ports and harbors, as well as in close proximity to bridges, because that’s when the ships are under the most stress.\n\n“That’s when you’re giving all your engine orders,” said Calnan, the assistant professor of marine transportation who ran the simulation at Cal Maritime for USA TODAY. Calnan has operated large ships himself and has experienced what is sometimes known as a dark ship, though only while out at sea.\n\n“It’s just like in the car; if you’re going 65 on the highway, there’s not a lot happening,” he said, “But when you’re doing a lot of stop and go and changing engine orders, it’s putting stress on the engine, and if something is mechanically wrong with the engine itself, there’s a higher chance it will happen when you’re using it more.”\n\nMechanical failure, human error and a host of other conditions can conspire to shut down a vessel’s engine, seize up its propulsion system or thwart its crew’s ability to steer.\n\nSometimes a simple miscalculation can cause a crew to lose command of a ship – or cause an otherwise seaworthy ship to hit a bridge.\n\nUSA TODAY’s data analysis revealed at least 2,600 bridge strikes occurring in U.S. waters since 2002, the earliest year for which such data is available. Three of these allisions were fatal, claiming 16 lives in all. The majority, however, were minor – a ship’s antenna or mast hitting a bridge, or a barge clipping a bridge’s protective fender.\n\nBut maritime problems – which international governing agencies call “casualty incidents” – have been steadily rising over the past decade, according to a report by Lloyd’s List Intelligence, a global maritime data and analytics company.\n\nThat’s especially true for those caused by machinery damage or failure.\n\nThe Lloyd’s report cites 700 such reported events in the third quarter of 2022 – the highest in 14 years – and attributed the increase to several factors. Among them: fewer ship inspections and internal audits, an unavailability of dry docks and technicians to perform maintenance and repairs, as well as supply chain delays in getting spare parts.\n\nLloyd’s was unable to provide updated data, but a representative told USA TODAY incidents have continued to rise.\n\nThe crew could do little to avert catastrophe\n\nThe frequency of such malfunctions and the risks to life and property are at the heart of Cal Maritime’s simulation exercises, which train students how to react to the worst disasters in a controlled environment.\n\nIn the case of the Dali simulation, the unfortunate lesson was that there was little they could do to avoid a catastrophe once the power was down except alert others to their plight.\n\n“Making that emergency call and alerting all of the other traffic in the area that, ‘Hey, we’re this ship and we can’t maneuver anymore, we’re not under command’ – that call itself is what we see in this accident in Baltimore,” Calnan said. “That singular call… saved countless lives.”\n\nWhile most power outages cause minimal harm, the one that darkened the Dali occurred at a most unfortunate place and time: about 0.6 nautical miles from the Francis Scott Key Bridge while the laden ship was moving at a speed of roughly 8 knots and the wind was blowing from the northeast, according to real-time data fed into the simulator.\n\nWhen the blackout occurred, the ship’s rudder was turned 3 degrees to the starboard side and remained stuck there as the vessel drifted off course. Its towering stack of containers acted as a sail for the wind, which aimed it directly at the bridge’s support column.\n\nEven if the engine had been working, Calnan said, it would have taken 0.8 nautical miles to bring that particular vessel under those particular conditions to a full stop – farther than the distance to the bridge it was about to hit. Simply put, time had run out.\n\n“During any situation on board any type of vessel, we have a concept which we call the point of extremis, which essentially means there’s a point in every situation where no matter what you do, it's going to lead to some form of undesirable outcome,” he said. “Basically, it’s the point of no return.”\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board and U.S. Coast Guard investigators are still working to determine the cause of the blackout on the Dali. They have retrieved documents and interviewed the crew, as well as others who witnessed or were involved in the crash. But it could be months before they release their findings.\n\nIn the meantime, maritime experts have offered a number of possible causes based on their own experience with engine failure.\n\n“There are 101 potential reasons for a blackout,” said Capt. Ashok Pandey, a master mariner and associate professor of international maritime business at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.\n\nThey include inexperienced crew members accidentally switching off a valve that shuts down the fuel supply, water forming inside poorly maintained fuel tanks and knocking out the engine, and countless situations involving dirty fuel gumming up the ship’s filters, pumps and injectors.\n\nDeep-sea vessels like the Dali burn what’s known as heavy fuel oil – sometimes called bunker fuel – a cheap, tar-like residue that the crew processes onboard the ship by heating, filtering and purifying it before feeding it into the combustion system.\n\nSometimes the heavy fuel itself is particularly bad and can clog the ship’s strainers. Other times the crew fails to properly maintain its onboard processing system and dirty fuel gets into the engine. Either way, it can lead to disaster.\n\n“We have all been through bad fuel situations – you get bad fuel and it clogs the strainers, and every engineer has had to go down and clean the strainers,” said Keith Deirup, a licensed chief engineer with 20 years of experience in the U.S. merchant marine industry. “If you lose an engine, it's a total loss of propulsion, and it takes a while to get it back online.”\n\nAccidents, dirty fuel and fish cause blackouts\n\nCoast Guard incident reports blame a host of culprits for the power outages reported by hundreds of ships over the years. They include unpredictable events like lightning strikes, fires on board or even fish clogging water inlets meant to help cool the engines.\n\nSeveral incident reports attribute power losses to dirty – or degraded – fuel, as was the case in June 2017, when the Hong Kong-flagged Mallika Naree went dark on the Elizabeth River outside Norfolk, Virginia. The bulk carrier dragged a buoy nearly 400 yards before running aground. The investigation revealed about 16 gallons of water had leaked into the fuel oil supply tank.\n\nDelayed maintenance also shows up as a common cause of power outages. “Poor maintenance” on a fuel oil valve led to a power outage that ran the 681-foot-long Alexander Dimitrov aground east of New Orleans in January 2002. The report states “the valves should have been checked as part of routine maintenance.”\n\n“Lack of inspection, testing replacement/maintenance of the time delay relays” was to blame in February 2019, when the captain of the Portuguese container ship EMS Trader ordered an emergency lowering of the anchor. The ship had lost power, steering and propulsion not far from the Commodore Barry Bridge southwest of Philadelphia.\n\nMany of the incident reports blame human error and inattention.\n\nThe 1,096-foot-long container ship Ever Lotus lost power while mooring at the Port of Los Angeles in November 2016. Even though the vessel’s crew was trained to slowly increase the pitch of the bow thruster so as to not overload the generators, “the pilot adjusted the pitch from 0% to 100% instantly,” according to the incident report.\n\nThree years earlier, the 604-foot-long Manistee went dark as it was backing out of Ashtabula Harbor east of Cleveland. The engineer on watch forgot to throw a switch that would prevent the generators from overheating, leading to the outage.\n\nSuch incidents reinforce the need for extra precaution when ships navigate near critical infrastructure, said Pandey of Massachusetts Maritime, who advocated for mandatory tug escorts regardless of the ship, its cargo or the port.\n\nProtecting bridges:Baltimore's Key Bridge, opened in 1977, had few ship defenses. Are modern bridges better?\n\n“Increasingly, the use of tugs is considered too old-fashioned, maybe too expensive, simply because we have the technology,” he said. “It’s something we don’t talk enough about.”\n\nOther experts said nothing can prevent every disaster, and the Dali might be a case in point.\n\n“Naval engineers will look at the root causes and ask what we can do to prevent it from happening again,” said a senior government official and former Coast Guard officer who spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\n\"And maybe there isn’t anything we can do,” he said. ”Maybe fate just caught up with it.”\n\nMore than half of major bridge collapses are in the U.S.\n\nDespite the frequency of power failures and bridge strikes reported to the Coast Guard, the maritime shipping industry has had relatively few major accidents like the one that toppled the Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n\nUntil this March, the last incident identified by USA TODAY in which a ship knocked down a U.S. bridge was on Jan. 26, 2012, when the Delta Mariner cargo vessel carrying rocket components down the Tennessee River from Alabama to Florida slammed into the Eggner’s Ferry Bridge near Aurora, Kentucky.\n\nThe ship, going about 10 knots, tore away a 322-foot span of the bridge as it attempted to pass under a section with insufficient clearance.\n\nFortunately, traffic was light and vehicles stopped before reaching the missing portion of the bridge, according to an National Transportation Safety Board report of the crash. There were no deaths or injuries, but the bridge sustained major damage. It was repaired and reopened later that year but permanently closed in 2016 after a new bridge was built in its place.\n\nThree years earlier, in March 2009, a tugboat pushing eight barges on the Mississippi River knocked out the Popps Ferry Bridge in Biloxi, Mississippi, when it crashed into one of its pilings and sent a section of the span tumbling into the water. Again, nobody died.\n\nOther ship-on-bridge allisions killed people but did not topple the span. This includes the July 2015 death of a construction worker on the Eads Bridge in St. Louis when a tugboat pushing two loaded barges struck his scaffolding as it was passing under the span. And the August 2014 death of a tugboat master when his crane barge hit the Florida Avenue lift bridge in New Orleans and the crane’s mast fell onto the wheelhouse, crushing him.\n\nThe last U.S. ship-on-bridge allision to cause both fatalities and bring down the bridge, according to USA TODAY’s review of the data, happened more than two decades ago.\n\nOn May 26, 2002, the towboat Robert Y. Love was pushing two empty asphalt tank barges on the Arkansas River when it veered off course and struck a pier supporting the Interstate 40 highway bridge near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma.\n\nThe impact sent a 503-foot section of the bridge tumbling into the river. Unlike the Kentucky bridge collapse, highway traffic on the I-40 span had continued to “drive into the void,” according to the NTSB report.\n\nFourteen people died and five were injured in the accident, which the report said caused an estimated $30.1 million in damage to the bridge and $276,000 to the barges.\n\nWorldwide, between 1960 and 2015 ships or barges caused 35 major bridge collapses that killed 342 people, according to a 2018 report from the World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure.More than half occurred in the United States.\n\nYet the United States has some of the strictest maritime standards in the world, according to the experts. Its rules and regulations – which include a host of technical, personnel and environmental practices – go far beyond those set by the International Maritime Organization, which governs all global shipping.\n\nThey ensure that U.S ships are built and maintained to the highest standards and that its crews follow industry best practices. These rules also apply, to a certain extent, to foreign-flagged ships in U.S. waters, even though those ships might operate under what some experts described as subpar conditions.\n\n“Many of the world’s shipping companies are based out of countries like Liberia, Marshall Islands and Panama” Deirup said. “They do that to save on costs and liability, so they get to run these ships really cheaply. They hire mariners from whatever country they can offer the cheapest wages and will run a really shoddy operation without much oversight.”\n\nMany of the ships, he said, “are just ramshackle.”\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has jurisdiction in U.S. waters and can detain a ship for safety issues, Deirup said, “but they’re spread really thin.”\n\nDetainments typically happen when a Coast Guard inspection finds significant issues with a ship, but it takes years to train the marine inspectors and there aren’t nearly enough of them in the field, said the former Coast Guard officer who was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nNot all ships are inspected, either, he said. The Coast Guard uses an algorithm based on the vessel’s history and previous ports of call and current port to determine which ships to check.\n\nExacerbating the situation are the extremely tight schedules ships’ crews face to unload outgoing cargo and pickup inbound cargo before racing to the next port. That’s especially true of container ships, experts said, whose slots at ports are scheduled weeks in advance and must make it on time or miss the window.\n\n“For this ship, the Dali, in Baltimore, they were probably under that pressure,” Deirup said. “That’s why if they had problems with their generators – just theorizing – but they might have been under a lot of pressure to just make it work and get off that dock.”\n\nThat type of pressure is difficult to mimic in a simulator, which is perhaps why the crew on the bridge of Cal Maritime’s digital ship operated with calm efficiency each time they ran through the scenario. Blackout, steering out, ship dead in the water, bridge looming, crash. Again and again and again.\n\nOnly one run involving tug boats averted the disaster, and even then only when two tugs at full power were tethered to the ship all the way under the bridge. That lineup is not a current day reality except in rare situations, such as tankers transporting oil or other toxins in certain ports.\n\nSolutions:Tugboats left before ship reached Baltimore bridge. They might have saved it.\n\n“No matter what nationality the crew was or what their training was like, I think in the end, it’s an unlucky situation at an unlucky point,” said Conor Finnerty, a Cal Maritime senior who assumed the role of officer of the watch during the simulation.\n\nOne of the most critical positions on the ship, the officer of the watch ensures the vessel navigates safely regardless of obstacles or conditions. During the simulation, Finnerty gave orders to the crew to continue testing the equipment, then to drop the anchor and, finally, to sound the danger signal warning anyone on the water that collision was imminent.\n\n“There’s really not much that could have been done about it,” Finnerty said of the unfolding disaster, “except just watch it.”\n\nUSA TODAY reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/08/06/live-updates-sarasota-struggles-with-tropical-storm-debby-aftermath/74683999007/", "title": "Live Updates: Sarasota County releases new map of road closures", "text": "Staff Report\n\nSarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nSupport local journalism with a digital subscription to the Herald-Tribune.\n\nThough Sarasota and Manatee counties were not in Tropical Storm Debby's direct path, the storm brought record rainfall that has left the area reeling.

For the latest news on the storm, view our live updates file for Monday, Sept. 30.\n\nASHEVILLE, N.C. − More than 2 million people remained without power late Sunday across the Southeast in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, including more than 430,000 in North Carolina, where the deadly storm pulverized homes, trapped residents, spawned landslides, and submerged communities under raging floodwaters.\n\nAt least 90 people have died across multiple states since the record-breaking storm hit Florida's Big Bend as a Category 4 hurricane with 140-mph winds Thursday, before moving north through Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas and weakening to a post-tropical cyclone. The death toll is expected to rise.\n\nOn Sunday, North Carolina officials were still trying to grasp the level of devastation. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said at a news conference that at least 11 people died in the devastated state, \"and tragically we know there will be more.\"\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said more than 1,000 people were reported missing through the county’s online portal but added that she expected the number to drop dramatically when cell service is restored. Rescue crews are “still trying to save every single person we can” in the hard-hit community, Pinder said.\n\nHundreds of roads were washed away, cellular service for over 250,000 people was cut off, and vast swaths of cities such as Asheville were left underwater. Cooper said Helene had become \"one of the worst storms in modern history for parts of North Carolina.\"\n\nOfficials said earlier that more than 200 people had been rescued in the state by water and helicopter crews.\n\nRyan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, said the wreckage was overwhelming. \"We have biblical devastation through the county. We’ve had biblical flooding here,” Cole said.\n\nDeaths in eastern Tennessee as communities remain underwater\n\nAt least two people in eastern Tennessee have died due to the recent devastation caused by Helene, officials said Sunday. One death was confirmed in Unicoi County and the other in Johnson County.\n\n\"We do expect this number to change,\" spokesperson Myron Hughes of the Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency said during a 5 p.m. news conference. Tennessee officials reported that 153 people were still unaccounted for in the state as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMany communities across eastern Tennessee were still underwater and coping with crumbled roads, unsteady bridges, and devastated utility systems. The remnants of Helene brought rivers to record levels and forced evacuations.\n\nLocal schools remained closed, including Carter County Schools which will likely be closed \"for an indefinite period of time due to the ongoing disruptions,\" count spokesperson Ivan Sanders said. In Elizabethton, Sycamore Shores Hospital had shut down but nearby hospitals were up and running, according to Sanders.\n\n— Areena Arora, Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nPower returning to many in North Carolina, but drivers hindering repair efforts\n\nCooper said the number of customers without power is down from more than 1 million to 464,000 on Sunday afternoon, and efforts are underway to restore cellphone service to the thousands without it.\n\nAttempts to provide relief and make repairs are hindered by residents driving in areas impacted by the storm, state officials said at an afternoon news conference, urging people to stay home.\n\n\"Travel in western North Carolina remains limited and dangerous,\" Cooper said, pointing out 280 roads are closed, including sections of I-40 and I-26. \"Please stay off western North Carolina roads.\"\n\nThe governor said Helene dropped 10 to 29 inches of rain on the mountains in parts of the state, resulting in life-threatening landslides and floods. That has prompted reports of up to 1,000 missing, and for some of their loved ones to go searching for them.\n\n“I know there are a lot of people who are concerned about relatives and friends they cannot get in touch with,’’ Cooper said. \"It’s one of the reasons we’re pushing so hard to get communications back up because we know a lot of these people are just simply out of communication and are OK.\"\n\nLines for gas and cash in flooded Ashville\n\nResidents in Asheville were scrambling for resources after widespread flooding and power outages caused gas and water shortages. Gas stations began to close on Sunday and businesses started to only accept cash, as many remain unable to process credit and debit purchases due to lack of power and spotty internet service.\n\nIn West Asheville, amid the distant clatter of chainsaws cutting through downed trees, a line gathered at BJ's Food Mart for its 9 a.m. opening. When the cash-only gas station and market opened, screams across the street could be heard: \"No gas! Cash only! No gas!\"\n\nIn downtown, an hour-and-a-half-long line had formed at the Wells Fargo building ATM. Residents were piling in to get cash for groceries, water, and gas. Some were trying to get out of town and others just wanted enough cash for the coming days.\n\n\"We came downtown looking for gas,\" Stephan Amann told the Asheville Citizen-Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"We were in line for one of the gas stations on Merrimon, but they ran out before we got there, which was inconvenient.\"\n\nAmann and his partner, who live in North Asheville, wanted to leave town but found no better options. \"We've tried, but it looks like there's really nowhere to go,\" he said.\n\n− Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nHelene the latest in increasing $1 billion-plus disasters\n\nThe U.S. has averaged eight yearly disasters that caused more than $1 billion in damage since 1980. But in the last five years, the number of such catastrophes has more than doubled to 18.\n\nHelene is only the latest, and the cost of its damage is estimated at between $15 billion and $100 billion.\n\nScientists who study the Earth's climate and weather say storms like Helene are more likely to occur in the future, prompting an insurance crisis as insurers reduce coverage on some markets – most notably Florida for storms and California for wildfires – or withdraw from them altogether.\n\n\"Natural disasters are natural disasters,\" said Ian Maki, an innkeeper in Cedar Key, Florida. \"But these don’t feel natural anymore.\"\n\nDaughter 'powerless and helpless' trying to reach her parents\n\nAs Helene battered the Southeast, LaNette Wimer sat on hold with the Red Cross for two hours Sunday morning more than a thousand miles away in Denver.\n\nWimer, 59, was searching for information about her parents, Don and Brenda Holmer, who have lived in Hendersonville, North Carolina, for the past 25 years. Hendersonville is south of Asheville, where Helene swept through leaving devastation in its wake.\n\nThe last time Wimer spoke to her family they made no mention of the coming storm, and she worries her parents, who do not have cellphones or internet access, were caught unprepared. When the storm hit, Wimer began frantically watching the news, scouring social media, and calling her parents’ landlines, getting no answer.\n\nShe said the Red Cross has agreed to do a wellness check, which could take up to 48 hours. Unsure where else to turn, Wimer said she’s been left with \"a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear, a lot of wondering.\"\n\n\"How are they eating? Do they have water? Do they have their medications?\" Wimer wondered. \"You just feel so powerless and helpless. Other than reaching out to anything I can find online, there's nothing I can do. It's very scary.\"\n\nNorth Carolina residents trying to connect with family members may call NC 211 (or 1-888-892-1162 if calling from out of state) to report missing loved ones. People in the affected areas can alert others that they are safe by checking in on Facebook crisis response or reporting themselves safe through Red Cross Reunification by calling 1-800-ED-CROSS (1-800-733-2767).\n\nHow to donate and assist Helene victims\n\nAs authorities assess Helene’s destruction along a large portion of the country, rescuers and other emergency workers have been deployed to hard-hit and isolated communities. Relief efforts and funds have also been created to help victims and survivors.\n\nFederal officials have advised against sending unsolicited donated goods or heading toward disaster-affected areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency noted there are no requests, at the moment, for donations other than money.\n\nHere are some organizations that accept donations to help those impacted by the storm:\n\nAmerican Red Cross : Red Cross volunteers from Florida to Tennessee are helping communities by providing food, disaster supplies, shelter, and additional assistance.

His department planned \"welfare checks\" at homes to check those individuals.\n\nHelene wiped out large parts of Asheville, including businesses in the beloved River Arts District. Overlooking the district, the Riverlink Bridge, a central gateway between downtown and West Asheville, has become a sort of hub for gathering as residents reel from the historic damage caused by Helene. The French Broad River crested at a record 24.67 feet Friday and was still well above its banks at 12.68 feet Sunday around noon, according to NOAA.\n\nErin Quevedo, the owner of Balm Salon on Depot Street, was ankle-deep in mud attempting to save what she could of her business.\n\n\"The salon was completely destroyed. It looks like the water came up to about five feet inside,\" Quevedo said. Five hair stylists worked at the salon along with her.\n\n\"Right now, all we're doing is we're trying to salvage what we can,\" she said, noting that only a few things, such as hairstyle tools, were salvageable. \"It's really heartbreaking. I'm not really sure what we're going to do. I think it's just kind of one step at a time.\"\n\nOn Tennessee-North Carolina border, ravaged homes and roads\n\nERWIN, Tenn. − In parts of Appalachian eastern Tennessee near the North Carolina border, the damage from Helene’s deluge was evident Sunday in washed-out bridges, closed roads, destroyed buildings and lack of power for some residents.\n\nUnicoi County officials said restoring power could take weeks. Some residents said they had relatives who were still missing.\n\nAt a church shelter in Greeneville run by the Red Cross, volunteers made pancakes early Sunday for a handful of people still sleeping on cots after being forced from their homes. In Erwin, a town of about 6,000, those impacted by the storm streamed into a local high school serving as a shelter to get hot food, bottled water and clothing. Many were trying to figure out what to do next.\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nDire situation taking a mental toll\n\nMany Asheville, North Carolina, residents expressed concerns over access to water as grocery and convenience stores have rapidly run out of supplies. Grocery stores have metered customer entrances, and the city and county had yet to establish water distribution sites as of early Sunday afternoon.\n\nBrandi Hayes, 37, and four of her children stood in a long, snaking line of more than 100 people outside the Ingles Markets in west Asheville on Sunday, hoping to buy water, bread, and other essential food items. This was one of the few open grocery stores they could find.\n\nHayes ran out of water Saturday morning and said she's gathered water from a nearby creek to flush the toilet. She tried to call her 18-year-old daughter, a student at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, to let her know she was OK, but there was no answer.\n\nHayes' 12-year-old son tried to console her as she broke down in tears and acknowledged the mental toll the disaster was taking on them.\n\n“We keep talking about (what) we’re thankful for,” Hayes said. “Some people don’t have homes.”\n\n− Jacob Biba and Will Hofmann, Asheville Citizen-Times\n\nIn West Virginia, fretting about daughter in North Carolina\n\nIn West Virginia, where the storm has left more than 35,000 homes and businesses without power, Twyla Bosley is waiting to hear back from her daughter, Sorida Gain.\n\nGain was riding out the storm in Marion, North Carolina, with her boyfriend, James McKinney, their dogs and chickens. Bosley said the last time they spoke Gain, 40, told her floodwaters had started to breach their basement.\n\n“That's been the last thing I've heard,” Bosley said. “I mean, I lost count of how many missing-person reports I made. I’ve been in contact with the sheriff's department in Marion and nothing yet.”\n\nBosley said she’s trying to stay positive, knowing that the lack of cell service and internet access is likely what’s preventing her daughter from reaching out. Still, she can’t help but worry after seeing images of the widespread flooding in Asheville, less than 40 miles southwest of Marion.\n\n“My mind goes to the worst-case scenario, you know, what if something did happen to her? What if she got trapped there?” Bosley said. “My daughter has a major fear of flood waters. She's scared to death of ‘em. I'm just hoping that she got away.”\n\nA scramble for survival:No time for shoes as Asheville family flees by boat, fearing they lost everything\n\nOver 2 feet of rain swamps North Carolina mountains\n\nOver 2 feet of rain had fallen across North Carolina's mountainous region in recent days because of a rare confluence of weather patterns over the eastern U.S. before Helene arrived in Florida on Thursday night.\n\nTiny Busick in Yancey County along the western border with Tennessee, recorded 29.58 inches in just 48 hours. In Asheville, record high levels were set on the French Broad River and the Swannanoa River near the Biltmore estate. The historic Biltmore Village nearby was nearly submerged after Helene tore through the area, according to aerial footage.\n\nAt least 5,000 emergency calls to 911 were fielded since Thursday. And with more than 200 North Carolinians requiring rescue following Helene’s torrential rains, local, state and federal officials mobilized to help. Read more here.\n\n− Josh Meyer and Dinah Voyles Pulver\n\nThousands of National Guard Troops deployed\n\nThousands of members of the National Guard have been mobilized to join search and rescue missions and clear debris after Helene battered the Southeast.\n\nThe bulk of National Guard members were deployed in Florida, where 3,900 were stationed across 21 counties to offer humanitarian relief and security as well as cleaning up debris and rescuing residents from rising floodwaters.\n\nHundreds more were activated in Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia and Tennessee, where members rescued 50 patients and staff from a hospital in Unicoi County who were trapped because of extreme flooding.\n\nMadison County, Florida, residents recall horrors of Helene\n\nHurricane Helene made landfall around 11:10 p.m. Thursday just east of the Aucilla River's mouth, roughly 40 minutes south of Madison County, Florida.\n\nWinds ripped the roof off Kenneth Butler's home, which had just been fixed after Hurricane Idalia damaged it last year. During Helene on Thursday, \"it sounded like someone was grabbing tin and just throwing it everywhere,\" he said.\n\nWater drenched the home as the storm raged on. All he and his family could hear was the sound of a train whistle.\n\nDoreen Gross and the five grandchildren who live with her did not take any chances. Gross said her boss had a fully furnished, unoccupied house he was planning to sell and let them stay in it for the storm.\n\nBut the home's sturdy walls didn't shield them from the wails of the winds. \"The whole house was rattling, (the kids) were all scared,\" Gross said. \"We were all bundled together.\"\n\nIt was the scariest thing she had ever seen, Gross said − and she survived Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Looking outside Thursday night was like watching a scene from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" she said.\n\n− Elena Barrera, the Tallahassee Democrat\n\nBiden briefed on Hurricane Helene impact\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for North Carolina and ordered federal aid to supplement local recovery efforts. Biden also approved emergency disaster relief aid for Tennessee as local officials warned the Nolichucky Dam in Greene County was on the brink of failure and urged about 100,000 residents to seek higher ground. Hours later, the National Weather Service ended its \"flash flood emergency,\" but a flood warning was still in effect.\n\nFEMA administrator Deanne Criswell will travel to Georgia on Sunday and North Carolina on Monday, the White House said, as part of the administration's effort to speed support to survivors and deploy more search and rescue teams to \"accelerate recovery efforts\" in North Carolina.\n\nHow many people are without power?\n\nThe worst power outages from Helene were in South Carolina, where nearly more than 761,000 homes and businesses were in the dark as of 11 p.m. ET, according to USA TODAY's power outage tracker.\n\nIn Georgia, more than 583,000 were without power, in addition to about 432,000 in North Carolina. Florida also had more than 137,000 customers without electricity, and Virginia had over 104,000.\n\nAuthorities have warned it will take days for services to be fully restored.\n\nWhy was Helene so destructive?\n\nForecasters began warning last Tuesday that a confluence of weather patterns was coming together that would likely soak the Southeast and even farther north. A front overhead was going to interact with a plume of moisture being pulled in ahead of Helene.\n\nThe rain \"started well ahead of the storm, training up from the Gulf into our area, and circulation around the storm pushed moisture up from the extremely warm Gulf waters,\" said David Easterling, a rain expert with NOAA's National Climate Assessment Technical Support Unit.\n\nInteractions like this, with a band of moisture ahead of a tropical storm or hurricane, are called predecessor events and they’ve been documented in the past to cause heavy rains ahead of the arrival of tropical storms and hurricanes. Jet stream winds blowing aloft at more than 115 mph provided lift that further enhanced moisture in the developing storms.\n\nAlong the Blue Ridge Mountains in North Carolina on Wednesday and Thursday, almost 10 inches of rain fell in Asheville and 8 inches in Tryon, according to preliminary weather service data. Another 6 fell over the two days in Bristol-Johnson, Tennessee, and more than 4 inches in Knoxville.\n\n−Dinah Voyles-Pulver\n\nAre other storms brewing in the Atlantic?\n\nForecasters were keeping watch on the Atlantic as hurricane season approaches its last two months.\n\nTropical Storm Joyce, which formed in the central Atlantic Ocean on Friday, was about 920 miles east-northeast of the Leeward Islands late Sunday and was gradually weakening. There was no threat to land.\n\nHurricane Isaac was about 535 miles north-northwest of the Azores moving over the open Atlantic, hurricane officials said. There was also no current threat to land.\n\nAn 11 p.m. ET advisory from the National Hurricane Center noted a tropical depression in the eastern tropical Atlantic, currently known simply as \"12,\" is expected to strengthen over the open Atlantic over the next several days. However, it's not expected to threaten the U.S.\n\nContributing: Michael Loria and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/10/03/helene-asheville-north-carolina-flooding-live-updates-recovery-thursday/75488721007/", "title": "Asheville, NC Thursday recap: Latest on Helene recovery, death toll", "text": "Asheville Citizen-Times\n\n(This article will be updated.

Manned by volunteers and special police forces alike, the hunt was fueled by community members responding to posts shared by Valdes' family, urging locals to chip in.\n\nThe discovery of what is presumed to be Valdes' body left the family reeling Monday, though they took a moment to thank helpers for their \"love and dedication.\"\n\n\"Whether you searched on foot for hours, drove across the county, brought out your boats, flew drones, reached out to businesses for footage, or donated to help her family, you have been our strength,\" the family said on Facebook.\n\nWho was Arielle Valdes?\n\nArielle Valdes was a 21-year-old North Fort Myers woman who went missing while out on a run on Wednesday, Aug. 28.\n\nShe was described by family and friends in social media posts as a \"vibrant personality and gentle soul brought so much light into the lives of those who knew her.

Jeff Landry declared four days before signing a law last week mandating that all public school classrooms – from kindergarten to college – display a Protestant Christian version of the Ten Commandments.\n\nLandry made that declaration not in his state's Capitol but nearly 600 miles away in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was the keynote speaker at a fundraiser for the Tennessee Republican Party.\n\nCourting his party's Christian nationalists with controversy is an excellent way to boost a fella's national profile. Getting sued and maybe having that case go to the U.S. Supreme Court, where a few justices might be willing to toss overboard decades of precedent, is even better.\n\nLandry was so giddy about those prospects that he didn't even notice when a young girl standing behind him during Wednesday's signing ceremony fainted and collapsed to the floor.\n\n\"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original law giver, which was Moses,\" Landry said as others rushed to the girl's aid and an analogy about priorities was born.\n\nWhat's the takeaway? This has nothing to do with children or education and everything to do with rolling back constitutional protection of and from religion.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry doesn't seem to care about the hypocrisy of his Ten Commandments law\n\nThe first 10 words of the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights in America's Constitution are about protecting us from the kinds of laws Landry just signed.\n\n\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,\" it starts, before adding \"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nTrump's campaign telling lies:Trump's daughter-in-law vows to 'protect the vote.' He tried to steal the 2020 election.\n\nThe Bill of Rights is a list of priorities. Most people put the most important stuff at the top when drawing up a list.\n\nThe Supreme Court since 1947 has held that the First Amendment guaranteeing for freedom from religion and freedom of religion – known as the establishment clause – applies to state governments.\n\nLandry may very well get that lawsuit he's so excited about\n\nHeather Weaver is as eager to sue Landry as he is to be sued. A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, Weaver told me that a lawsuit is coming this week – because this issue was already settled by the Supreme Court 44 years ago when it struck down a Kentucky law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\n\nThe nation's highest court also ruled in 2005 that three Kentucky counties violated the establishment clause by displaying the Ten Commandments in courthouses and public schools.\n\nBoth cases were 5-4 rulings, with conservative justices on the losing side.\n\nThis is a different Supreme Court, with a conservative supermajority stocked with justices – Samuel Alito comes to mind – convinced that Christians in America are somehow under threat. Alito made that claim in a college speech in May and was secretly recorded this month agreeing with an undercover liberal activist who told him that America should return to a \"place of godliness.\"\n\nRichard C. Schragger, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, said some justices have been open in recent rulings to personal displays of religiosity in secular public spaces. The court in 2022 sided with a public high school football coach who lost his job for praying on the field after games.\n\nProtecting elections:Republicans wail about secure elections while slashing funding for election security\n\nThe Louisiana law could bridge those individual actions to institutional displays because it leans into a legal test favored by some justices about religion reflecting not just faith but history and tradition.\n\n\"I think they are leaning in the direction of permitting these kinds of religious practices in school and elsewhere,\" Schragger told me. \"I think that test is designed to be more sympathetic to those kinds of practices.\"\n\nWould the Supreme Court upend precedents?\n\nRachel Laser, who leads Americans United for Separation of Church and State, will join the ACLU in the lawsuit. She agrees that Landry is eager to have that fight at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"It's no secret that the Supreme Court is sympathetic to the Christian nationalist agenda with the way they've been ruling in many cases,\" Laser said. \"The court's rulings are emboldening Christian nationalists to try to get cases before them that upends long-standing precedents in ways that favor conservative Christianity over America's commitment to religious freedoms for all.\"\n\nAnnie Laurie Gaylor, co-founder of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, is also joining the lawsuit and thinks the coalition has a good chance of winning. She noted that the high school football coach case involved players the court saw as voluntarily joining him in prayer. The Louisiana law mandates the Ten Commandments in a \"coercive\" environment because students have to attend class.\n\nBut Gaylor expects more to come. States controlled by conservative Republicans are rushing to push religion into public spaces. A similar proposal in Texas failed to become law last year.\n\n\"Christian nationalists have never seen a bad idea they didn't want to replicate,\" Gaylor told me.\n\nThe hope is that the Supreme Court justices will follow the established laws despite their own beliefs\n\nNelson Tebbe, a professor at Cornell University's Law School, also told me he thinks a majority of the Supreme Court will reject the Louisiana law, even if some justices want to embrace it.\n\n\"Under current law and current precedent that's binding on Louisiana and binding on the Supreme Court itself, this Louisiana law is flagrantly unconstitutional,\" Tebbe said.\n\nI hope he's right. I hope a majority of justices, many of whom claim to value the original intent of the men who wrote the Constitution, stick with the guiding principles in the establishment clause.\n\nThat calls for faith in our government, which lately seems more interested in testing that faith than in living up to it.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/06/27/louisiana-ten-commandments-law-visualized/74154902007/", "title": "How Louisiana's 10 Commandments law came to be.", "text": "Every public classroom in Louisiana, from elementary schools to colleges, will be required to display the Ten Commandments starting in January under a new law signed by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry on June 19.\n\nThe law, the first such legislation in the nation, is already being challenged by parents and several groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union. They say the measure is unconstitutional and filed a lawsuit against it on Monday.\n\nBut while Louisiana has drawn national attention by passing the law, it’s not the first to attempt it.\n\nOver decades, more than a dozen states have tried similar bills, including Kentucky’s landmark Stone v. Graham case decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1980. Here are a few examples:\n\nWhich states have tried – or are trying to pass – Ten Commandment bills?\n\nKentucky: 'Durable, permanent copies'\n\n◾ State law passed: June 1978.\n\n◾ What did the law say? A \"durable, permanent copy\" of Ten Commandments \"shall be displayed on a wall in each public elementary and secondary school classroom in the Commonwealth.\"\n\n◾ Reason for the law: A note on copies of the commandments read: \"The secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Voluntary contributions.\n\n◾ Law status: A Kentucky state trial court and the state supreme court upheld the law. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against it in a 5-4 decision in November 1980.\n\nOklahoma: 'One of the foundations of our nation'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? All public classrooms in Oklahoma would be required “clearly display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The Ten Commandments is one of the foundations of our nation,\" said Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, the bill’s sponsor. \"Publicly and proudly displaying them in public school classrooms will serve as a reminder of the ethics of our state and country.\"\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: Referred to the state's Appropriations and Budget Education Subcommittee on Feb. 6, where it remains.\n\nArizona: 'We have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 22.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? The measure adds the Ten Commandments to a list of historical documents that “a teacher or administrator in any school in this state may read or post in any school building.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: \"The progressive slide down in our country right now is because we have taken the Ten Commandments away from our schools,\" said bill sponsor Sen. Anthony Kern, R-Glendale, during a Feb. 22 Senate floor session.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not specified.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Not specified.\n\n◾ Bill status: The bill passed the Senate on Feb. 21 and the House on April 2. Gov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the measure on April 16.\n\nUtah: 'It is a very historical document'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 15.\n\n◾ What the bill says: As originally filed, the measure would have required schools to post a framed copy or a poster of the Ten Commandments in “a prominent location” in every building.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: “The Ten Commandments, while it is a religious document, is a very historical document in that it colored the way our founders wrote the Constitution, wrote the Declaration (of Independence),” said Rep. Michael Petersen, R-North Logan, the bill’s sponsor.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies: Schools would be required to “accept and display a donation of \"The Ten Commandments\" if a copy is not already on display.” No money was appropriated in the bill.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was changed in February. The requirement to post the Ten Commandments was dropped, but the commandments and the Magna Carta were added to a list of historical documents that educators have the option to use in curricula. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill on March 20. It’s scheduled to take effect on July 1.\n\nTexas: 'The importance of a fundamental foundation of America'\n\n◾ Bill passed: April 20, 2023.\n\n◾ What did the bill say? The measure would have required Texas classrooms to display a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments “in a conspicuous place” in every classroom.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: Sponsor Republican state Sen. Phil King, said it would help restore lost religious liberties and remind students “of the importance of a fundamental foundation” of America, reported CNN.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: At least 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ Law status: The Texas House did not vote on the bill before a deadline, in effect killing it.\n\nSouth Carolina: 'Shall display in a conspicuous place'\n\n◾ Bill passed: May 16, 2023.\n\n◾ What did bill law say? Each public elementary, middle school, and secondary school in South Carolina “shall display in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.”\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The measure was sponsored by Republican representatives Thomas Beach, 10th District; Donald McCabe, 96th District; and Joseph White, 40th District.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: 16 x 20 inches.\n\n◾ Who pays for copies? Public funds or private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The bill was referred to the House Committee on Education and Public Works where it remains.\n\nMonuments have also been challenged...\n\nOklahoma: 'Symbol of historic significance for Oklahoman and American history'\n\n◾ Introduced: Jan. 30.\n\n◾ What does the bill say? A state senator introduced the bill to return a privately funded, 6-foot-tall, 2,000-pound red granite monument bearing Ten Commandments to the Oklahoma State Capitol “as a symbol of its historic significance for Oklahoman and American history.” The monument, installed in 2012, was ordered removed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 2015 because it was religious in nature and violated the state constitution’s prohibition on using state funds or property to promote religion.\n\n◾ Reason for the bill: The bill’s sponsor, Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, said Oklahoma has a strong Christian heritage and it’s important to honor it. Bullard said a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling favoring a high school football coach who prayed on the field after each game would help the bill become law.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments copy size: Not applicable.\n\n◾ Who paid for the monument: Privately funded.\n\n◾ Bill status: The measure was not assigned to a committee and was declared dead on March 1.\n\nArkansas: 'An important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system'\n\n◾ Law passed: April 7, 2015.\n\n◾ What did the law say? The measure called for “the placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Arkansas State Capitol,” with design and site selection later determined.\n\n◾ Reason for the law: The Ten Commandments are “an important component of the moral foundation of the laws and legal system of the United States of America and of the State of Arkansas,” the bill said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 6-foot-tall granite monument weighed three tons.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? The monument was placed at the state capitol in June 2017 but was knocked over and broken by a protester in a car a day after installation. A replacement was installed in April 2018.\n\n◾ Law status: A lawsuit challenging the monument on First Amendment grounds of separation of church and state was later filed. A federal judge will decide if the case should be decided by the Arkansas Supreme Court.\n\nNew Mexico: 'A historical perspective'\n\n◾ Monument installed: 2011.\n\n◾ Why? The city council of Bloomfield, New Mexico, approved installing a Ten Commandments monument in front of city hall in 2007. Other monuments, including those for the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Gettysburg Address, were installed later.\n\n◾ Reason: Bloomfield City Manager Eric Strahl said the monuments had nothing to do with religion. “It’s the Ten Commandments from a historical perspective,” he said.\n\n◾ Ten Commandments monument size: The 5-foot-high stone monument weighed 3,400 lbs.\n\n◾ Who paid for it? Private donations.\n\n◾ What happened? A lawsuit was filed against the monument on First Amendment grounds. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled in November 2016 that the monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and ordered it removed.\n\n◾ Monument status: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October 2017, in effect letting the appeals court ruling stand.\n\nWhere else have Ten Commandments displays been disputed?\n\nOhio, 2019: A middle school in New Philadelphia removed a 1920s-era plaque that contained the Ten Commandments after objections from the Freedom From Religion Foundation on grounds of separation of church and state in 2019.\n\nTennessee: 2004: Rutherford County was sued by the ACLU for displaying the Ten Commandments in the lobby of a county courthouse. A judge ordered their removal, but a county sheriff was allowed to keep them in his office.\n\nMississippi, 2003: A Senate bill that would have allowed the Ten Commandments to be displayed on school district properties across the state was introduced in 2003. It later died in an education committee.\n\nAlabama, 2003: A federal appeals judge ordered the removal of a 2.5-ton Ten Commandment monument from the state's Judicial Building grounds after ruling it violated the Establishment clause of the First Amendment.\n\nIndiana, 2002: The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Gov. Frank O'Bannon on the proposed installation of a 7-foot monument bearing the Ten Commandments on statehouse grounds. That let stand an appeals court decision that prohibited the monument.\n\nContributing: Barbara Hoberock, The Oklahoman\n\nSource: USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Reuters; Cornell Law School's Legal Information Institute; supreme.findlaw.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/19/louisiana-federal-judge-delays-posting-ten-commandments-in-some-schools-until-hearing/74476799007/", "title": "Louisiana federal judge delays posting Ten Commandments in ...", "text": "A Louisiana federal judge has said five school systems will have to wait to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms until at least Nov. 15 as the case questioning the constitutionality of the state's new law begins in Middle District Court in Baton Rouge.\n\nThis summer, Louisiana became the first state to require that the Ten Commandments be posted in every public school and university classroom by Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John deGravelles's order said he will set a hearing Sept. 30 with a ruling expected by mid-November.\n\nThe ruling technically impacts only East Baton Rouge, Livingston, Orleans, St. Tammany and Vernon parishes, where parents and civil rights groups sued to block the new law, but the Louisiana Department of Education agreed not to issue its advice, rules and regulations on implementation before Nov. 15.\n\nA spokesman for Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill insisted the law that goes into effect Jan. 1, 2025 isn't stalled unless the court rules otherwise.\n\n\"Specifically, the five defendant school boards and the defendant individuals agreed not to post the Ten Commandments in public schools or promulgate related advice, rules or regulations before Nov. 15,\" said Lester Duhe', a spokesman for Murrill, said in a statement. \"But they and all other Louisiana schools remain subject to the law and its January 2025 compliance deadline.

Jeff Landry was asked specifically if he believes organized prayer should be allowed in schools during a Monday news conference in which he and Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill outlined their constitutional court defense of the new Ten Commandments law.\n\nLandry didn't say specifically whether he would endorse or sign a bill to allow prayer in schools if it were passed by the Legislature, but he did say students \"don't leave their First Amendment rights at the doors of school houses when they go in there.\"\n\n\"If we start from a moral perspective, maybe we'd have more peace in our society,\" he said.\n\nLandry noted that public prayer is practiced by elected governing bodies like Congress and the state Legislature.\n\n\"Every morning the U.S. House is opened for business with a prayer, and yet we deny — our government in some fashion denies our citizens the right to appreciate the very things that they elected those to the highest offices or appointed to the highest offices can endorse,\" said Landry, a former congressman.\n\nThese debates in Louisiana are happening across the country, where authorities in Republican-led states are confidently taking on constitutional protections that have previously banned religious instruction and prayer from public education.\n\nCivil rights advocates are pushing back, saying these mandates violate students' rights, and have sued in federal court seeking to block Louisiana's new Ten Commandments law.\n\nDuring this moment in American history, a legal challenge to one of these measures in the U.S. Supreme Court could land differently than in other eras, said Ira C. Lupu, a professor at George Washington University School of Law who has written on religion in the First Amendment. The new policies, he said, have a better shot at prevailing before the court's conservative majority.\n\nNone of these mandates have advanced to that stage yet.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in two separate cases in the 1960s that school-sponsored prayer and religious teaching in school violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which says the federal government cannot make laws governing the \"establishment of religion\" or prohibiting \"the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has interpreted that to mean that public schools \"may not provide religious instruction\" in a devotional manner or \"prescribe prayers to be recited by students or by school authorities.\"\n\nIf educators teach about religion as an academic subject, they must promote religious liberty and respect all religious views, including the views of those who don't believe, the federal agency says.\n\nMore:Louisiana AG asks judge to dismiss lawsuit to block Ten Commandments in classrooms\n\nGreg Hilburn covers Louisiana politics for the USA Today Network.

Jeff Landry had a remarkably frivolous and flip response earlier this year to parents suing to stop his state's mandate that every public school – from kindergarten to college – display a Protestant Christian version of the Ten Commandments.\n\n\"Tell your child not to look at them,\" Landry said in August.\n\nU.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles gave that notion the smackdown it deserved Tuesday when he issued a preliminary injunction, stopping the religious posters from being placed in schools. The Baton Rouge-based jurist called the law \"coercive and inconsistent with the history of First Amendment and public education,\" because parents, by law, must send their kids to school in the state.\n\nLiz Murrill, Louisiana's attorney general, vowed to \"immediately appeal,\" calling this \"far from over.\"\n\nAnd, of course, that was always the point here. This isn't about bolstering education in Louisiana. It's creeping Christian nationalism in search of judges who will undo American rights.\n\nLandry, Murrill and their pals trying to force religion down the throats of children in a way that obviously violates the U.S. Constitution are oh so eager to get the ultraconservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and then onto the hard-right-controlled U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe issue of religion and government is settled law. Republicans don't care.\n\nHere's a good thing to teach in public schools everywhere: The First Amendment is only 45 words long, and it packs in a guarantee for five rights – freedom of and from religion, free speech, a free press, the right to assemble and to petition your government. Religion comes first on that list of rights.\n\nThis is settled law. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1980 struck down a Kentucky law requiring that the Ten Commandments be posted in public school classrooms.\n\nNonetheless, as we saw with the Supreme Court overturning five decades of settled law when it comes to abortion rights two years ago, nothing can be considered safe or settled now.\n\nOpinion:American voters just gave Trump a get-out-of-jail-free card. Like it or not.\n\nRachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, told me it would not surprise her if Gov. Landry were gunning to get this question in front of the Supreme Court. Her group, along with the American Civil Liberties Union and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, helped parents sue Louisiana.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has already decided this issue, striking down a materially indistinguishable statue in the 1980 decision,\" Laser said. \"That precedent controls this case, and we do not expect the Supreme Court to overturn it.\"\n\nThe effort is on to rewrite Louisiana history\n\nThe groups had no choice but to play defense for constitutional rights, Annie Laurie Gaylor told me. She's co-founder the Freedom From Religion Foundation.\n\n\"Of course this is the intent of the legislature, but with a law so violative of the Constitution and student rights, a legal challenge is the only way to go and we hope to prevail,\" Gaylor said. \"It's hard to conjure up a more egregious flouting of the bar on establishing religion.\"\n\nThat precedent is even older. The Supreme Court in 1947 ruled that freedom of and from religion – known as the establishment clause – applies to state and local laws.\n\nOpinion:Louisiana law isn't about Ten Commandments. It's Christian nationalist bait for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nLandry and the Republican-controlled Louisiana Legislature challenged the law when they pushed this measure. And they tried to rewrite history to claim that the Ten Commandments have long been a prominent part of American public education, a weak ruse to suggest posting them was not about religion.\n\nA legal historian effectively disputed that claim during testimony in October. DeGravelles agreed with that Tuesday, ruling that the families who sued have a \"substantial likelihood of success\" in the case.\n\nAnd the judge said that even if Louisiana has proved the claim that the Ten Commandments were a staple of public school education, it would still violate the establishment clause.\n\nThere is an easy way for religion to be the guiding force in education: private schools\n\nThere's an easy fix here, if Republicans in Louisiana are so eager to push religion in education – encourage parents who agree with that to send their kids to private school, where that sort of thing is legal.\n\nIt's already a very popular option in the state. A report issued last year by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor said that 15% of the state's more than 775,000 students attend private schools for kindergarten through 12th grade, \"making Louisiana the second highest-ranking state in the United States, behind Hawaii,\" for private school attendance.\n\nBut that would make this something parents chose for their children, not something Landry and his Republican legislature forced on them by law. That's not the target here.\n\nThe real motivation is to force one version of a religion on everyone while using the machinery of government to mow down protections placed in law to stop exactly that.\n\nLouisiana should study up on American history. An honest reading of that subject makes clear that what the state is trying here violates everything the men who wrote the First Amendment were trying to protect.\n\nFollow USA TODAY elections columnist Chris Brennan on X, formerly known as Twitter: @ByChrisBrennan", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/08/05/religion-in-public-schools-ten-commandments-bible/74555818007/", "title": "Why a new GOP wave is calling for religion in public schools.", "text": "Oklahoma's top education official ordered public schools to teach the Bible and wants state funding for a controversial religious charter school. Louisiana leaders directed schools to display the Ten Commandments. Texas leaders proposed a curriculum that incorporates biblical lessons.\n\nAuthorities in these Republican-led states are confidently taking on constitutional protections that bar religious instruction from public education. School administrators and civil rights advocates are pushing back, saying these mandates violate students' rights.\n\nIn states where evangelical Christians make up a sizeable portion of constituents, incorporating Bible teachings into the curriculum has gained traction, said Ira C. Lupu, a professor at George Washington University School of Law who has written on religion in the First Amendment.\n\nDuring this moment in American history, a legal challenge to one of these measures in the U.S. Supreme Court could land differently than in other eras., Lupu said. The new policies, he said, have a better shot at prevailing before the court's conservative majority.\n\nNone of these mandates have advanced to that stage yet. Parents in Louisiana sued in June, challenging the policy requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments. But the case remains at the trial court level.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Jeff Landry and Ryan Walters, the superintendent of education in Oklahoma, say they are prepared to take on legal challenges from people who disagree with them. Walters told USA TODAY he believes the Supreme Court will uphold the mandate requiring religious education if someone sues and a case makes it there. He credits former President Donald Trump with being outspoken and building support for the movement during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\"The support from Trump has given us this opportunity,\" Walters said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nLeaders in other Republican-run states have contacted Walters about Oklahoma's plan, he said, which he considers a modern-day \"blueprint\" for codifying the teaching of the Bible in public schools.\n\nStories of social justice and action across the nation. Sign up for USA TODAY's This is America newsletter.\n\nWhat began campaign to bring religion into schools?\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in two separate cases in the 1960s that school-sponsored prayer and religious teaching in school violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which says the federal government cannot make laws governing the \"establishment of religion\" or prohibiting \"the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education has interpreted that to mean that public schools \"may not provide religious instruction\" in a devotional manner or \"prescribe prayers to be recited by students or by school authorities.\"\n\nIf educators teach about religion as an academic subject, they must promote religious liberty and respect all religious views, including the views of those who don't believe, the federal agency says.\n\nCourt cases challenging the use of the Bible, Ten Commandments and religious materials in classrooms have continued to crop up in the years since.\n\nOne of the most influential rulings came in 1971 when the Supreme Court ruled in Lemon v. Kurtzman that constitutional protections requiring the separation of church and state apply to public schools.\n\nIn his majority opinion, Chief Justice Warren Burger said laws about bringing religion into schools needed to pass a three-part test:\n\n◾ They must \"have a secular legislative purpose.\"\n\n◾ Their \"principal or primary effect must be one that neither promotes nor inhibits religion.\"\n\n◾ They must not foster “excessive government entanglement with religion.”\n\n\"Schools have repeatedly violated these criteria, resulting in a steady stream of litigation,\" wrote Jill Heinrich, a professor of education at Cornell College, in an article for the school.\n\nOver the last several decades, more than a dozen states tried to implement laws requiring the Ten Commandments in schools.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 1980 in Stone v. Graham that a Kentucky law requiring schools to display the Ten Commandments was unconstitutional because it violated the Lemon v. Kurtzman test.\n\nSince then, Arizona, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah have proposed measures requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms at schools.\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs vetoed the Arizona bill mandating displays of the Ten Commandments. Utah made it optional for schools to post them. A proposal in Oklahoma to make the displays optional died earlier this year when it wasn’t heard by a state House subcommittee.\n\nThe groundswell to make the Bible and the Ten Commandments a mainstay at public schools represents a shift, said Lupu, the George Washington University constitutional scholar. He views it as evangelical Christians taking advantage of an opening before a conservative majority on the high court.\n\nWhat's happening in Oklahoma schools?\n\nAt a state board of education meeting on June 27, Walters gave a directive to school leaders in Oklahoma: \"Every teacher and every classroom in the state will have a Bible in the classroom and will be teaching from the Bible in the classroom.\"\n\nAt least 14 Oklahoma districts and the state teachers union rebuked Walters' directive to incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into classes. They sent letters to parents saying they didn't plan to change the curriculum or teach the Bible despite the new requirements.\n\nThe Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office said state law already allows the Bible to be taught in classrooms, and districts have the right to choose whether they'll teach it this fall.\n\nThe Center for Education Law issued a memorandum to Oklahoma school districts calling Walters’ mandate invalid under state law, citing it as a local control issue.\n\nBut Walters says opting out is not an option.\n\n\"They will teach it because they don’t get to choose what they teach,\" he told USA TODAY. Walters said at a recent school board meeting he would hold accountable any districts that refused to comply.\n\nPeople suing the state over Walters' directive could hit roadblocks because the mandate's instructions on how the Bible should be taught are not uniform, Lupu said. This means educators have lots of latitude to interpret what it means to \"teach about the Bible.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union contends the government shouldn't be investing in Bibles. The organization said it was joining other civil rights groups in calling for Oklahoma officials to hand over records related to the mandate, including documentation showing how the state plans to pay for copies of the Bible.\n\n“Courts have repeatedly ruled that it is unconstitutional for public schools to coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise,'\" Megan Lambert, ACLU of Oklahoma Legal Director, said in the news release. \"Oklahoma children have the right to attend public school and to access the full range of school services without having government-sponsored religion imposed on them.\"\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, among the groups requesting the records, has been working to keep public institutions, including schools, secular for decades.\n\nPatrick Elliott, the nonprofit's legal director, believes a \"significant effort to push religion on other people's children in schools\" stems from a wave of \"Christian nationalism.\"\n\n\"All students are welcome at schools and when there are state efforts to really get them to believe in a certain brand of Christianity, that coerces students into religious practices and inhibits their religious liberties,\" he said.\n\nAt least 8 large Oklahoma districts:Rebuke superintendent's order to teach Bible\n\nTen Commandments in Louisiana schools\n\nThe dispute is different in Louisiana because the order issued to schools was specific and uniform: Every classroom must display the Ten Commandments.\n\nWhen Landry, the governor, signed the Louisiana bill in June he quipped that he was prepared to respond if anyone had any concerns.\n\n“I’m going home to sign a bill that places the Ten Commandments in public classrooms,” Landry said in June. “And I can’t wait to be sued.”\n\nLouisiana parents and civil liberties groups went on to sue the state, saying that requiring the Ten Commandments violates the First Amendment.\n\n\"Permanently posting the Ten Commandments in every Louisiana public-school classroom – rendering them unavoidable – unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state’s favored religious scripture,\" the complaint says.\n\nIn response, Louisiana has agreed to delay posting the Ten Commandments in public schools until at least November.

Abortion rights advocates have notched several victories in recent ballot initiatives, and Democrats widely campaigned on abortion access in the 2022 midterm elections\n\n\"We have to get elected – you have to be able to win, \" Trump told the group of religious Republicans at one point, arguing that fighting for a national abortion ban could be risky for the GOP.

While the controversial mandate has prompted outrage from civil rights groups and some Democratic lawmakers, Walters has argued that the Bible is \"foundational for education\" and a \"cornerstone of Western civilization.\"\n\nThe guidelines from Walters detail how teachers should add the Bible to their lesson plans and how it should be taught for different grades.\n\n“Immediate and complete implementation of these guidelines for the 2024-2025 school year is required,” Walters said in a memo sent to district superintendents. “This memorandum and the included standards must be provided to every teacher, as well as providing a physical copy of the Bible, the United States Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and the Ten Commandments as resources in every classroom in the school district. These documents are mandatory for the holistic education of students in Oklahoma.”\n\nBut the list of large districts that have said they won’t be altering their curriculum despite the directive has grown to at least eight.\n\nThe Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office has said state law already allows for the Bible to be taught in classrooms, but doing so is a district-by-district decision. Based on comments to the media and letters sent to patrons, most of the districts that don’t plan to implement the directive have leaned on that principle of local control in making their respective decisions concerning curriculum.\n\nThe Center for Education Law also has issued a memorandum to Oklahoma school districts calling Walters’ mandate invalid under state law. Earlier this year, the legal firm successfully represented Edmond Public Schools in the district’s lawsuit against Walters and the Oklahoma State Board of Education. Responding to that lawsuit, the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the content of school libraries was a decision to be made by a local school board, not the state board.\n\nWhere do other states stand?Louisiana requires Ten Commandments in schools.\n\n'No plans to change course from our current materials'\n\nPiedmont Public Schools, in a letter to parents, said it adheres to the current set of Oklahoma State Academic Standards, which \"acknowledge the significant influence of various religions in world history and culture.\"\n\n\"Studies include discussions on the impact of religion in shaping societies, traditions, and historical events,\" the Piedmont letter read. “However, it is important to clarify that while students learn about religion's role in historical and cultural contexts, teaching any specific religious doctrine or practice is not a part of the current standards.\"\n\nJenks Public Schools in suburban Tulsa also told parents they have \"no plans to change course from our current materials.\"\n\n“Jenks Public Schools will continue to use our current curriculum and approved resources aligned to the Oklahoma Academic Standards approved by the Oklahoma State Legislature,” the letter said.\n\nOther large districts that have indicated they won’t follow the directive, but will stick with their locally approved curriculum, are Norman Public Schools, Moore Public Schools, Stillwater Public Schools, Bixby Public Schools, Yukon Public Schools, and the Deer Creek School District.\n\nOklahoma House Democrats urged more school districts to join the eight that said they plan not to follow Walters' directive.\n\n\"The state superintendent continues to feel emboldened enough to make mandates he has no authority to implement,” said Rep. Cyndi Munson, of Oklahoma City, the House minority leader. \"This is nothing more than an attempt to strip Oklahomans of their religious freedom. The state superintendent can say this Bible mandate is not for religious purposes all he wants, but his unlawful, unfunded mandate and clear disregard for the legislative process says otherwise.\"\n\nWhat does Ryan Walters' guidance concerning Bible teaching contain?\n\nThe five-page document that lists the guidance says it “provides guidelines for teachers on how to approach incorporation in a manner that emphasizes only its historical, literary and secular benefits, ensuring compliance with legal standards and precedents.” It includes guidance on using the Bible to teach historical context, including its impact on Western civilization and U.S. history; as well as to teach its literary significance and the influence it’s had on art and music.\n\nUnder a section labeled “Implementation Strategies,” the document has subsections labeled “Textual Analysis,” “Comparative Studies,” “Historical Documents and Speeches” and “Critical Thinking and Discussion,” with ways Walters wants the Bible taught in classrooms.\n\nThe document also includes grade-specific guidelines, for students in grades five through 12. It also includes a “Legal Considerations” section. Among those instructions:\n\n“Ensure that all instruction is conducted in a neutral and objective manner. Teachers must not promote or favor any religious beliefs, focusing solely on the historical and literary aspects of the Bible.”\n\n“Acknowledge the Bible’s influence while recognizing and respecting the diversity of religious beliefs among students. Incorporate perspectives from other religious and secular traditions to provide a balanced view while remaining mindful of all rules for grade level and age level appropriate material.”\n\n“Maintain open communication with parents about the purpose and content of incorporating the Bible as an instructional support into the curriculum. Provide information on how the curriculum addresses historical and literary aspects, emphasizing that it is not an endorsement of any religious belief.”\n\n“The Bible must be used in student instruction for its historical, literary and secular value and is not to be used for religious purposes such as preaching, proselytizing or indoctrination.”\n\nNeither the original directive nor the guidance provided Wednesday indicated who would pay for the Bibles necessary to include one in every classroom, as Walters wants. There also hasn't been any indication from Walters which version, or versions, of the Bible would be acceptable to teach from.\n\nWalters vows to force school districts to comply\n\nIn ordering instruction on the Bible, Walters has cited broad authority under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, which governs state education. The law reads, in part, “School districts shall exclusively determine the instruction, curriculum, reading lists and instructional materials and textbooks, subject to any applicable provisions or requirements as set forth in law, to be used in meeting the subject matter standards. School districts may, at their discretion, adopt supplementary student assessments which are in addition to the statewide student assessments.”\n\nIn its letter to school districts, the Center for Education Law said it believes Walters did not follow the state’s Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in issuing his directive. The APA governs the actions of state agencies and requires administrative rules to be authorized by law and passed by the agency’s governing board.\n\nThe law group maintains the state Supreme Court, in its decision in Edmond’s lawsuit, “held unanimously that (the state Board of Education) may not exercise power unless the legislature has specifically delegated it that authority.”\n\nWalters believes he has the authority to issue such a directive and issued a veiled threat to districts that won’t obey it: “Some Oklahoma educators have indicated they won’t follow the law and Oklahoma standards, so let me be clear: they will comply, and I will use every means to make sure of it.”\n\nWalters' order is the latest effort by conservative-led states to spread religious teachings into public classrooms.\n\nUnder a law signed by Louisiana's governor in June, every public classroom in Louisiana will be required to display the Ten Commandments. Other state leaders, including in Texas, have also proposed a curriculum that incorporates teachings from the Bible in schools.\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/26"}]}

Is it a federal holiday? Everything to know", "text": "Presidents Day is fast approaching, which may signal to many a relaxing three-day weekend and plenty of holiday sales and bargains.\n\nBut next to Independence Day, there may not exist another American holiday that is quite so patriotic.\n\nWhile Presidents Day has come to be a commemoration of all the nation's 46 chief executives, both past and present, it wasn't always so broad. When it first came into existence – long before it was even federally recognized – the holiday was meant to celebrate just one man: George Washington.\n\nHow has the day grown from a simple celebration of the birthday of the first president of the United States? And why are we seeing all these ads for car and furniture sales on TV?\n\nHere's what to know about Presidents Day and how it came to be:\n\nWhen is Presidents Day 2024?\n\nThis year, Presidents Day is on Monday, Feb. 19.\n\nThe holiday is celebrated on the third Monday of every February because of a bill signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Taking effect three years later, the Uniform Holiday Bill mandated that three holidays – Memorial Day, Presidents Day and Veterans Day – occur on Mondays to prevent midweek shutdowns and add long weekends to the federal calendar, according to Britannica.\n\nOther holidays, including Labor Day and Martin Luther King Jr. Day, were also established to be celebrated on Mondays when they were first observed.\n\nHowever, Veterans Day was returned to Nov. 11 in 1978 and continues to be commemorated on that day.\n\nWhat does Presidents Day commemorate?\n\nPresidents Day was initially established in 1879 to celebrate the birthday of the nation's first president, George Washington. In fact, the holiday was simply called Washington's Birthday, which is still how the federal government refers to it, the Department of State explains.\n\nFollowing the death of the venerated American Revolution leader in 1799, Feb. 22, widely believed to be Washington's date of birth, became a perennial day of remembrance, according to History.com.\n\nThe day remained an unofficial observance for much of the 1800s until Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas proposed that it become a federal holiday. In 1879, President Rutherford B. Hayes signed it into law, according to History.com.\n\nWhile initially being recognized only in Washington D.C., Washington's Birthday became a nationwide holiday in 1885. The first to celebrate the life of an individual American, Washington's Birthday was at the time one of only five federally-recognized holidays – the others being Christmas, New Year's, Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July.\n\nHowever, most Americans today likely don't view the federal holiday as a commemoration of just one specific president. Presidents Day has since come to represent a day to recognize and celebrate all of the United States' commanders-in-chief, according to the U.S. Department of State.\n\nWhen the Uniform Holiday Bill took effect in 1971, a provision was included to combine the celebration of Washington’s birthday with Abraham Lincoln's on Feb. 12, according to History.com. Because the new annual date always fell between Washington's and Lincoln's birthdays, Americans believed the day was intended to honor both presidents.\n\nInterestingly, advertisers may have played a part in the shift to \"Presidents Day.\"\n\nMany businesses jumped at the opportunity to use the three-day weekend as a means to draw customers with Presidents Day sales and bargain at stores across the country, according to History.com.\n\nHow is the holiday celebrated?\n\nBecause Presidents Day is a federal holiday, most federal workers will have the day off.\n\nPart of the reason Johnson made the day a uniform holiday was so Americans had a long weekend \"to travel farther and see more of this beautiful land of ours,\" he wrote. As such, places like the Washington Monument in D.C. and Mount Rushmore in South Dakota – which bears the likenesses of Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt – are bound to attract plenty of tourists.\n\nSimilar to Independence Day, the holiday is also viewed as a patriotic celebration. As opposed to July, February might not be the best time for backyard barbecues and fireworks, but reenactments, parades and other ceremonies are sure to take place in cities across the U.S.\n\nPresidential places abound across the U.S.\n\nOpinions on current and recent presidents may leave Americans divided, but we apparently love our leaders of old enough to name a lot of places after them.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. Census Bureau pulled information from its databases showcasing presidential geographic facts about the nation's cities and states.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the census data shows that as of 2020, the U.S. is home to plenty of cities, counties and towns bearing presidential names. Specifically:\n\n94 places are named \"Washington.\"\n\n72 places are named \"Lincoln.\"\n\n67 places are named for Andrew Jackson, a controversial figure who owned slaves and forced thousands of Native Americans to march along the infamous Trail of Tears.\n\nContributing: Clare Mulroy\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In 1954, following both World War II and the Korean War, the word \"armistice\" was changed to \"veterans\" to honor veterans of all American wars.\n\nThe day Veterans Day was celebrated moved a few times over the years, but President Gerald Ford moved it back to its annual observance on the Nov. 11 date by 1978.\n\nIs Veterans Day different from Memorial Day?\n\nBesides being observed in two different months, the set purpose of Veterans Day and Memorial Day is different.\n\nMemorial Day is observed the last Monday of May each year, and is meant to honor all who served and gave their lives for their country.

It also means Labor Day is approaching, meaning the unofficial end of summer.\n\nDuring the three-day Labor Day weekend, many Americans will travel, shop for deals online and in-store and maybe sneak in one final visit to the beach or neighborhood pool.\n\nHowever, the federal holiday is much more than just the summer's last hurrah. Observed each year on the first Monday of September, Labor Day is at heart a celebration of the hard-won achievements of America's labor movement and a recognition of what workers have contributed to the nation's prosperity.\n\nHere's what to know about the Labor Day holiday, including when it is in 2024 and how it started.\n\nFlying for Labor Day weekend?TSA predicts record-breaking numbers at security\n\nWhen should you leave?The best and worst times for traffic over Labor Day Weekend 2024\n\nWhen is Labor Day in 2024?\n\nIn 2024, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept. 2.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Labor Day?\n\nRooted in the the labor movement of the 19th century, the holiday originated during a dismal time for America's workers, who faced long hours, low wages and unsafe conditions.\n\nAs labor unions and activists advocated and fought for better treatment for workers at the height of the Industrial Revolution, the idea arose to establish a day dedicated to celebrating the members of trade and labor unions, according to History.com.\n\nEven today, many Americans continue to celebrate Labor Day with parades and parties − festivities outlined in the first proposal for a holiday, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. Since those early celebrations, Labor Day is now also marked with speeches by elected officials and community leaders who emphasize the economic and civic significance of the holiday.\n\nHow did Labor Day begin?\n\nTwo workers can make a solid claim to the title of Labor Day's official founder, according to the labor department.\n\nSome records show that it was Peter J. McGuire, the co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, who in 1882 first suggested the idea for the holiday. However, recent research supports the contention that machinist Matthew Maguire proposed the holiday in 1882 while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union in New York.\n\nRegardless of which man deserves the credit, Labor Day soon became recognized by labor activists and individual states long before it became a federal holiday.\n\nOrganized by the Central Labor Union, the first Labor Day holiday was celebrated in 1882 in New York City, according to the labor department. On that day, 10,000 workers took unpaid time off to march from City Hall to Union Square, according to History.com.\n\nNew York was also the first state to introduce a bill recognizing Labor Day, but Oregon was the first to pass such a law in 1887, according to the labor department. By 1894, 32 states had adopted the holiday.\n\nWhen did Labor Day first become federally recognized?\n\nLabor Day became a national holiday in 1894 when President Grover Cleveland signed a law passed by Congress designating the first Monday in September a holiday for workers.\n\nBut the federal recognition was hard-won, having come after a wave of unrest among workers and labor activists brought the issue of workers' rights into public view.\n\nIn May that year, employees of the Pullman Palace Car Company in Chicago went on strike to protest wage cuts and the firing of union representatives, according to History.com. A month later, the government dispatched troops to Chicago to break up a boycott of the Pullman railway cars initiated by labor activist Eugene V. Debs, unleashing a wave of fatal riots.\n\nCongress quickly passed an act making Labor Day a legal holiday in the District of Columbia and the territories. By June 28, Cleveland signed it into law.\n\nEric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

In the years following, Americans paid tribute to soldiers by decorating their graves and saying prayers, according to the History Channel.\n\nIn 1868, Gen. John Logan sent out an official order designating May 30 as a day of remembrance for those who died serving in the Civil War, according to usmemorialday.org. On the first Decoration Day, 20,000 graves at Arlington Cemetery were decorated, and future President James Garfield gave a speech, the History Channel reports.\n\nNew York was the first state to recognize Decoration Day as an official holiday in 1873, usmemorialday.org reports. By 1890, all Northern states acknowledged it. The Southern states, however, chose to honor those who died in the Civil War on separate days, according to the History Channel. This continued until after World War I.\n\nFollowing World War I, Memorial Day's focus shifted to honor American soldiers who died in any war, not only the Civil War, the History Channel reports.\n\nFor many years, Memorial Day was celebrated on May 30 until the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, enacted in 1971. The act moved the holiday's date to the last Monday in May. It also established President's Day on the third Monday in February and Columbus Day on the second Monday in October, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nJust Curious for more?

But the national day of observance has been commemorated for more than 160 years, its adherents recognizing and celebrating the day when enslaved African Americans were emancipated.\n\nIts long and storied history notwithstanding, Juneteenth's resonance has grown in the past few years amid a nationwide reckoning with racial justice and the legacy of slavery in the United States.\n\nJuneteenth largely began rising to prominence in 2020 after the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, sparked protests across the country against police brutality. Works such as \"The 1619 Project,\" a docu-series based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times essay and podcast series by Nikole Hannah-Jones, have also served to keep the topic of slavery and racial inequality at the forefront of the national conversation.\n\nFor the second time on Monday, Juneteenth – known as America's Second Independence Day – will be commemorated as a federally-recognized holiday, providing millions of Americans with a paid day off and the opportunity to commemorate the end of slavery.\n\nHere's what to know about the nation's youngest federal holiday:\n\nBusiness:72 Black-owned businesses to support for Juneteenth\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, to free enslaved African Americans, it took time for word to spread.\n\nAnd even though the Emancipation Proclamation was made effective, it could not be enforced in secessionist states still under Confederate control, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nIt wasn't until more than two years later on June 19, 1865 — five months after Congress passed the 13th Amendment, which would be ratified at year's end — that Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, with 2,000 Union troops to proclaim that more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in the state were free. Though some local slave owners initially ignored the directive, Granger demanded that they comply with the proclamation.\n\nWhy is it called Juneteenth?\n\nSimply, the holiday derives its name by combining \"June\" and \"Nineteenth,\" the date that Granger issued his proclamation.\n\nThough the holiday originated in Galveston Juneteenth has since been observed annually in various parts of the United States, often broadly celebrating African American culture.\n\nBooks:12 books about the Black experience to read this Juneteenth\n\nWhen did it become a federal holiday?\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation on June 17, 2021, making Juneteenth a U.S. federal holiday after Congress passed The Juneteenth National Independence Day Act that same month.\n\nSen.

Most federal offices are closed on federal holidays, along with most banks, and mail will not be delivered.\n\nJuneteenth became an official state holiday in Texas in 1980, and many states since then have followed suit. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia recognize Juneteenth in some way, either as an official holiday, a day of observance, or something else, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAre there any national events to commemorate Juneteenth?\n\nCelebrations will take place nationwide to commemorate Juneteenth, many organized either by local governments or local activists. Public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation are also traditional.\n\nThe White House hosted a Juneteenth concert on Tuesday on the South Lawn featuring numerous acts, including Jennifer Hudson and Broadway singers.\n\nThe National Juneteenth Observance Foundation always plans a Juneteenth Freedom Festival, which this year takes place between Thursday and Saturday in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut attending events is far from the only way people can commemorate the holiday.

Both holidays usually happen every year on the second Monday of October.\n\nWho was Cristopher Columbus?\n\nChristopher Columbus is commonly known as the man who discovered America, but people like Leif Eriksson had explored the continent and various Native American tribes had lived here for centuries.\n\nReynaldo Morales, assistant professor at Northwestern University is a descendant of the Quechua peoples of Peru and teaches on American Indian, and indigenous peoples' issues in the media, and covers environmental issues facing indigenous communities around the world.\n\nHe told USA TODAY in 2023 that Columbus and his men brought a \"scope of violence reaching the level of genocide that had no precedent in the large American continent before Europeans.\"\n\nHere are some examples of the atrocities Columbus committed, as compiled by Philadelphia Magazine:\n\nColumbus cut off the hands of approximately 10,000 natives in Haiti and the Dominican Republic because they failed to provide gold every three months.\n\nHe punished minor offenses by cutting off noses and ears.\n\nColumbus and his crew hunted natives for sport and released them to hunting dogs to be ripped apart.\n\n\"We have no reason whatsoever — only because we ignore these facts — to celebrate the legacy or the figure of such criminal,\" Morales said.\n\nDo people still celebrate Columbus Day?\n\nColumbus Day is still a federal holiday though some people argue that the holiday celebrates Italian heritage while others say it glorifies the exploitation and the genocide of native peoples.\n\nAbout 29 states across the United States and Washington D.C. do not celebrate Columbus Day, approximately 216 cities have either renamed or replaced the holiday with Indigenous Peoples Day, according to information from renamecolumbusday.org.\n\nSome states recognize Indigenous Peoples Day via proclamations, others treat it as an official holiday.\n\nWhy was Columbus Day celebrated?\n\nAlthough Columbus landed in the Americas in 1492, Columbus Day as a federal holiday was not celebrated until 1937. In the same year, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress made it into a federal holiday, largely because of lobbying done by the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal and charitable organization.\n\nThe first celebration of the day was in 1792, when New York’s Columbian Order, known as Tammany Hall celebrated the 300th anniversary of the landing.\n\nA century later in 1892, then-President Benjamin Harrison issued a proclamation encouraging Americans to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the landings by Columbus.\n\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

This holiday was known as “Armistice Day,” a day set aside to honor the veterans of World War I.\n\nOver 15 years later in 1954, World War II deployed the largest number of soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen in the Nation’s history. The 83rd Congress strongly urged the Veterans service organizations to amend the holiday name by switching “Armistice” with “Veterans,” according to the DVA. On June 1, 1954, November 11 became the national holiday dedicated to honoring American Veterans of all wars.\n\nOn October 8, 1954, the first Veterans Day Proclamation was issued by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, according to the DVA.\n\nWhat is Veterans Day?\n\nWorld War I ended with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919, according to the DVA. Seven months earlier the fighting ceased when a truce between the Allied nations and Germany went into effect causing a ceasefire on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.\n\nNovember 11, 1918, is regarded as the end of “the war to end all wars,” according to the DVA. The observance of Veterans Day on Nov. 11 honors the historical importance of the date but also celebrates and honors American veterans for “their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.”\n\nWhen is Halloween 2023?:Here's why we celebrate the holiday\n\nJust Curious for more?\n\nHere at Just Curious, we're looking into all of your questions.
