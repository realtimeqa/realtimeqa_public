What's not on the menu: An invitation for the African leader to address a joint session of Congress.\n\nThat missing course has left many lawmakers fuming.\n\nEven as President Joe Biden gets ready to treat Ruto and his wife, Rachel, to a sumptuous state dinner Thursday night, some fear the absence of an honor that has been accorded to all recent visiting heads of state could leave a bitter aftertaste.\n\nMany prominent lawmakers are upset over House Speaker Mike Johnson's rejection of a joint meeting of Congress with Ruto, which was proposed by the House Committee on Foreign Affairs to \"underscore the importance of the U.S-Kenya relationship.\" His office cited \"scheduling\" issues for the denial.\n\nRuto’s trip is the first state visit by a Kenyan president to the United States in two decades and the first by an African leader since 2008. The last African leader to address Congress was Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf who spoke in the House chamber in 2006.\n\n'Affront to American diplomacy'\n\nIn a letter to Johnson, Rep. Steven Horsford, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the move an \"affront to American diplomacy,\" adding that it was \"especially troubling\" given that other heads of state who have come to the U.S. for an official visit during the 118th Congress have been invited to address Congress.\n\nThe letter, signed by more than 60 members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, demanded that Ruto be \"treated with the same respect granted to other heads of state.\"\n\nRecent heads of state including Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kashida, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol have all addressed the joint session of Congress.\n\n\"Failing to invite President Ruto sends a dangerous message to the world,\" Horsford wrote. \"About which countries the United States Congress deems worthy of addressing Congress and diminishes the importance of our nation’s relationship with the continent of Africa.\"\n\nLawmakers warn 'adversaries' are working to dent U.S. alliances\n\nAsked about his decision, Johnson’s office sent a statement to USA TODAY saying \"scheduling restraints\" were the reason for the lack of invitation.\n\n“We offered the Kenyan embassy over 90 minutes of engagement including a one-on-one visit with Speaker Johnson, bipartisan leadership meeting with Speaker Johnson, Leader Jeffries, and Committee Chairmen and Ranking Members, and a bicameral meeting,” the statement said of the meeting that took place on Wednesday.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Barbara Lee, along with other lawmakers, also wrote to Johnson pointing out how \"adversaries\" like China, Russia, and Iran were working to subvert America’s alliances, particularly in Africa.\n\nThe East African nation, which is getting ready to deploy its police force in Haiti as the Caribbean country deals with the ongoing gang crisis, is emerging as a vital African partner to the U.S. Johnson’s choice not to provide Ruto the opportunity to address Congress helps create an opening for autocratic adversaries to make inroads in African public opinion, lawmakers warned, adding: \"The people of Kenya deserve more respect.\"\n\nRuto’s visit marks 60 years of official U.S.-Kenya partnership “founded on shared values, deep cooperation, and a common vision for the future,” according to the White House. Biden is also expected to inform Congress on Thursday that he intends to designate Kenya as a major “non-NATO Ally.\" It's a designation granted by the United States to countries with close and strategic working relationships with the U.S. military and defense civilians.\n\nAmong other partnerships the two countries will work on include global peace and security, economic development, human rights, and tackling the climate crisis.\n\nThe state dinner, a glamorous diplomatic tool, will set the stage for a “friendship that will endure, helping create a shining and prosperous tomorrow,” said first lady Jill Biden.\n\nRoses and orchids\n\nOn Thursday night, guests will dine under the stars, in a pavilion made of glass and glowing with candles.\n\nThe décor for the evening reflects the first lady's love of candlelight which she favors to make guests feel as if they're at home, even when they're part of a large group, said Bryan Rafanelli, the event planner for the evening.\n\nThe space, saturated with warm pinks and reds, will be decorated with roses and orchids representing the United States and Kenya.\n\n\"As guests leave their path illuminated by our one moon,\" said Biden. \"I hope they will be filled with the same warmth that I felt on my visits to Kenya.”\n\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy is a White House correspondent for USA TODAY.

My life has been blessed beyond measure and I do know that one can only come this far by faith,” Jackson said.\n\n“Among my many blessings, and indeed the very first, is the fact that I was born in this great country,” she added. “The United States of America is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known. I was also blessed from my early days to have had a supportive and loving family. My mother and father, who have been married for 54 years, are at their home in Florida right now and I know that they could not be more proud.”\n\nRELATED: Republicans attack Biden Supreme Court pick as pawn of ‘radical Left’\n\nThough historic, the choice of Jackson will not change the ideological makeup of the court. The court currently has six conservative justices and three liberal justices – and the retiring Breyer comes from the liberal camp. The court is already poised to continue its turn toward the right with high-profile cases and rulings expected from the court in the coming months on abortion, gun control and religious liberty issues.\n\nBiden met with Jackson for her Supreme Court interview earlier this month, a senior administration official said, in a meeting that the White House managed to keep secret. Jackson received and accepted Biden’s offer in a call Thursday night, a source familiar with the decision told CNN, yet was present for DC Circuit Court hearings Friday morning.\n\nThe White House considered delaying the announcement, given the Russian invasion in Ukraine, but believed it was critical to get the second phase of the confirmation process moving, the official said.\n\nChance to excite Democrats\n\nBiden’s pick is a chance for him to fire up a Democratic base that is less excited to vote in this year’s midterm elections than it has been over the past several election cycles. The selection gives Biden a chance to deliver on one of his top campaign promises, and he’ll hope that the Black voters who were crucial to his election win will see this as a return on their investment.\n\nWhile Jackson was the leading contender, the official said the President gave “considerable weight” to other finalists, including Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.\n\nFor more than a year, the President had familiarized himself with her work, reading many of her opinions and other writings, along with those of other contenders.\n\nBut Biden was also was impressed by her life story, including her rise from federal public defender to federal appellate judge – and her upbringing as the daughter of two public school teachers and administrators.\n\n“Her parents grew up with segregation, but never gave up hope that their children would enjoy the true promise of America,” the President said Friday.\n\n“Her opinions are always carefully reasoned, tethered to precedent and demonstrate respect for how the law impacts everyday people,” Biden said. “It doesn’t mean she puts her thumb on the scale of justice one way or the other. But she understands the broader impacts of her decisions, whether it’s cases addressing the rights of workers or government service. She cares about making sure that our democracy works for the American people. She listens. She looks people in the eye – lawyers, defendants victims and families – and she strives ensure that everyone understands why she made a decision, what the law is, and what it means to them. She strives to be fair, to get it right, to do justice. That’s something all of us should remember. And it’s something I’ve thought about throughout this process.”\n\nNomination process\n\nEyes will now turn to the Senate, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds the thinnest possible majority. The President will hope that Jackson can garner bipartisan support, but Democrats will need all their members in Washington to ensure her confirmation.\n\nUnlike for most major pieces of legislation, Democrats do not need Republican help to confirm a Supreme Court justice and can do it with their 50 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a deadlock. When Jackson was confirmed to the appellate bench, she had the support of three Republican senators. Harris, whom the White House said played an active role in the selection process, was working the phones Friday morning, calling senators as the news was reported.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated that he wants to push a nominee through the process quickly, using Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate proceedings as a model for Jackson’s confirmation timeline. And Sen. Dick Durbin, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN recently that he expects to have a hearing within a few weeks of the selection.\n\nThe goal of the leadership is to have the nominee confirmed by the April 11 recess.\n\nJackson is expected to have her courtesy meetings with senators next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. It’s common for Supreme Court nominees to meet with the leadership on both sides, then members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nBiden first committed to nominating a Black female US Supreme Court justice when he was running for president in 2020. On a debate stage in South Carolina, Biden argued that his push to make “sure there’s a Black woman on the Supreme Court” was rooted in an effort to “get everyone represented.”\n\nThough there are currently no Black women serving in the United States Senate in a position to vote for the nominee, Black female House members, all Democrats, applauded Biden for “fulfilling his campaign promise.”\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio said the nomination is “something that I will remember forever.” Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said Jackson will “bring a new, necessary perspective” to the court and “will also be an inspiration to Black women and girls everywhere.” Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida said she “never dreamed that, in my lifetime, I would see a Black woman nominated” to the Supreme Court.\n\nPersonal history\n\nJackson was born in the nation’s capital but grew up in the Miami area. She was a member of the debate team at Miami Palmetto Senior High School before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard.\n\nShe also previously clerked for Breyer and served as a federal public defender in Washington – an experience that her backers say is fitting, given Biden’s commitment to putting more public defenders on the federal bench. She was also a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission and served on the federal district court in DC, as an appointee of President Barack Obama, before Biden elevated her to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nJackson thanked Breyer in her speech.\n\n“Justice Breyer, in particular, not only gave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have, but he also exemplified every day, in every way, that a Supreme Court justice can perform at the highest level of skill and integrity, while also being guided by civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit,” Jackson said. “Justice Breyer, the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat, but please know that I could never fill your shoes.”\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the appellate court, she connected her family’s professions – her parents worked in public schools – to her decision to work as a public defender.\n\n“I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service, my brother was a police officer and (was) in the military,” she said at the time, “and being in the public defenders’ office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, is a relative by marriage and introduced her at the 2013 hearing for her district court nomination.\n\nRyan also congratulated Jackson Friday.\n\n“Janna and I are incredibly happy for Ketanji and her entire family. Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, and for her integrity, is unequivocal,” Ryan said.\n\nAt the White House Friday, Jackson noted that an uncle was previously given a life sentence on drug charges, an issue of which she hasn’t previously spoken about publicly.\n\n“You may have read that I have one uncle who got caught up in the drug trade and received a life sentence,” Jackson said. “That is true, but law enforcement also runs in my family. In addition to my brother, I had two uncles who served decades as police officers, one of whom became the police chief in my hometown of Miami, Florida.”\n\nIn 2008, when Jackson was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle’s file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown’s behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had “no further involvement in the matter” after making the referral. Jackson’s chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\n“I am standing here today by the grace of God as testament to the love and support that I’ve received from my family,” Jackson added Friday.\n\nRepublicans signal potential opposition\n\nAs a judge in DC – where some of the most politically charged cases are filed – Jackson’s issued notable rulings touching on Congress’ ability to investigate the White House. As a district court judge, she wrote a 2019 opinion siding with House lawmakers who sought the testimony of then-White House Counsel Don McGahn. Last year, she was on the unanimous circuit panel that ordered disclosure of certain Trump White House documents to the House January 6 committee.\n\nAs a judge, some other notable cases she has in her record are a 2018 case brought federal employee unions where she blocked parts of executive orders issued by Trump, and a case where she ruled against Trump policies that expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge.\n\nJackson penned more than 500 opinions in the eight years she spent on the district court.\n\nThough Biden has said that he’d pick a nominee with bipartisan appeal who is “worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency,” his decision to name the first Black woman to the court is already facing Republican opposition. Several Senate Republicans have told CNN they disagreed with the President’s decision to name a Black woman to the court rather than judging a nominee squarely on their credentials, even though Ronald Reagan and Trump both said they’d name a female justice to the Supreme Court when they were on the campaign trail.\n\nEven before Biden nominated Jackson, GOP senators and Senate candidates were already concluding that she’d be far left, throwing cold water on the names floated as being on Biden’s potential short list and calling for a slow confirmation process. Still, Republicans are limited in their ability to block a Supreme Court nominee, and Jackson may win the support of some GOP senators.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine all voted for Jackson last summer when she was confirmed as a circuit court judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the second most important court in the country.\n\nCollins touted Jackson’s “impressive academic and legal credentials” following the announcement. But Graham, who had expressed support for Childs, suggested Jackson does not have his approval, saying in a tweet that the choice of Jackson “means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.” Graham added that he expects a “respectful but interesting hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called for a “rigorous, exhaustive” review of Jackson in a statement.\n\n“I also understand Judge Jackson was “impressive academic and legal credentials the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the Court itself,” McConnell said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments, reaction and background information.", "authors": ["Jake Tapper Ariane De Vogue Jeff Zeleny Betsy Klein Maegan Vazquez", "Jake Tapper", "Ariane De Vogue", "Jeff Zeleny", "Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columns/2024/10/18/opinion-nagy-why-biden-is-going-to-africa-its-not-just-about-china/75719246007/", "title": "Opinion: Nagy: Why President Joe Biden is Going to Africa – it's not ...", "text": "By Tibor Nagy\n\nSpecial for the Avalanche-Journal\n\nA U.S. President’s first responsibility is the welfare of American citizens, so it was understandable that President Biden postponed his scheduled October visit to Africa in light of Hurricanes Helene and Milton's acute threat to the Southeastern U.S. But even with the remainder of his term measured in weeks, I was relieved to see that he has now rescheduled the trip for December. As Africa’s geopolitical importance grows, a U.S. Presidential visit matters.\n\nWhile it’s not just about China; much of our engagement with Africa has to do with China. For over a decade now China has been eating America’s lunch in Africa in terms of investment, trade, presence and sadly - more and more – influence. While some folks may shrug and say, “so what,” those of us who’ve spent much of our lives dealing with Africa can offer a long list of “because.” To spare eyes glazing over, I’ll mention just a few. Africa holds 30% of the world’s mineral reserves but much larger portions of the “rare earths” - cobalt, copper, etc. - essential to 21st century life (think computers, phones, batteries, wind turbines, and yes, advanced weapons systems). While the world’s population is aging, Africa will add 796 million people of working age between now and 2050, more than the rest of the world combined. And Africa, with its 54 countries, many of which act in unison when voting in international bodies like the United Nations, can help pass or defeat resolutions, and elect or defeat candidates for important international organization positions which determine key issues for all of us: like internet regulations or assigning radio frequencies.\n\nThe Chinese ‘get’ Africa’s importance. During my many trips there as U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, I was shocked by the immense Chinese presence and influence. Everywhere I traveled I saw Chinese projects, companies, equipment, products, and workers – from all skill and professional levels. This was a huge change from when I retired after my Ambassadorship to Ethiopia in 2003. Then, the Chinese were just starting to bid on construction projects and their presence was minimal. Now, in addition to sending the highest-level Chinese officials to Africa every year, since 2006 China has also hosted the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) every three years, with the most recent being held this past September. Usually, almost every African head-of-state goes to Beijing where they get lavish individual attention and significant “deliverables.” This time Chinese President Xi promised $50 Billion in loans and investments over the next three years, the creation of one million jobs in Africa, the training of 6,000 African military members and 1,000 police, and bringing 1,000 African politicians to China to “discuss governance” (i.e., why China’s system is better than America’s). To add insult to injury, American taxpayers have provided Africa with Billions of dollars of assistance in such critical areas as health and HIV/AIDS treatment, while African nations pay for China’s projects by taking on massive debts. But Africans can see the evidence of Chinese-poured concrete while the lives we save are less visible.\n\nDuring the Trump administration the US finally woke up to how damaging China’s massive presence in Africa is to America’s interests and long-term security, and the Biden administration has followed suit. Biden hosted his own US-Africa Leaders’ Summit in 2022, and while nowhere near as grandiose as the Chinese version, it was a significant step forward. Along with much more modest “deliverables,” Biden promised to visit the continent during his presidency. As with all US Presidential trips overseas, the decision on which African country he should visit was fiercely debated. The selection of Angola – the second largest petroleum producer in Africa also holding significant reserves of 36 out of 51 critical minerals and rare earths - was a great choice.\n\nWhile Angola started out as a Marxist dictatorship after independence and retains close ties to China and Russia, its most recent President, Jao Lourenco, is charting bold new directions favorable to America. Shortly after coming to power in 2017, he slowly dismantled the corrupt nepotism of his predecessor, became active in regional peacemaking, and made known his goal to expand ties with the US. While China has constructed most of Angola’s modern infrastructure, Lourenco was one of only several African leaders who did not attend FOCAC in Beijing. Angola is also the key participant – along with Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) – of an American-led multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project which will hopefully show Africans that there are alternatives to China’s way of doing business.\n\nNamed the Lobito Corridor – for Angola’s Lobito port city – the project will develop a transportation corridor from Lobito, through a portion of the DRC, to the heart of Zambia’s Copper Belt. While the US is facilitating the project, participants include the private sector, the European Union, and several development banks. Beyond new roads and rail, the project will create a large number of jobs and improve life along the entire corridor. One major goal will be to move minerals from Zambia and DRC to Lobito so they can easily be shipped to the Americas rather than moving in the opposite direction to China. While this is just a single project, if it succeeds with its ambitions to develop the entire economy along the corridor and not just lay concrete or rails, it will showcase a model which may be more attractive to African nations than China’s extractive mercantilism.\n\nBiden going to Angola to highlight Lobito is the perfect message the U.S. needs to be sending – that we also ’get’ Africa’s importance for the 21st Century, and that America can also lead on large projects which make a major positive impact. But beyond strengthening our relations with Angola, Biden could also dramatically increase U.S. influence across Africa – especially with its booming youth – by involving one of America’s world-leading “industries”: our cutting-edge higher education system. Universities like Texas Tech are exactly the type of institutions which could partner with Africa’s quickly emerging universities to help young Africans develop skills the Continent needs to achieve its potential. Our adversaries like China don’t hesitate to use their “soft power”; neither should we. While our Presidential election will be over by the time Biden makes the trip, his going to Africa before leaving office is at least a half step forward which our next President can follow up.\n\nAmbassador Tibor Nagy was most recently Assistant Secretary of State for Africa after serving as Texas Tech’s Vice Provost for International Affairs and a 30-year career as a US Diplomat.

Meanwhile, the Queen spoke about her previous visits to the White House and the history of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Over her reign, she would meet 12 more, each man paying a degree of homage to the duty-bound woman whose very life charted a century of history.\n\nPerhaps no other person had met personally with so many American leaders or had witnessed at close range the upheavals of war, technology and politics that have defined the “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRemoved from the politics of transatlantic relations, yet still at the very center of British identity, the Queen provided American presidents a connection to their predecessors, a reminder of what a life devoted to public service looks like and a bit of uniquely royal glitz.\n\nMany emerged enchanted, spellbound or starstruck.\n\n“Whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you,” Truman told Elizabeth that day in 1951, “they immediately fall in love.”\n\nIt was a sentiment that would be repeated, in so many words, for the next 70 years, as American leaders visited her at her palaces in the United Kingdom or when she traveled to the White House.\n\n“She is truly one of my favorite people,” then-President Barack Obama said during a visit to London in 2016, after the Queen and her husband drove in their Land Rover to pick him up at Windsor Castle. “She’s an astonishing person, and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.”\n\nSome presidents, like Ronald Reagan, bonded with the Queen over horses and country life. Others, like Bill Clinton, found themselves impressed by her political aptitude.\n\nIn recent years, as she aged, presidents saw in her their own pasts. President Donald Trump said after meeting her, his Scottish-born mother would be proud. When he visited the Queen at Windsor last year, President Joe Biden said she reminded him of his own mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first state visit to Washington came in 1957, hosted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at an important moment for the new sovereign to represent her country with its most important ally.\n\nYet even Eisenhower, the commanding general of US forces in Europe during World War II, found himself humbled in the presence of the Queen.\n\n“There have been a few times in my life when I have wished that the gift of eloquence might have been conferred upon me,” he said during his toast at the state dinner. “This evening is one of those times.”\n\nAs it turned out, the Queen had a penchant for bringing out the relaxed side of the American leaders she encountered. After inviting Eisenhower to Balmoral, her estate in the Scottish Highlands where she died on Thursday, the Queen promised to provide him her recipe for scones. She followed up in a letter several months later.\n\n“Dear Mr. President,” she wrote in her scrawling, distinct hand. “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper, standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy arrived in London for a state visit in 1961, he and his glamorous wife Jacqueline were met with crowds of Britons lining the streets. The dinner was described as “pleasant,” though later there were rumors of tensions between the Queen and first lady over the guest list.\n\nKennedy, who was assassinated two years later, did not meet the Queen again. But when Britain dedicated a memorial to Kennedy in Surrey, around 20 miles outside London, the Queen paid tribute alongside Mrs. Kennedy and the slain President’s children.\n\nShe never met President Lyndon B. Johnson as his presidency became consumed by the war in Vietnam; he remained the only president she did not meet during her reign.\n\nThe Queen had already met Richard Nixon when he was serving as vice president, but met him again as president in 1969, when he paid a visit to the United Kingdom. Later, when the Queen’s children – Prince Charles and Princess Anne – visited the Nixon White House, observers thought the President seemed unusually interested, hiring bands and arranging a special ceremony.\n\nThere was even a hint of potential romance – though it didn’t pan out.\n\n“That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon,” Charles recounted in an interview with CNN in 2021.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was serving in office as the United States marked the 200th anniversary of American independence, a bicentennial that also marked its severance from Britain. Perhaps in a show of enduring US-UK ties, Ford hosted the Queen for a state dinner underneath a tent in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn a yellow chiffon gown and diamond tiara, the Queen was whisked around the dance floor by the President.\n\n“The Queen was easy to deal with,” then-first lady Betty Ford recounted in her memoir. “She was very definite about what she wanted and what she didn’t want. She loves Bob Hope and Telly Savalas, so we invited Bob Hope and Telly Savalas.”\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had a somewhat more mortifying experience during his visit to Buckingham Palace in 1977: He kissed the Queen Mother on her lips.\n\n“Nobody has done that since my husband died,” she exclaimed. Her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.\n\nNo president appeared more comfortable with the Queen than Ronald Reagan, who became the first American leader to spend the night at Windsor Castle in 1982. A shared love of horses – she the English rider; he the Western cowboy (at least in movies) – seemed to cement their relationship.\n\n“I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. He invited her the following year to his Rancho Del Cielo property in California, initially making plans for her to sail into Santa Barbara harbor on the royal yacht.\n\nA severe storm scuttled the maritime plans, forcing the Queen to arrive by airplane. At the ranch, Reagan wore a jean jacket and bolo tie to serve her and her husband a Tex-Mex lunch: enchiladas, chiles rellenos, refried beans, tacos, rice and guacamole.\n\nTheir friendship would stretch beyond Reagan’s presidency. In 1989, she granted Reagan honorary knighthood to recognize the US assistance during the Falkland Wars.\n\nWhen she came to Washington a few years later, President George H.W. Bush brought her to a Baltimore Orioles game and hosted her at the White House – where she ended up encountering another, future president.\n\nSpeaking with George W. Bush in 1991 about the new pair of boots he was wearing for her visit, the younger Bush revealed they’d been stamped with the words “God save the Queen.” That prompted her to ask if he was the black sheep of the family.\n\n“I guess so,” he acknowledged.\n\n“All families have them,” she replied.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton’s presidency, he met with the Queen during a tour of her palace and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But during a visit to London in 1997, he and his wife Hillary turned down the Queen’s invitation to tea, preferring instead to “be a tourist,” according to documents released by the UK’s National Archives last year.\n\n“The Americans said that the President and Mrs. Clinton were very grateful for HM The Queen’s invitation to tea at the Palace, but would wish to decline politely,” a note from Blair’s private secretary, Phillip Barton, revealed.\n\nStill, Clinton was impressed by the Queen’s unique abilities.\n\n“Her Majesty impressed me as someone who but for the circumstance of her birth, might have become a successful politician or diplomat. As it was, she had to be both, without quite seeming to be either,” he wrote in his memoir.\n\nMore than a decade after their chance initial meeting in his father’s White House, George W. Bush meet the queen several times, including when he became the first US president to be received with a state visit to Britain in 2003.\n\nHe would host Queen Elizabeth’s final visit to the White House in 2007; it was a symbolic nod to her first State Visit as queen 50 years earlier and marked the 400th anniversary of the English settlement of Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nDuring his welcoming remarks, he inadvertently suggested the Queen had also visited the White House in 1776 – adding 200 years to her age.\n\n“She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,” he said after winking in the monarch’s direction.\n\nThe aging queen would not return to the White House again but continued receiving American presidents in Britain. When Obama and his wife arrived in London in 2009, they came bearing an iPod loaded with footage of her previous visits to Washington, along with recordings of some of Obama’s speeches.\n\nEtiquette hawks were aghast when Michelle Obama placed her hand on the Queen, but the Queen herself did not seem to care. Speaking with aides after a dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama remarked she reminded him of his own grandmother.\n\n“She’s just like Toot, my grandmother. Courteous. Straightforward. All about what she thinks. She doesn’t suffer fools,” he said, according to a memoir by one of his aides.\n\nHis two predecessors also felt pangs of maternal memory when they encountered the queen in the final years of her life.\n\n“I was walking up and I was saying (to wife Melania): ‘Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle,’” Donald Trump told an interviewer afterward.\n\nTrump’s mother, born on the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, was enraptured by the Queen; Trump recalled her watching Elizabeth’s coronation on television. While his own visit to Windsor had awkward moments, like when he walked in front of the Queen as they were reviewing an honor guard, the Queen herself evinced no displeasure.\n\nWhen Biden visited the United Kingdom for a Group of 7 summit in 2021, the Queen made a surprise decision to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders, a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nWhen she hosted Biden later at Windsor Castle, she asked him about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nUnlike Trump or Obama, Biden is not an Anglophile. He’s a proud Irish American who has – sometimes jokingly – made references to the long British rule over his ancestors’ island.\n\nLast year also wasn’t his first time meeting the Queen; as a young senator, he’d received advice from his mother – an Irish American born with the surname Finnegan – ahead of a planned engagement with the monarch.\n\n“Don’t you bow down to her,” she told him in 1982, according to a memoir Biden published several years ago.\n\nWhen he met her last year, he did not bow. But he did remark on a familiar resemblance.\n\n“I don’t think she’ll be insulted,” he said, “but she reminded me of my mother.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/politics/white-house-shinzo-abe/index.html", "title": "President Biden 'stunned, outraged and deeply saddened' over Abe ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday said he was “stunned, outraged and deeply saddened by the news that my friend Abe Shinzo, former Prime Minister of Japan, was shot and killed while campaigning.”\n\nAbe, 67, died after being shot during a speech in Nara, Japan.\n\n“Above all, [Abe] cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy,” Biden said in a statement released by the White House. “While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family.”\n\nIn recognition of Abe’s death, Biden has ordered that the American flag at the White House and on other federal grounds be flown at half-staff until July 10.\n\nBiden told reporters Friday afternoon that he reached out to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and plans to stop by the Japanese embassy to sign a condolence book later in the day.\n\n“I tried to put a call in to the present Prime Minister, and he was – it was very late there at night. … I’m going to be stopping by to sign the condolence book in the Japanese embassy on the way to the CIA,” Biden said.\n\nThe President said that the weapon used in Abe’s murder “was a homemade weapon” and underscored the rarity of gun-related deaths in Japan compared to the US.\n\nJapan reported only one death due to firearms in 2021, according to the National Police Agency. A total of 10 firearm-related incidents were reported in the country in 2021 — up from seven in 2020.\n\nAbe’s death, the President argued, was unlikely to have “any profound, destabilizing impact on Japanese security or Japanese solidarity.”\n\nAbe was a close ally to US Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump. His relationship with Trump was especially notable given the Republican President’s attempt to warm relations with North Korea and the generally chilly reception he received from other world leaders.\n\nTrump eulogized Abe in a pair of posts to Truth Social Friday morning, calling his death “a tremendous blow to the wonderful people of Japan.”\n\n“Few people know what a great man and leader Shinzo Abe was, but history will teach them and be kind,” Trump wrote. “He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country.”\n\nThe former President also called for Abe’s assassin to be “dealt with swiftly and harshly.”\n\nAbe was the first world leader to meet with then-President elect Trump in 2016 in New York City, just two weeks after the Republican was elected. Trump hosted Abe twice in Florida during his first term, bonding over their shared love of golf while playing together at Mar-a-Lago. In 2019, Japan returned the favor by hosting a lavish state visit for Trump and his family. Abe also arranged for Trump and his wife Melania to attend a traditional sumo wrestling match, where he was awarded the “United States President’s cup.”\n\nAbe visited Hiroshima with then-President Obama in May 2016, who was the first sitting president of the US to visit the city where the first atomic bomb was dropped in 1945. Later that year, Abe would become the first prime minister from Japan to visit Pearl Harbor with a US president when he visited the base with Obama.\n\nObama on Friday said he was “shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and longtime partner.”\n\n“Former Prime Minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan,” Obama wrote on Twitter. “I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance, the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshima and Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle.”\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "authors": ["Chandelis Duster"], "publish_date": "2022/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/china-tariffs-biden-policy/index.html", "title": "Why Biden is keeping Trump's China tariffs in place | CNN Politics", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden reversed a number of the Trump administration’s policies during his first year in office – but he has left tariffs in place on $350 billion of Chinese goods that were imposed by his predecessor.\n\nSome of those tariffs, which are paid by American importers, have been in place for nearly four years. Former President Donald Trump’s controversial trade war with China began in 2018 when he slapped tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese-made goods. Over the next year, he added duties to more items after Beijing retaliated with tariffs on some American-made products.\n\nAfter months of escalation, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping came to a truce at the beginning of 2020, signing what’s known as the Phase One agreement. It reduced the rate of some of the tariffs, but left them in place, and China agreed to increase its purchases of US goods and agricultural products – setting an ambitious target of buying $200 billion more than it did before the trade war began.\n\nBut it’s becoming clear that China has failed to meet those targets. It’s on track to purchase only 60% of the goods it committed to buy, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who tracks China’s purchases.\n\nBiden suggested recently that’s the reason he’s leaving the tariffs in place, despite pressure from the American business community to remove them as companies struggle with inflation and supply chain disruptions. US importers have paid nearly $123 billion to cover the cost of the China tariffs since 2018, according to US Customs and Border Protection.\n\n“It’s uncertain,” Biden said last week at a news conference when asked if it’s time to begin lifting some of the tariffs.\n\n“I’d like to be able to be in a position where I can say they’re meeting the commitments, or more of their commitments, and be able to lift some of it. But we’re not there yet,” he added.\n\nChina falls short of Phase One commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, China committed to ramp up its purchases of US goods and agricultural projects, setting specific amounts for different categories to be bought over the next two years.\n\nEven at the time the agreement was signed, experts were skeptical China would be able to meet its pledge. When the Covid-19 pandemic slowed trade around the globe just weeks after the deal was signed, it made it even harder for Beijing to meet the targets.\n\nWhile China is importing more from the United States than it did before the tariffs were put in place, it has fallen short of its commitments.\n\nExports of US-manufactured goods, including aircraft and autos, have yet to recover to pre-trade-war levels. China has come closer to meeting its pledge when it comes to USagricultural exports, increasing its purchases of soybeans, wheat and corn. Those exports came to a near standstill in 2018.\n\nBut the Phase One agreement doesn’t dictate any repercussions in the event that China misses its goals. It’s up to Biden to decide whether to keep the tariffs in place.\n\nBiden faces pressure from the business community\n\nThe tariffs hit a wide range of Chinese-made goods, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. The duties make it more expensive for American businesses to import these goods from China, many of which are not manufactured in the US at a pace that meets the demand.\n\nAs inflation rises and supply chain disruptions continue, pressure from the business community is ramping up on the Biden administration to lift the tariffs. The move wouldn’t solve the supply chain problems, but it could help alleviate some of the inflationary pressure facing importers.\n\n“It’s never been a good time for these tariffs, and now is a particularly bad time for them,” said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association.\n\nThe new year is “really a continuation of the worst of the problems we’ve seen,” Lamar added, noting that supply chain disruptions are still causing shipping delays, some holiday goods still haven’t arrived on store shelves, and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus caused some factories and retail stores to temporarily close.\n\nBiden moves ‘slow’ on trade policy\n\nAt the start of Biden’s tenure, a large part of his focus was on domestic policy, successfully pushing an economic pandemic relief bill and eventually an infrastructure investment package through Congress.\n\nBut in October, the Biden administration made some trade policy changes. It reached an agreement with the European Union to ease Trump-era sanctions on aluminum and steel. As part of the deal, the EU also agreed to drop retaliatory tariffs against American products including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon.\n\nThe Biden administration also announced in October that it would reinstate some China tariff waivers that US importers had previously received. The process to apply for a reinstatement of expired waivers launched in the fall, but the requests are still under review. More than 2,000 exclusions were granted under the Trump administration but only 549 are eligible for another extension.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress allowed two longstanding trade programs to expire at the end of 2020 – effectively raising tariffs on a range of goods from various countries. Legislation has been introduced to renew the programs, but has yet to pass both chambers of Congress.\n\n“When it comes to trade policy, the administration is moving very slowly,” Lamar said.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/07/26/beyond-historic-zeta-phi-beta-sorority-president-on-getting-vp-kamala-harris-to-indianapolis/74556102007/", "title": "'A woman of her word': Sorority president talks getting VP Kamala ...", "text": "The energy that Zeta Phi Beta emitted when Vice President Kamala Harris visited the sorority’s national convention was massive, and Stacie NC Grant doesn't see that waning.\n\nThe sorority, one of the country’s oldest historically Black Greek-lettered organizations, has plenty in store for the city of Indianapolis before it closes out its eight-day conference at the Indiana Convention Center.\n\nWhen the presumptive Democratic nominee for U.S. president gave her keynote address on Wednesday, the sorority notched its latest first, said Grant, the international president and CEO of Zeta Phi Beta Sorority Inc.\n\n“This is beyond historic. This moment is incredible for our organization of firsts. We have carved our name in history once again, as the first Black Greek-letter organization to host the first female of color presidential nominee that represents more than one culture and experience in this country.”\n\n(Zeta Phi Beta was first Greek-letter organization to charter a chapter in Africa; it was the first to form adult and youth auxiliary groups; and it's the first, and only, National Pan-Hellenic Council sorority to be constitutionally bound to a fraternity.)\n\nGrant has been in Indianapolis since Thursday preparing for the July 23-28 meeting, with the address by the sitting vice president being a highlight.\n\nVP Kamala Harris:Her visit to Zeta Phi Beta convention in Indianapolis\n\nHow Indianapolis became an early stop in the 2024 Kamala Harris presidential election bid\n\nAt the helm of the sorority since 2022, Grant had requested Harris participate in the organization’s 2023 Zeta Day on the Hill, an annual day of workshops, forums and meetings with congressional representatives on issues that affect minority communities across the U.S.\n\nThe notice was too short for Harris to make that September event though, so Grant asked if the vice president could attend the sorority’s 2024 convention, slated for the Circle City.\n\n“You know how busy the vice president is, so we didn't know if it would be possible and it takes a long time for them to navigate her schedule to get back to confirm any appearance,” Grant said.\n\nThe Zeta leader said she got word a couple of months ago that Harris was considering the sorority's biennial convention — called the Grand Boule — as part of her scheduled appearances for July.\n\nThen in early July, Harris’ office released the list of stops that included Zeta.\n\n“I released to our membership that she would be coming, so everybody was like, ‘Oh, my gosh! The vice president is coming!” she said.\n\nHarris appeared at Essence Festival in New Orleans July 6, and then was the keynote speaker on July 10 during the convention of her own Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in Dallas.\n\nBefore the Zeta meeting though, U.S. President Joe Biden faced a deluge of calls from within his party to abandon his reelection bid. He bowed out Sunday and endorsed Harris for the party’s nomination.\n\nSuddenly, the Zetas were preparing to host the likely Democratic nominee for president and the first woman of color in that position. Harris’ mother was born in India and her father had moved to the U.S. from Jamaica.\n\n“Little did we know while I was here planning to kick off the week that the news would hit on Sunday about President Biden choosing to pass the baton. And everything changed — the excitement, the planning, the Secret Service needs, the White House conversations,” Grant said. “It was like ‘Wait, wait, wait, what happened?”\n\nWas there a possibility that Harris would cancel the Indianapolis engagement?\n\nSome questioned whether Harris would change plans and skip Indianapolis.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was later scheduled to speak before the U.S. Congress at about the same time as the Zeta Social Justice Town Hall at which Harris had committed to speak.\n\n“I did hear some rumbling of that, but she's a woman of character and a woman of her word. And I know she was committed to being here,” Grant said. “And I'm so grateful that she kept her promise because that goes a long way with our constituency.”\n\nDivine Nine:Black Greek-letter organization flexes political muscle as VP Kamala Harris runs for president\n\nThere are still days to go before the convention ends. During that time, Zeta will elect officers, participate in workshops and attend concerts and celebrate its best performing chapters. It also has had training for local women-owned startups.\n\nThis week, the sorority kicks off a nationwide initiative to help end period poverty through a partnership with Project Period, having raised $100,000 for the Indianapolis-based program that provides free menstrual hygiene products in underserved communities.\n\nZeta Phi Beta leader on the 2024 presidential election\n\nFounded in 1920 on the campus of Howard University, Zeta Phi Beta is one of the nation's oldest Black Greek-letter organizations.\n\nIndyStar spoke with the organization’s president and CEO, Stacie NC Grant about the 2024 U.S. presidential race.\n\nThe sorority, which has inducted more than 130,000 members, is meeting in Indianapolis and hosted one the first public appearances by U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris since she became a candidate for president of the United States.\n\nPresident Biden leaving the 2024 race\n\n“It stopped my heart a little bit because I've had an opportunity to build a little rapport with him, as well. He has been an excellent leader for our country, and I know how much he loves the United States of America; and I know this was not an easy decision. But I could also understand that he might want to just take some time with family, take some time to enjoy the results of the work because he will go down in history as a president that has accomplished so much more than many or most. … I was a little sad, but I was excited to know that he has given America his best and he deserves to be celebrated for that.”\n\nThe country’s progress since President Barack Obama left the White House\n\n“We've done an interesting navigational turn in some of the ways in which members of this country have not been properly respected. And from Obama to now, we've had reversals on what we never thought we would see reversals on, from the Supreme Court down. It's very challenging to think how that can be forward movement when those original cases stood the test of time for so long and were reversed because of a shift in the changing of the guard.”\n\nSupporting Kamala Harris for president\n\n“As my individual personal self, I am jumping up and down. As the official self as president I am just happy that I can educate and provide opportunities for discourse and dialogue for my members to make their personal choices. ... Speaking for my personal self, I was excited to see the work of Biden-Harris and I think it's just going to be more exciting to see what else comes from this. … I wish I could do cartwheels. Because if I could still do them, I'd be flipping all over this stage right now. But I'm excited to be a part of witnessing this history.”\n\nChoice running mate for Kamala Harris\n\n“Picking a vice presidential running mate is a critical part in the political process of being able to extend across all aisles for what's best for the country, so it'll be interesting to see how the decision is made to move forward and to allow the country to have a full opportunity to engage on who they want to see lead this nation. I don't believe in getting into all of the noise and the rhetoric. It should be on the facts. What can each candidate do to move this country forward? Period.”\n\nContact IndyStar reporter Cheryl V.

There was also the lukewarm political support his slightly younger predecessor, Donald Trump, received when he announced his recent decision to run for president in 2024.\n\nBut Biden has not been able to shake voters’ apprehensions about his age, with rhetorical gaffes and literal stumbles at times reinforcing concerns about his health and mental acuity.\n\nBiden would be an unprecedented 86 years old by the end of his second term if he were to run and win his reelection. By comparison, some of the oldest past living presidents still had years on Biden – Trump left office at the age of 74 and Ronald Reagan left office after his two terms at 77 years old.\n\nThe president, for his part, maintains that voters concerned about his age should see his record of accomplishments since taking office.\n\n“Well, they’re concerned about whether or not I can get anything done. Look what I’ve gotten done,” Biden told CNN’s Jake Tapper in October. “Name me a president in recent history that’s gotten done as much as I have in their first two years.”\n\nBiden said last month that while he has not made a formal decision about running for reelection in 2024, it is his “intention” to do so. But he’s long said it’s a decision both he and his family will decide on together. And Saturday’s wedding marks a kickoff of sorts for the tight-knit Bidens to begin earnest discussions over whether their patriarch should seek a second term.\n\nAnd the president isn’t the only Washington power reckoning with pressures to bow out.

The Inflation Reduction Act that Biden signed into law in August 2022 capped the out-of-pocket cost of insulin at $35 a month for all seniors on Medicare, according to the White House. Several pharmaceutical companies, including Eli Lilly, followed suit and limited the monthly cost of the drug to $35 per month as well. But there is no evidence Biden limited the cost of insulin beyond this.\n\nThe price of insulin was also never set at $400, though many paid about this much. The price a person pays for insulin depends on a variety of factors, including what type of insulin they are using, insurance status and whether they're eligible for a rebate from the drugmaker, according to NBC News. While estimates vary, one government study published in December 2022 reported that in 2019, the average insulin user with private insurance spent $456 on insulin annually, while those with Medicare spent $449 a year and those without health insurance paid $996, comparatively.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: He is endorsed by Border Patrol agents\n\n“The border patrolmen endorsed me, endorsed my position.”\n\nThis is partly false.\n\nThe National Border Patrol Council – the labor union that represents more than 18,000 U.S. Border Patrol agents – posted to X, formerly Twitter, minutes after Biden made the claim and said, “To be clear, we never have and never will endorse Biden.”\n\nBut the union, which endorsed Trump in 2020, supported the proposed bipartisan border agreement that Biden backed and Trump opposed, NBC News reported in February.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Illegal border crossings dropped 40% after his June directive\n\n“I've changed (the law) in a way that now you're in a situation where there are 40% fewer people coming across the border illegally.”\n\nBiden took executive action on June 4 that authorized the U.S. to turn away migrants who enter the country illegally when crossing levels are high. The policy is triggered anytime unlawful crossings hit an average of 2,500 people a day in a given week.\n\nIn remarks posted on June 26, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said Border Patrol encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border had dropped by over 40% since Biden took action.\n\nHowever, immigration experts have cautioned that it’s difficult to point to any one reason for a drop in crossings at the border, PolitiFact noted in its fact check on this claim.\n\nImmigration rights organizations have sued the Biden administration over the new asylum restrictions at the border.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Everybody wanted Roe v. Wade overturned\n\n“I put three great Supreme Court justices on the court, and they happened to vote in favor of killing Roe v. Wade and moving it back to the states. This is something that everybody wanted.”\n\nThis is not an accurate summary of public opinion on the question. Numerous polls show most Americans were not in favor of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. For example, a poll conducted by Pew Research Center in July 2022 found that 57% of respondents said they disapproved of the overturning of the landmark decision. Another PBS NewsHour/NPR/Marist poll conducted in May 2022 (before the case was decided) found that 64% of respondents were opposed to reversing Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere is little evidence opinions have changed much since the decision. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in February 2024 found that 67% of adults opposed the ruling, while a Gallup poll from June 2023 found that 60% of respondents said overturning Roe v. Wade was a “bad thing.”\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nBiden claim: Historians voted Trump ‘worst’ president in history\n\n“(Trump) was the worst in all of American history. … He can argue (the historians) are wrong, but that’s what they voted.”\n\nBiden was presumably referring to the 2024 Presidential Greatness Project Expert Survey, which is a joint project from University of Houston professor Brandon Rottinghaus and Coastal Carolina University professor Justin Vaughn.\n\nThe survey respondents in late 2023 voted Trump the lowest in “overall presidential greatness,” behind James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson and Franklin Pierce. Abraham Lincoln was rated highest. Joe Biden ranked at No. 14.\n\nRespondents included scholars who had recently published peer-reviewed academic research in related scholarly journals or academic presses and current and recent members of the Presidents & Executive Politics Section of the American Political Science Association, which the survey described as “the foremost organization of social science experts in presidential politics.”\n\nOut of 525 respondents invited to participate, the survey received 154 usable responses, yielding a 29% response rate.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: I brought in National Guard during 2020 Minnesota unrest\n\n“If I didn’t bring in the National Guard, that city (Minneapolis) would have been destroyed.”\n\nIt was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, who activated the state’s National Guard to respond to unrest following the death of George Floyd, according to a press release issued by Walz’s office on May 28, 2020.\n\nWalz said at the time that he was responding to “local leaders’ request for Minnesota National Guard assistance to protect peaceful demonstrators, neighbors and small businesses in Minnesota.”\n\nCNN reporter Daniel Dale also looked into the claim back in 2020, detailing the timeline of events provided to the network by Walz’s press secretary, Teddy Tschann. In a statement to CNN, Tschann said Walz activated the National Guard at the request of the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before the governor spoke with the White House.\n\n“Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No,” Tschann said in the statement, according to CNN.\n\nOn May 30, 2020, the Minnesota National Guard posted on Twitter, now X, that Walz had “announced the full mobilization” of the Guard for the first time since World War II.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nBiden claim: Trump praised Hitler, saying he did 'some good things'\n\n\"This is a guy who says Hitler has done some good things\"\n\nBiden's quote of Trump is a reference to comments the former president allegedly made while talking with his White House Chief of Staff, John Kelly, in 2018 during a trip to Paris, according to excerpts from an upcoming book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\n“Well, Hitler did a lot of good things,” Trump reportedly told Kelly, according to a CNN report.\n\nTrump later denied that he made the comments and denied that the conversation took place. Liz Harrington, a Trump spokesperson, told CNN the claim is \"totally false.\"\n\n\"President Trump never said this,\" Harrington said. \"It is made up fake news, probably by a general who was incompetent and was fired.\"\n\nTrump has previously faced criticism for saying immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country” and describing his political opponents as \"vermin,\" reminding many of language used by authoritarian leaders.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: Record ‘approval rating’ from VA\n\n“I had the highest approval rating in the history of the VA.”\n\nThis is both false and a mischaracterization of what the quarterly customer experience surveys from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs measure.\n\nThe Veteran Signals surveys track the proportion of servicemembers who express having trust in the VA. It's not a presidential approval rating.\n\nIt has topped 80% twice: It was at 80% in 2020 during Trump’s administration, and it reached a high of 80.4% in May under Biden.\n\nTrump made a similar version of the claim during a May rally in Wisconsin, according to a report from Wisconsin Watch.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: More illicit drugs coming into US under Biden\n\n“The number of drugs coming across our border now is the largest we’ve ever had by far.”\n\nThis is false. When measured by weight, drug seizures are trending down.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Border Patrol and Office of Field Operations seized nearly 549,000 pounds of illicit drugs in 2023, according to federal data. That’s down 16% from 2022, when 656,000 pounds of substances were confiscated. More than 900,000 pounds were seized in 2021, according to federal data.\n\nMost of the drugs involved were marijuana (150,000 pounds) and methamphetamine (140,000 pounds).\n\nFentanyl seizures were up, however, with the 27,000 pounds in 2023 accounting for nearly twice the 14,700 pounds confiscated in 2022.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Biden indicted me because I’m his political opponent\n\n“He [Biden] indicted me because I'm his opponent.”\n\nThis is false. Trump was indicted and convicted in New York for falsifying business records related to a $130,000 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. But there is no evidence Biden or his administration had anything to do with these charges. Since the charges were brought by the state of New York, Biden and the federal government are not party to the indictment and have no say in the charges, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n“When you’re dealing with state prosecutions, it’s district attorneys elected by the voters of their jurisdiction,” said Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University. “That has nothing to do with the federal government.”\n\nThe idea of Biden interfering in Trump's prosecution is further weakened by the fact that the agency under his purview declined to file charges. The Justice Department had the authority to pursue a case against Trump over the hush money circumstances but chose not to do so.\n\nIn Trump's two federal cases, things are a bit different. The charges he faces cover the hoarding of hundreds of classified documents in Florida and a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election from Biden in Washington.\n\nThere is no law that prohibits a president from involving himself in a federal case, experts acknowledged. But they also said Biden has kept himself separate from the prosecution of Trump.\n\nAdditionally, Biden publicly vowed not to speak to Attorney General Merrick Garland about any specific case. And a key reason for the November 2022 appointment of Jack Smith as special counsel for the federal cases against Trump was to add a layer of separation between the investigation and the Biden Administration.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: Food prices have 'doubled and tripled and quadrupled' under Biden\n\n\"You look at the cost of food where it's doubled and tripled and quadrupled.\"\n\nThe cost of food has gone up under Biden, but not to the extent Trump claimed.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's all-food consumer price index shows food prices rose by 25% from 2019 to 2023.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused changes in consumer behavior and led to supply chain disruptions, driving large increases in some foods. In 2022, food costs increased faster than any year since 1979, \"partly due to a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak that affected egg and poultry prices,\" according to the department's report.\n\nBut grocery prices have stabilized over the last year, increasing by just 1.2% in the past 12 months, according to the Consumer Price Index report from March 2024.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nTrump claim: No sex with porn star\n\n“I didn’t have sex with a porn star.”\n\nThis is disputed.\n\nOn May 30, a New York state jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records tied to a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels testified at trial that she had sex with Trump in July 2006 following a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.\n\nTrump has denied the sex happened.\n\nThe trial focused on a $130,000 payment that was arranged by Trump’s then-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, ahead of the 2016 presidential election, the Associated Press reported.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nTrump claim: Biden called African Americans ‘super predators’\n\n\"He did a crime bill. 1994. Where you called them super predators. African Americans. Super predators. And they've never forgotten it. They've never forgotten it.\"\n\nWhile Biden once warned of “predators” in 1993 while advocating for a 1994 crime bill he sponsored as a senator, he never referred to African Americans as “super predators.” Rather, it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton who linked that term to the 1994 crime bill, as USA TODAY previously reported\n\nWhile campaigning for her husband in 1996, Clinton praised the 1994 crime bill for curbing gangs, saying, \"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\"\n\nNotably, she did not connect this comment to Black people.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Unprecedented numbers of murders by immigrants under Biden\n\n“People are coming in and they’re killing our citizens at a level that we’ve never seen.”\n\nWhile Trump has made a version of this claim before, there is no data that points to a wave of homicides being led by people living illegally in the U.S.\n\nA review of 2024 crime data by NBC News suggests the opposite might be true. Overall crime levels have fallen in cities where a Texas program has transported migrants from the border, the network reported in February.\n\nCrime is down year over year in Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, New York and Los Angeles, according to the report. Washington experienced an increase, but officials do not attribute that spike to migrants, NBC News reported.\n\nTrump previously made a version of the claim during a speech in Eagle Pass, Texas.\n\nResearch suggests immigrants actually commit fewer crimes than people born in the U.S.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nTrump claim: The US southern border is the most dangerous place in the world\n\n“We have a border that's the most dangerous place anywhere in the world”\n\nThis is false. While deaths, disappearances and violence do occur at the U.S. southern border, there is no evidence to suggest it is the most dangerous place in the world.\n\nStatistics on border deaths vary. Customs and Border Protection data shows 171 people died at the border in fiscal year 2022, some in CBP custody and others while attempting to cross the border. The International Organization for Migration, a U.N.-related organization, documented 686 deaths and disappearances of migrants on the US-Mexico border in 2022.\n\nPlaces all over the world and even in the U.S. have more frequent deaths. For example, there were more than 700 murders in Chicago in 2022, according to the Chicago Police Department. Chicago is 228 square miles, while the U.S.-Mexico border is 1,951 miles long.\n\n-Brad Sylvester\n\nTrump claim: Corporate tax cut from 39% to 21%\n\n“The corporate tax was cut down to 21% from 39% plus beyond that.”\n\nTrump was off with one of his numbers.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did lower the corporate tax rate to 21%. But it started at 35%, not the 39% that Trump claimed.\n\nIt is unclear exactly what Trump meant with his reference to “plus beyond that.” He promised business leaders that he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, The New York Times reported June 13.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nBiden claim: Trump told Americans to inject bleach to treat COVID-19\n\n\"He said it’s not that serious, just inject a little bleach in your arm, you’ll be all right.\"\n\nBiden is referring to comments Trump made during a press conference early in the pandemic when he suggested disinfectants might be a possible treatment for COVID-19. But he overstates what Trump said.\n\nTrump's statement came after Bill Bryan, an undersecretary of science and technology at the Department of Homeland Security, discussed a new study that found sunlight and household disinfectants effectively killed the virus on surfaces or in the air.\n\n\"And then I saw the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way we could do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump, though, never directly instructed people to inject bleach or any other disinfectant. Some states issued warnings following Trump's comment, as did Lysol, which told people not to inject or ingest its products as a coronavirus treatment.\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nBiden claim: No American troops died anywhere in the world during his presidency\n\n“The truth is, I’m the only president this century that doesn’t have any - this decade - that doesn’t have any troops dying anywhere in the world, like (former President Donald Trump) did.”\n\nBiden’s comment came following a reference to hostilities in Afghanistan during Trump’s term in office.\n\nBut the notion that no troops have died in the world during Biden’s time in office is wrong.\n\nThirteen U.S. service members were killed in a suicide bombing attack near the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in August 2021, when Biden was president, as thousands tried to flee the Taliban’s takeover of the country, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nAmong the deaths were 11 Marines, one Navy hospital corpsman and one Army soldier.\n\nBiden remarked on the deaths at the time, calling them “tragic.”\n\nMore recently, three U.S. Army Reserve soldiers were killed in January at a base in Jordan in what was described as a drone attack by Iran-backed militants.\n\n–Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Hunter Biden's ongoing legal troubles sure to hang over campaign\n\nIn early June, a jury found Hunter Biden – Joe Biden's son – guilty of three federal gun charges, making him the first child of a sitting president to be convicted at trial. The situation has been politically charged as it coincides with the elder Biden's ongoing campaign for reelection.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have investigated Hunter Biden's foreign business deals, repeatedly alleging that Joe Biden was involved in influence peddling during his time as vice president. The White House has denied that allegation, calling it baseless innuendo.\n\nJoe Biden, who earlier said he wouldn't pardon his son, released a statement shortly after the jury's verdict was announced reiterating that position.\n\n“I will accept the outcome of this case and will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal,” he said. “Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that.”\n\nHunter Biden is expected to stand trial again in September in California, where he faces tax charges.\n\nBut even before his legal troubles, the president's son has been a frequent target for misinformation. Here are some of the claims we've already debunked:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Vast differences between Biden, Trump on gender identity, LGBTQ+ issues\n\nWith Pride Month winding down, LGBTQ+ issues – specifically, those related to gender identity – remain pivotal for voters in both parties.\n\nThe candidates have taken widely different positions on those issues, with President Joe Biden – hailed as the most LGBTQ-friendly president in U.S. history – marking his first day in office with an executive order on LGBTQ rights.\n\nHis administration is challenging Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, with the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the case. He also unveiled in April a set of sweeping changes to Title IX rules that protect LGBTQ+ students from discrimination based on their gender identity, but a federal judge blocked their enforcement in four states.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Donald Trump vowed in May to roll back transgender student protections “on Day 1” of his presidency by reversing an executive order issued by Biden in 2021. Trump also vowed in February 2023 to punish medical professionals and facilities that provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors and said he would support banning transgender women from women’s sports.\n\nHere are some of the false claims related to LGBTQ+ issues that we’ve debunked:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Israel’s war against Hamas sparks unrest in US as peace deal remains elusive\n\nThe Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel’s bombardment of the Gaza Strip in response, plunged President Joe Biden into the second major international conflict of his term. He has been forced to balance America’s military support for Israel with calls from the left to broker a ceasefire deal as casualties mount in the Palestinian territory.\n\nBiden said in May that it is “time for this war to end and for the day after to begin,” laying out a proposal that called for Israel to cease military operations in the Gaza Strip and Hamas to release hostages in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nBut a peace deal has proved elusive, leading to unrest on college campuses across the country after pro-Palestinian demonstrators set up protest camps. Former President Donald Trump cheered police crackdowns on demonstrators, calling them “a beautiful thing to watch.” But he’s also called on Israel to finish its war, saying the violence is hurting its standing among the international community.\n\n“Israel has to be very careful, because you're losing a lot of the world, you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get the job done,” Trump told Israeli outlet Israel Hayom in an interview posted in March. \"And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal life for Israel, and for everybody else.”\n\nThese are some claims related to the Israel-Hamas war that we’ve already addressed:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine puts spotlight on US involvement in foreign wars\n\nRussia’s war against Ukraine entered its third year in February, and the conflict has had political implications in the U.S., where pushes to approve war aid for Ukraine have been met with contentious debate over the extent of American involvement in foreign wars, the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has remained committed to supporting Ukraine and its effort to join NATO, signing a 10-year bilateral security agreement with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on June 13.\n\n“Our goal is to strengthen Ukraine’s credible defense and deterrence capabilities for the long term,” Biden said at a press conference about the agreement. “A lasting peace for Ukraine must be underwritten by Ukraine’s own ability to defend itself now and to deter future aggression anytime … in the future.”\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has said he could end the war within 24 hours of returning to the Oval Office, but he’s offered few details about his plan. The Washington Post reported Trump’s plan could include pressuring Ukraine to give up territory, which Ukraine has opposed.\n\nHere are some fact-checks about claims related to the war in Ukraine:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Fight over immigration reform plays out during presidential campaign\n\nImmigration has become one of the most heated topics of the 2024 election, as President Joe Biden grapples with high levels of crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border and former President Donald Trump vows to deport millions of migrants if re-elected.\n\nThe situation at the Southwest border – where U.S. Customs and Border Protection recorded nearly 2.5 million migrant encounters in fiscal 2023 – prompted Biden to take executive action earlier this month to implement new restrictions on asylum access.\n\nThe action came after Republican lawmakers in February blocked an immigration bill blocked by Biden that would have revamped the country’s immigration and border policies.\n\nBiden blamed the legislation’s failure to gain traction in Congress on opposition from Trump.\n\n“Now, all indications are this bill won't even move forward to the Senate floor,” Biden said at the time. “Why? A simple reason. Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it's bad for him politically.”\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pledged to reinstate policies from his first term in office and limit asylum access if elected in November. He also wants to institute a merit-based immigration system and deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement “to assist with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals,” according to his campaign website.\n\nHere are some immigration-related claims we previously debunked:\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nDebate background: Biden and Trump face age-related concerns, though both insist they're fit to serve\n\nAt 81 years old, Joe Biden is currently the oldest U.S. president ever elected. His age has been a concern for voters and a frequent target for critics, including Donald Trump, who often suggests Biden's age makes him unfit to be president.\n\nTrump is 78 years old, three years younger than Biden, but he has also faced criticism related to his age and mental acuity, including when he confused Joe Biden for Barack Obama in multiple campaign speeches.\n\nEither man would be the oldest person to take the oath of office if sworn in next January.\n\nIn February, Justice Department special counsel Robert Hur released a report indicating Biden wouldn't face charges for his handling of classified documents that included multiple comments about Biden's age and memory, describing him as an elderly man with \"diminished capacities,\" including memory loss. However, Biden and his administration pushed back, with Biden saying his \"memory is fine\" during a televised speech.\n\nWhile Trump's doctor said multiple times he was healthy during his presidency, there were – and still are – reports of him slurring words during his speeches. Late in his term, Trump was recorded slowly descending a ramp after a speech at at U.S. Military Academy at West Point, during which he used both hands to drink a glass of water. Trump dismissed concerns raised about his age after that incident, claiming the ramp was long, steep and \"very slippery.\"\n\nHere are a few of the age-related claims we've already addressed:\n\n- Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Election integrity remains key issue – even without evidence of widespread voter fraud\n\nThroughout the campaign one question has persisted: Will the candidates and their supporters trust – and abide by – the results of the election?\n\nMost recently, former President Donald Trump’s campaign and the Republican National Committee led by his daughter-in-law said they will mobilize 100,000 people in battleground states to ensure “transparency and fairness.” The move has drawn criticism from opponents who say it has the potential to lead to voter intimidation.\n\nState-level recounts, reviews and audits of the 2022 midterm elections found no indication of systemic problems with voter fraud. That’s significant because baseless allegations from Trump and his allies have penetrated the Republican Party and eroded confidence in the process.\n\nClaims questioning the integrity of the election frequently center around a handful of predictable themes that include assertions of widespread voter fraud and election “hacking.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked several false claims about the integrity of the elections:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nDebate background: Trump’s conviction, pending trials loom over debate, election\n\nThe first former U.S. president convicted of a felony will take the debate stage as an ex-president for the first time in an attempt to convince voters to give him his old job back.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s felony conviction and his three pending criminal trials continue to loom large over both the race and the debate – his first of the presidential election cycle – with President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election. Days before the debate, the judge in that case lifted the gag order restrictions that protected the witnesses and jurors. He is scheduled to be sentenced July 11 – days before the start of the Republican National Convention, during which he is expected to formally receive the party’s nomination.\n\nTrump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nTrump’s legal problems have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, at Westminster Abbey. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary General, read lessons. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivered a sermon. Toward the end of the service, the Last Post sounded before a two-minute silence was observed. The state funeral was brought to a conclusion by the Queen’s Piper, who played a Reveille, the National Anthem and a Lament.\n\nInvitations were sent over the weekend to the heads of state of countries with whom the United Kingdom has diplomatic relations. The list of leaders who attended the state funeral was long, and included leadership across the Commonwealth and around the world. Representatives of Syria, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Venezuela were absent. For most nations with an invitation, attendance extended to the head of state plus a guest.\n\nFollowing Monday’s state funeral, the coffin will be conveyed from the hall to Wellington Arch before making its final journey out of London to Windsor. The Queen’s journey will end at St. George’s Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle, where her coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault below the chapel.\n\nBiden was one of the few world leaders to arrive in his own motorcade at the Queen’s funeral, but for the last 10 days, his aides have worked behind the scenes to ensure he had as small of a footprint as possible while she was laid to rest.\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the White House was very conscious about not making the trip about Biden, reviewing protocol closely in recent days as to avoid any missteps that could potentially distract from the funeral itself. Biden traveled with a smaller staff than is typical for an overseas visit, and his aides decided against scheduling even an informal meeting with Truss while in London.\n\nInstead, the only events on Biden’s schedule were those planned in coordination with the palace, the person said.\n\nMonday’s ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge.”\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing American advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as dozens of world leaders have convened over the weekend and into Monday to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London Marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nBiden is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Monday afternoon after the funeral. During their brief visit to London, the President and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the Queen as she was lying in state, signed condolence books and attended a reception with other leaders and King Charles III.\n\nThe funeral takes place the same week world leaders are slated to convene for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Biden will hold his first bilateral meeting with Truss on Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}]}

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nDrinking black, green or oolong tea might have more benefits than a little energy boost – a certain amount could reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes, new research has found.\n\nDrinking at least four cups of any of these teas per day has been linked with a 17% lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes over an average period of 10 years, according to research published Saturday. The research, which hasn’t yet been published in a scientific journal, will be presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in Stockholm this week.\n\nThe relationship between drinking tea and type 2 diabetes risk has been previously studied, but results have been inconsistent, said Xiaying Li, the research’s first author and a postgraduate student at the Wuhan University of Science and Technology in China.\n\n“Our study showed that the association between tea consumption and (type 2 diabetes) depended on the amount of tea consumed. Only sufficient tea consumption can show clinical effects,” said Li via email. “Based on our findings, I would advise the public to consume more tea in their daily lives, if appropriate.”\n\nThe abstract authors first studied 5,199 adults with no history of type 2 diabetes who had participated in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS). The CHNS is a prospective study examining the economics, sociological issues and health of residents from nine Chinese provinces. They were recruited in 1997 and followed until 2009. At the beginning of the study, participants provided information about lifestyle factors such as food and drink habits, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption.\n\nInitially, researchers found that tea drinkers and non-drinkers in their study had a similar risk of getting type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut when researchers decided to look into whether the amount consumed among tea drinkers made a difference by undertaking a systematic review of 19 cohort studies involving more than 1 million adults from eight countries, the results were different – the more cups of green, oolong or black tea participants drank daily, the lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes was. The measures tracked across these studies were whether participants drank less than one cup of tea per day, one to three cups per day, or four or more.)\n\nThe authors cautioned that their research doesn’t prove that drinking tea reduced type 2 diabetes risk, but does suggest tea-drinking likely contributes, according to a news release. They also noted that they relied on participants’ own assessments of their tea consumption and couldn’t rule out the possibility that unmeasured lifestyle and physiological factors could have affected the results.\n\nExperts who weren’t involved in the research have agreed with the authors’ acknowledgment of the current research’s shortcomings.\n\n“It could be that people who drink more tea avoid or less often drink more harmful sugary drinks or equivalent, or that they have other health behaviors that lead them to have lower risks of type 2 diabetes,” Naveed Sattar, a professor of metabolic medicine at the University of Glasgow, said in a statement.\n\n“The findings need to be taken with a very large pinch of salt (or cup of tea),” Kevin McConway, an emeritus professor of applied statistics at The Open University in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. “The trouble with meta-analysis findings is that the devil is always in the detail, and we don’t have the detail. Which studies were included? What was their quality? Which people, from which countries, were studied?”\n\nMore research needs to be done to determine exactly how green, black or oolong tea – and the amount consumed – could affect type 2 diabetes risk, Li said in a news release.\n\n“Particular components in tea, such as polyphenols, may reduce blood glucose concentration by inhibiting the activity of α-glucosidase and/or inhibiting the activity of other enzymes, but a sufficient amount of the bioactive substance is required to be effective,” Li said.\n\nPolyphenols are substances found in many plants and give some flowers, fruits and vegetables their color, according to the National Cancer Institute. Polyphenols have antioxidant properties, which can help prevent or delay cell damage in the body. Bioactive substances are nutrients or non-nutrients in foods that affect how the body functions.\n\nThe take-home message is that lifestyle choices are important for managing type 2 diabetes risk, Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University in Birmingham in the United Kingdom, said in a statement.

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say.

Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/health/dementia-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/index.html", "title": "Dementia risk may increase if you're eating these foods, study says ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWe all eat them — ultraprocessed foods such as frozen pizza and ready-to-eat meals make our busy lives much easier. Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMen and women in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 25% faster rate of executive function decline and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared with those who ate the least amount of overly processed food.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nA lot of ultraprocessed foods\n\nThe study followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency, was performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King, and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told CNN when the study abstract was released in August.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\nThose in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were “more likely to be younger, women, White, had higher education and income, and were more likely to have never smoked, and less likely to be current alcohol consumers,” the study found.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“We say we don’t have time, but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.

Although the study doesn't directly prove cause and effect, it has raised new concerns about sugar.\n\nAlmost 26 million U.S. adults and children have diabetes. In diabetes, the body does not make enough of the hormone insulin, or it doesn't use it properly. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) get into cells, where it is used for energy. If there's an insulin problem, sugar builds up in the blood, damaging nerves and blood vessels.\n\nSTORY: Is sugar to blame for Americans' extra pounds?\n\nUSA TODAY talked to the study's lead author, Sanjay Basu, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford Prevention Research Center. He's a medical doctor and a statistician. The study was conducted while Basu was a medical resident at the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nWe also talked to endocrinologist Elizabeth Seaquist, president-elect of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association and professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota Medical School.\n\nQ: What did the study show about sugar and type 2 diabetes?\n\nBasu: It showed that obesity itself can't explain all the trends in type 2 diabetes, but a lot of the changes can be explained by sugar availability. We can't test how much sugar goes into everyone's mouth in 175 countries, but we can see how much they buy. And in every country except the U.S., most people eat almost all of what they buy. With statistics, we can't prove anything, but we can show associations.\n\nSeaquist: The study raises the hypothesis that sugar may have an impact on diabetes risk above that associated with its caloric content alone. People who are eating a lot of sugar may also be eating a lot of calories, and we know that eating more calories than you need is associated with type 2 diabetes risk.\n\nQ: Do you think it's possible that sugar can cause type 2 diabetes? If so, why?\n\nBasu: There are several laboratory studies that show that sugar has a unique effect on the pancreas and liver. It seems to trigger a reaction that leads to the body not properly responding to our natural insulin.\n\nSeaquist: I don't think we can say that yet. We know that increased calories above what you need to maintain lean body weight will increase your risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\nQ: What is your best advice to someone with diabetes or pre-diabetes on sugar intake?\n\nBasu: Frankly, the American Heart Association (AHA) put out recommendations that are quite smart. On average, we consume about 22 teaspoons a day of sugar, mostly added sugars. The heart association recommends no more than 9 teaspoons of added sugars a day for men and no more than 6 for women. But because sugar is in everything, it's hard to reach the AHA level and not be a health nut all the time.\n\nSeaquist: People should follow a well-balanced diet that provides the calories necessary to achieve their weight goals. If they are overweight, that would mean they need to eat fewer calories to facilitate weight loss. Anyone with pre-diabetes should follow the recommendations of the Diabetes Prevention Program that includes modest weight loss and 150 minutes of exercise a week.\n\nQ: Is it possible that some people are more sensitive to sugar than others?\n\nBasu: It's quite possible. We are doing a study now to determine if we can significantly reduce diabetes risk through a low-sugar diet. These kinds of studies take a long time to do. In the meantime, with my child, I would try to reduce their intake of sugar while we continue to do these studies. There's no evidence it hurts them, and there's emerging evidence that it could really help.\n\nSeaquist: This is a testable hypothesis for which we don't yet have an answer.\n\nQ: Does obesity increase the risk of type 2 diabetes? Why?\n\nBasu: It looks like it does, and overall calories contribute to obesity.\n\nSeaquist: Type 2 diabetes runs in families, which suggests that genes are important in causing type 2 diabetes. We do not yet have a test to identify who has the specific genes that render susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. For some people, becoming obese makes a person develop diabetes at a younger age than they would have had they never become obese. Obesity causes insulin resistance, and people with the genes for type 2 diabetes may be unable to make enough insulin to overcome the insulin resistance caused by the obesity.\n\nSome facts about diabetes:\n\nAlmost 26 million children and adults (8.3% of the U.S. population) in the USA have diabetes.\n\n18.8 million people are diagnosed; an additional 7 million are undiagnosed.\n\nThere are two major forms: type 1 and type 2. In adults, type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases.\n\n79 million Americans have pre-diabetes and are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nSymptoms of diabetes include thirst, hunger, tiredness, blurry vision, healing problems and frequent urination. However, not all people with diabetes have symptoms. Even if they aren't having symptoms, people who are obese, older or have a family history of diabetes, as well as African Americans, Mexican Americans and American Indians, are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nAbout one in three Americans people may develop diabetes by 2050 if something isn't done to reverse the trend, government statistics show.\n\nDiabetes may lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, foot and leg amputations and blindness.\n\nSource: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Diabetes Association", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/health/night-light-pollution-diabetes-sleep-wellness/index.html", "title": "Sleeping with light pollution linked to diabetes, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nSleeping in a room exposed to outdoor artificial light at night may increase the risk of developing diabetes, according to a study of nearly 100,000 Chinese adults.\n\nPeople who lived in areas of China with high light pollution at night were about 28% more likely to develop diabetes than people who lived in the least polluted areas, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal Diabetologia.\n\nUltimately, more than 9 million cases of diabetes in Chinese adults age 18 years and older may be due to outdoor light pollution at night, the authors said, adding the number is likely to increase as more people moved to cities.\n\nHowever, a lack of darkness affects more than urban areas. Urban light pollution is so widespread that it can affect suburbs and forest parks that may be tens, even hundreds, of miles from the light source, the authors said.\n\n“The study confirms prior research of the potential detrimental effects of light at night on metabolic function and risk for diabetes,” said Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, who was not involved in the study\n\nHealth impact of light at night\n\nPrior research has shown an association between artificial light at night and weight gain and obesity, disruptions in metabolic function, insulin secretion and the development of diabetes, and cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nA study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment.\n\nAn elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.\n\n“Healthy sleep is hugely important in preventing the development of diabetes,” said Dr. Gareth Nye, a senior lecturer of physiology at the University of Chester in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the Diabetologia study.\n\n“Studies have suggested that inconsistent sleep patterns have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe new study used data from the 2010 China Noncommunicable Disease Surveillance Study, which asked representative samples of the Chinese population about social demographics, lifestyle factors and medical and family health histories. Blood samples were collected and compared with satellite imagery of light levels in the area of China in which each person lived.\n\nThe analysis found chronic exposure to light pollution at night raised blood glucose levels and led to a higher risk of insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nAny direct link between diabetes and nighttime light pollution is still unclear, however, because living in an urban area is itself a known contributor to the development of diabetes, Nye explained.\n\n“It has been known for a long time now that living in (an) urbanised area increases your risk of obesity through increased access to high fat and convenience food, less physical activity levels due to transport links and less social activities,” Nye wrote.\n\nWays to block the light\n\nStrategies for reducing light levels at night include positioning your bed away from windows and using light-blocking window shades. If low levels of light persist, try a sleep mask to shelter your eyes.\n\nBe aware of the type of light you have in your bedroom and ban any lights in the blue spectrum, such as those emitted by electronic devices like televisions, smartphones, tablets and laptops — blue light is the most stimulating type of light, Zee said.\n\n“If you have to have a light on for safety reasons change the color. You want to choose lights that have more reddish or brownish tones,” she said. If a night light is needed, keep it dim and at floor level, so that it’s more reflected rather than next to your eye at bed level, she suggested.\n\nAvoid sleeping with the television on — if you tend to fall asleep while it’s still on, put it on a timer, Zee suggested.\n\nDim ambient lights in the evening at least two to three hours before bedtime, and if you “absolutely have to use computer or other light-emitting screens, change screen light wavelength to longer ones of orange-amber,” Zee said. “Importantly, get light during the day — daylight is healthy!”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/health/step-dementia-risk-wellness/index.html", "title": "Walk this number of steps each day to cut your risk of dementia | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nWant to reduce your risk for dementia? Slap on a step counter and start tallying your steps – you’ll need between 3,800 and 9,800 each day to reduce your risk of mental decline, according to a new study.\n\nPeople between the ages of 40 and 79 who took 9,826 steps per day were 50% less likely to develop dementia within seven years, the study found. Furthermore, people who walked with “purpose” – at a pace over 40 steps a minute – were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day.\n\n“It is a brisk walking activity, like a power walk,” said study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense, Denmark, and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\nEven people who walked approximately 3,800 steps a day at any speed cut their risk of dementia by 25%, the study found.\n\n“That would be enough, at first, for sedentary individuals,” said del Pozo Cruz in an email.\n\n“In fact, it is a message that doctors could use to motivate very sedentary older adults – 4k steps is very doable by many, even those that are less fit or do not feel very motivated,” he added. “Perhaps, more active and fitter individuals should aim for 10k, where we see maximum effects.”\n\nBut there was a even more interesting result buried in the study, according to an editorial entitled “Is 112 the New 10,000?” published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nThe largest reduction in dementia risk – 62% – was achieved by people who walked at a very brisk pace of 112 steps per minute for 30 minutes a day, the study found. Prior research has labeled 100 steps a minute (2.7 miles per hour) as a “brisk” or moderate level of intensity.\n\nThe editorial argued that individuals looking to reduce their risk of dementia focus on their walking pace over their walked distance.\n\n“While 112 steps/min is a rather brisk cadence, ’112’ is conceivably a much more tractable and less intimidating number for most individuals than ‘10,000,’ especially if they have been physically inactive or underactive,” wrote Alzheimer’s researchers Ozioma Okonkwo and Elizabeth Planalp in the editorial. Okonkwo is an associate professor in the department of medicine at the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the University of Wisconsin–Madison; Planalp is a research scientist in Okonkwo’s lab.\n\n“We do agree this is a very interesting finding,” said del Pozo Cruz via email. “Our take is that intensity of stepping matters! Over and above volume. Technology could be use to track not only number of steps but also pace and so these types of metrics can also be incorporated in commercial watches. More research is needed on this.”\n\nPeople who walked with \"purpose\" -- at a pace over 40 steps a minute -- were able to cut their risk of dementia by 57% with just 6,315 steps a day, a new study said. West Photo/Adobe Stock\n\nDon’t have a step counter? You can count the number of steps you take in 10 seconds and then multiply it by six – or the number of steps you take in six seconds and multiply it by 10. Either way works. But remember, not everyone’s steps are the same length, nor are their fitness levels. What might be a brisk pace for a 40-year-old may not be sustainable for a 70-year-old.\n\nEditor’s Note: Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain.\n\nInside the study\n\nThe study, also published Tuesday in JAMA Neurology, analyzed data from over 78,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 who wore wrist accelerometers. Researchers counted each person’s total number of steps per day, and then placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking. The researchers also analyzed peak performers – those who took the most steps within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although those 30 minutes did not have to occur on the same walk).\n\nResearchers then compared that person’s steps against their diagnosis of dementia of any type seven years later. After controlling for age, ethnicity, education, sex, socio-emotional status and how many days they wore an accelerometer, researchers also factored out such lifestyle variables as poor diet, smoking, alcohol use, medication use, sleep issues and a history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe study did have some limitations, its authors point out – it was only observational, so it cannot establish a direct cause and effect between walking and a lower risk of dementia. In addition, “the age range of participants may have resulted in limited dementia cases, meaning our results may not be generalizable to older populations,” the study said.\n\n“Because there are often considerable delays in dementia diagnosis, and this study did not include formal clinical and cognitive assessments of dementia, it is possible that the prevalence of dementia in the community was much higher,” the authors added.\n\nWhile agreeing that the findings cannot be interpreted as a direct cause and effect, “the mounting evidence in support of the benefits of physical activity for maintaining optimal brain health can no longer be disregarded,” wrote Okonkwo and Planalp.\n\n“It is time for the management of physical inactivity to be considered an intrinsic part of routine primary care visits for older adults,” they added.\n\nResearch adds up\n\nIndeed, recent research published in July has found many leisure activities, such as household chores, exercise, adult education classes and visiting with family and friends, affected dementia risk in middle-aged people.\n\nAdults who were highly engaged in physical activity such as frequent exercise had a 35% lower risk of developing dementia compared with people who were the least engaged in these activities, researchers found.\n\nRegularly doing household chores lowered risk by 21% while daily visits with family and friends lowered the risk of dementia by 15%, when compared with people who were less engaged.\n\nEveryone in the study benefited from the protective effect of physical and mental activities, whether or not they had a family history of dementia, researchers found.\n\nAnother study published in January found that exercise may slow dementia in active older people whose brains already showed signs of plaques, tangles and other hallmarks of Alzheimer’s and other cognitive diseases.\n\nThat study found exercise boosts levels of a protein known to strengthen communication between brain cells via synapses, which may be a key factor in keeping dementia at bay.\n\n“Dementia is preventable to a great extent,” said del Pozo Cruz. “Physical activity as well as other lifestyle behaviors such lack of alcohol and smoking, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and sleep can put you on the right track to avoid dementia.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/07/10/prediabetes-and-reducing-your-risk-developing-type-2-diabetes/464569001/", "title": "Prediabetes and reducing your risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes", "text": "Deb Bjorsness\n\nBenefis Diabetes Program Coordinator\n\nAccording to the 2014 National Diabetes Statistics Report, 37 percent of adults in the United States 20 years or older have prediabetes. The prevalence of prediabetes increases to 51 percent in individuals older than 65.\n\nPrediabetes is defined as having slightly elevated blood sugar, but not high enough to diagnose diabetes. If your fasting blood sugar is between 100 and 125, then you may have prediabetes.\n\nThis condition can lead to Type 2 diabetes and other serious health concerns. When blood sugar is above normal levels for a long period of time, the risk of developing health problems is increased. Prolonged high blood sugar may cause damage to the eyes, kidneys, and nerves, and can cause foot problems. Prediabetes can also increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nIt is especially worrisome that people generally don’t feel ill or any different when they have prediabetes. Therefore, it is important to be screened. If you have prediabetes, it is critical to delay or prevent the progression to Type 2 diabetes for as long as possible. The best way to reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes is to lose weight and exercise for at least 150 minutes per week.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create long-term changes in eating behaviors and activity levels, not to go on a diet or a short-term weight loss plan. Here are a few tips to follow when improving eating habits:\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\n• Eat less processed food – look for foods that have fewer and natural ingredients\n\n• Eat fresh fruit and high fiber vegetables\n\n• Choose intact whole grains versus refined, processed grains\n\n• Consider plant based or lean proteins versus fatty meats\n\n• Increase your water intake and eliminate beverages containing empty calories, such as alcohol\n\nWhen planning to increase your physical activity, take it one step at a time. Start by establishing a routine by walking each day. Slowly add more minutes to your walk each week. Eventually, plan to walk 150 minutes or more weekly. This is as easy as taking a 30-minute walk five days a week.\n\nOne study showed that individuals who lost weight and increased their activity levels reduced their risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes by 58 percent. Participants who were 60 years or older reduced their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 71 percent. The participants in this study lost 7 percent of their body weight by eating less fat and calories and exercising for at least 150 minutes per week.\n\nIn 2008, the Montana Diabetes program began offering grants to health care organizations interested in providing diabetes prevention programs modeled after the National Institutes of Health Diabetes Prevention Program. The Montana Diabetes Prevention Program’s statewide data shows that Montanans who participated in these programs lost an average of 12 pounds with 50 percent of the participants achieving at least a 5 percent weight loss and 34 percent achieving a 7 percent weight loss. Additionally, 64 percent of the participants completed at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, with an average of 193 minutes per week per person.\n\nHere at Benefis, we offer a year-long diabetes prevention program called Healthy Lifestyles. This program consists of 16 weekly classes followed by six monthly classes. Participants focus on skills and behaviors that integrate healthy eating and physical activity into their everyday life with the goal of losing weight. Being active and losing weight are critical to preventing and delaying the onset of Type 2 diabetes.\n\nIf your body mass index is over 25 and you have an additional risk factor for Type 2 diabetes such as blood pressure over 130/85, fasting blood sugar between 100 and 125, triglycerides over 200, or LDL cholesterol over 130, then the Healthy Lifestyles program might a good fit for you.\n\nHealthy Lifestyles is currently enrolling for the upcoming classes that begin on August 23 and 24.

The scientists looked at deaths from all reasons and people's body mass index (BMI), a number that considers weight and height.\n\nThe research, which got widespread news coverage, is causing some to think that their extra weight may not be the health danger that they thought it was. Are these reactions justified?\n\nUSA TODAY turned to two experts for answers: Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Walter Willett, chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nQ: Do you think being a few pounds to 30 pounds over a normal weight is hazardous to your health?\n\nFrieden: Yes, I think that increased weight carries a number of health risks, but not all weight is the same. If you work out and build muscle mass, you may increase weight and that's healthy. The study that came out this week was about death rates, it didn't cover type 2 diabetes and other health risks, which we know increase with weight.\n\nWillett: The hazards of being a few pounds overweight partly depend on how someone got there. If someone has always been muscular and is active and strong, and their blood pressure and levels of (blood) glucose and cholesterol are fine, then their health risks are probably minimal. However, if someone has gotten to this weight by putting on 10 pounds or more, has increased their waistline by more than 2 inches, or has elevations in blood pressure, glucose or cholesterol, then this weight can be a serious health risk.\n\nQ: Should people try to lose weight if they are overweight?\n\nFrieden: The key is to do things that you can stick with. Find physical activities you love doing, and do more of them -- whether that's walking or sports or playing with your kids or dancing. Being physically active is very important at any weight. Similarly, find healthy foods that you love and eat more of them, and less of unhealthy things.\n\nWillett: The large majority of overweight people have gotten there because they have added weight as adults, and almost all will have some metabolic abnormalities (such as high blood pressure) because of this. Thus, most people who are overweight will benefit from some weight loss, even if it is only a 5% loss. Even more important, for those who are not yet overweight, a weight gain of 5 pounds after age 20, even in the normal range, is a signal to pay more attention to daily physical activity and diet to prevent becoming overweight.\n\nQ: Why do you think the research found that those who are overweight are at a slightly lower risk of early death?\n\nFrieden: The science on this is complicated. There are two big unknowns. The first is what is the right method to study the relationship between body mass index and death rates. There is scientific discussion about what's the best way to do that. The second is whether BMI is the best measure. We know that BMI is an imperfect measure. Someone who is very muscular may show up as overweight when in fact they are at a healthy weight. We also know that for certain populations the health risks appear at a lower BMI. Things like waist circumference and skin-fold thickness may be more accurate for some types of analysis. But BMI is easy to use in large epidemiological studies.\n\nWillett: The most serious problem in the paper is that the normal-weight group included a mix of lean and active people, heavy smokers, patients with cancer (and) other conditions that cause weight loss, and frail elderly people who had lost weight due to rapidly declining health. Because the overweight and obese groups were compared to this mix of healthy and ill persons who have a very high risk of death, this led to the false conclusions that being overweight is beneficial and that grade 1 (moderate) obesity carries no extra risk.\n\nThe new statistics are completely misleading for anyone interested in knowing about their optimal weight. ... The paper is a pile of rubbish.\n\nIn the last several years, two other major analyses, involving the collaborative efforts of more than 150 scientists, have been conducted on the relation of body weight to mortality. These were far superior to the recent paper because they combined the original data from over 70 studies. After eliminating distortions due to the effects of serious disease on body weight, these studies showed clearly that both overweight and all grades of obesity are associated with increased mortality.\n\nQ: What is your advice to people who are 60 or more pounds overweight?\n\nFrieden: Take one step at a time. You can't run before you walk. Start by walking. Have reasonable goals of being more physically active and eating a healthier diet. It's not easy to make changes -- that's why it's so important that you make changes you can stick with. Most people can't stick with a regimen they hate.\n\nWillett: This amount of overweight is a major threat to health and greatly increases risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, arthritis and many other conditions. It will be important to work with your health care provider to find the best approach, but in most cases this will be a combination of increased physical activity and healthier eating. Often, group support will be helpful, and in a few situations the addition of medication or surgery will be appropriate.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/health/walking-blood-sugar-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Just 2 minutes of walking after eating can help blood sugar, study ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor centuries, people in the sunny Mediterranean would get up after long, leisurely meals and take a walk, often to the town square to see neighbors and socialize. Walking is so much a part of that lifestyle it is listed as a foundation of the über-healthy Mediterranean diet.\n\nThat may be one of the reasons studies have found the Mediterranean diet can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke and some cancers — all the while strengthening bones, improving brain health, warding off dementia and depression, and helping with healthy weight loss.\n\nNow you can add another reason to take a post-meal stroll — it may lower your blood sugar.\n\nThat excursion doesn’t need to take up a huge amount of your time either: Walking as little as two to five minutes after a meal can do the trick, according to a 2022 study in the journal Sports Medicine.\n\nStanding after a meal can help, too, but not as much as putting one foot in front of the other, said study coauthor Aidan Buffey, a doctoral student in the physical education and sport sciences department at the University of Limerick in Ireland.\n\nGoing for a short walk after eating may help control your blood sugar. Siam Pukkato/Adobe Stock\n\n“Intermittent standing breaks throughout the day and after meals reduced glucose on average by 9.51% compared to prolonged sitting. However, intermittent light-intensity walking throughout the day saw a greater reduction of glucose by an average of 17.01% compared to prolonged sitting,” Buffey told CNN via email.\n\n“This suggests that breaking prolonged sitting with standing and light-walking breaks throughout the day is beneficial for glucose levels,” he added.\n\nA short walk after eating can help blood sugar levels rise and fall more gradually\n\nThe meta-analysis, published in February 2022, analyzed seven studies comparing the impact of sitting, standing and walking on the body’s insulin and blood sugar levels. People in the studies were asked either to stand or walk for two to five minutes every 20 to 30 minutes over the course of a full day.\n\n“Between the seven reviewed studies, the total activity time throughout the observation was roughly 28 minutes with the standing and light walking breaks lasting between 2 to 5 minutes,” Buffey said.\n\nStanding was better than heading straight for the desk or the couch to sit when it came to blood sugar levels, but it didn’t help lower insulin in the bloodstream, the analysis found.\n\nHowever, if people went for a short walk after eating, their blood sugar levels rose and fell more gradually, and their insulin levels were more stable than either standing or sitting, the study noted.\n\nKeeping blood sugars from spiking is good for the body as large spikes and fast falls can raise the risk for diabetes and heart disease, experts say. Studies have shown blood sugar levels will spike within 60 to 90 minutes after eating, so it’s best to get moving soon after finishing a meal.\n\nMovement helps clear sugars from the bloodstream\n\nHow does movement help? Muscles need glucose to function, so movement helps clear sugars from the bloodstream — that’s the reason why many runners rely on carbo loading before a marathon or race, for example.\n\nWant to get more out of your efforts than lower blood sugars? Step up your game to meet the minimum physical activity standards for Americans: 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle strengthening activity a week.\n\n“People who are physically active for about 150 minutes a week have a 33% lower risk of all-cause mortality than those who are physically inactive,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes.\n\nTranslated, that means if you get up and move for just 21.43 minutes each day of the week, you cut your risk of dying from anything by one-third.\n\nThat’s worth the effort, right?", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/12/health/menstrual-cramps-food-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "You can fight menstrual cramps with food, studies say | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style. Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nAbout 85% of girls suffer painful bloating, cramps and abdominal pain during their monthly periods — and for some the problems can last for years.\n\n“Since menstrual pain is a leading cause of school absenteeism for adolescent girls, it’s important to explore options that can minimize the pain,” said Dr. Stephanie Faubion, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Center for Women’s Health in Jacksonville, Florida, in a statement. She was not involved in the study.\n\nBut there are behavioral adjustments girls and young women can make to reduce pain, according to a new analysis of studies. “Diet modification could be a relatively simple solution that could provide substantial relief for them,” said Faubion, who is also the medical director for The North American Menopausal Society, of the research findings.\n\nThe abstract, presented Wednesday at the annual meeting of NAMS, explored the connection between diet and dysmenorrhea, the medical term for painful periods. The lead author, Serah Sannoh, told CNN she became interested in the topic due to her own menstrual pain, which has plagued her since adolescence.\n\n“I found diets high in inflammatory foods such as animal meats, oil, sugars, salts, and coffee contribute to an increased risk of pain during a woman’s period,” said Sannoh, who conducted the research as an intern at Rutgers University’s Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. She is currently a medical student at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine in Philadelphia.\n\n“A lot of the things that young people like to eat are are highly inflammatory … lunch meats, foods full of sugars and trans fats. But if you go on an anti-inflammatory diet — fruit, vegetables, olive oil, like the Mediterranean diet — you’ll get less cramping,” said NAMS board member Dr. Monica Christmas, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe scientific evidence has shown eating a healthy diet, getting good sleep and exercising are effective measures in curtailing the duration and severity of cramps, Christmas said. But she noted it’s important women see a health care provider: “Make sure that there’s not some other medical condition that might also be contributing to the symptoms.”\n\nWhat causes the pain?\n\nAs your body prepares to menstruate, endometrial cells that built a lining in the uterus to welcome a fertilized egg begin to break down. As they do, those cells release large amounts of fatty acids called prostaglandins to make the uterine layer contract and expel the unused tissue. The body also releases prostaglandins naturally during labor to open the cervix for birth.\n\nAnti-inflammatory foods, such as salmon, vegetables, fruit and olive oil, can help minimize menstrual camps, a new analysis of studies found. Adobe Stock\n\nProstaglandins act like hormones, causing blood vessels and smooth muscles to constrict, resulting in cramping and pain. Researchers have found prostaglandin levels are higher and uterine contractions are stronger and more frequent in women with menstrual pain than women who have little or no pain, according to American Association of Family Physicians.\n\nEating inflammatory foods only adds to the discomfort, studies have found. Highly processed and high-sugar foods and fatty, greasy foods are common culprits — a 2018 study found college students who ate more snacks had more pain during their periods.\n\nAnother 2018 study of Spanish college students found women who drank cola and ate meat were more likely to suffer pain during their cycle than women who ate more vegetables and fruits. In fact, a 2020 study found women who ate fewer than two servings of fruit a day were more likely to suffer pain during their menstrual cycle.\n\nPart of the problem is an imbalance between omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, Sannoh found. Omega-3 fatty acids — found in foods such as salmon, tuna, sardines, oysters, walnuts, chia and flaxseeds — are anti-inflammatory. Studies have linked them to a reduction in risk for many chronic diseases triggered by inflammation.\n\nOmega-6 fatty acids keep skin, hair and bones healthy and help regulate metabolism, in addition to their role in the reproductive system. But too many of these fatty acids can cause inflammation when the body ultimately breaks them down into arachidonic acid, which lowers the body’s pain threshold.\n\n“From my research, I found out that people with diets high in omega-6 fatty acids, especifically those derived from animal-based products, have a higher presence of arachidonic acid in the body, which increases the amount of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins that help the uterus contract,” Sannoh said.\n\n“When you have a diet that balances omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, and you decrease the amount of inflammatory foods that you ingest, that will decrease the painful menstrual experience,” she added.\n\nTwo separate studies from 2011 and 2012 revealed women who took omega-3 fatty acid supplements reduced the intensity of menstrual discomfort enough to lower their use of ibuprofen for pain relief. And a 1996 study found a highly significant relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and milder menstrual symptoms in teens.\n\nOther solutions\n\nChanging your diet is not the only way to fight menstrual pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, reduce the production of prostaglandins, which is why they are a mainstay of treatment for cramps, Christmas said.\n\nHowever, these pain medications also have side effects. According to a 2015 Cochrane Library review of evidence, NSAIDs are linked to bloating, diarrhea, dizziness, indigestion, headaches, heartburn, high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting and on rare occasions, raised liver enzymes.\n\nCertain oral birth control pills also lower the production of prostaglandins in the uterine lining, which then reduces both blood flow and cramping. Doses of less than 35 micrograms were “effective and should be the preparation of choice,” according to a 2009 Cochrane Library review.\n\nBut if you are not interested in using these methods — or want extra relief — give an anti-inflammatory diet a try. Sannoh put her research into practice by decreasing her intake of red meat and other inflammatory foods such as sugar and coffee, and told CNN that it did decrease her menstrual pain.\n\nThere’s an added benefit to adopting an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, Christmas said.\n\n“These diets are also associated with less high blood pressure, less cardiovascular disease, less diabetes, less arthritic issues, decreased morbidity and mortality, especially after menopause,” Christmas said.\n\n“So if you can get people who are young to eat better, exercise, and live a healthier lifestyle, they’re going fare better as they age.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}]}

Some seem to believe Spotify only tracks data between Jan. 1 and Oct. 31.\n\nHowever, Spotify itself took to social media to dispel these rumors and reassure users that tracking would continue into November. On the last day of October, the audio streamer posted a Halloween-themed graphic of a jack-o'-lantern filled with candy and a message reading: \"Spotify Wrapped doesn't stop counting on October 31st.\"\n\nAside from this reassurance, it remains unclear when Spotify does stop tracking listener data. All we know is that it's sometime between Nov. 1 and whenever Wrapped drops.\n\nWhat is Spotify Wrapped?\n\nSpotify Wrapped is a year-end roundup of the songs, artists, genres, and subgenres you’ve streamed the most. Spotify has been doing personalized year in reviews for users since 2015, originally called \"Year In Review.\"\n\nTypically, Spotify Wrapped displays a user's top songs, artists and genres. Users are encouraged to share their Spotify Wrapped on social media. The streaming platform also creates a playlist with a user's 100 most streamed songs and shares fun facts like whether they're in the top 1% of Taylor Swift's listeners or what their music aura looks like.\n\nUser data is collected from Jan. 1 through the fall of that same year to produce a user's Spotify Wrapped.\n\nThe campaign also shares quirky data-driven facts about their listening habits, including what color their music aura is, what region their taste is similar to, and whether they're in the top 1% of Bad Bunny listeners.\n\nSpotify will create a presentation for each user that shows their own personal listening trends. How many times did they listen to Sabrina Carpenter's album \"Short n' Sweet?\" Or did they have Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande's rendition of \"Defying Gravity\" from the \"Wicked\" movie on repeat?\n\nIf you listened to Laufey for 30,000 minutes, your Spotify Wrapped will tell you and maybe ask if you're ok (just kidding, no one who listens to that much Laufey is ok.)\n\nSo, this one unique feature people go gaga over every year lets them know everything they need to know about their 2024 music preferences, including if they're one of Lady Gaga's top 0.05% of listeners.\n\nHow much is Spotify Premium?\n\nSpotify offers four types of Premium accounts, including a special offer for an Individual Premium account that expires at the end of the year.

How many times did they listen to Sabrina Carpenter's album \"Short n' Sweet?\" Or did they have Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande's rendition of \"Defying Gravity\" from the \"Wicked\" movie on repeat?\n\nIf you listened to Laufey for 30,000 minutes, your Spotify Wrapped will tell you and maybe ask if you're ok (just kidding, no one who listens to that much Laufey is ok.)\n\nSo, this one unique feature people go gaga over every year lets them know everything they need to know about their 2024 music preferences, including if they're one of Lady Gaga's top 0.05% of listeners.\n\nWhen does Spotify Wrapped start tracking?\n\nSpotify always resumes tracking listener data at the start of the new year.

With up to three distinct phases, the concept feels appropriate for 2024, in which Taylor Swift broke records with her \"Eras Tour\" and changed the lexicon as laypeople began coining their own \"eras.\"\n\nIn this year's Spotify Wrappeda defining trend: Female narrators reign supreme\n\nLike Apple Music's Replay feature, Spotify also added listening streaks to its year-end report, showing how many days straight you tuned into a certain artist. The share button also got a makeover, showing users whether the song or album they're sending is on their top-listened-to list.\n\nHow to get Apple Music Replay\n\nAs a collective, Apple Music listeners flocked to pop princesses and diss tracks this year, awarding Sabrina Carpenter and Kendrick Lamar top slots on the charts. Taylor Swift managed a spot on the top five most streamed songs with a 5-year-old tune, up-and-comers Benson Boone and Teddy Swims made a splash with their love-drenched ballads, and country music's rising star Shaboozey earned a seat at the Replay table.\n\nThis year, iPhone users with iOS 18.1 or later can access the Replay experience directly from the music app via the Home, New, and Search tabs.

This year also includes Top 500 or Top 1000 lists for both artists and genres.\n\nApple Music also added \"streaks,\" a feature that reveals the longest number of consecutive days a user has played from Apple Music. Streaks also extend to artists if a user had an artist as their No. 1 for multiple months in a row.\n\nDate of first play, another feature offered this year, will show users when they first discovered the song, artist or album that defined their year in listening.\n\nApple Music: Beyond the year\n\nIf you want to look even further back in time, Apple Music offers an archive of a user's Replay playlists so you can rediscover your most-loved songs from years past.\n\nBeyond the personalized playlists, though, Apple Music users as a collective set larger trends for 2024. More women reached the year-end global songs chart than ever, the streamer announced in a release, and many of the top slots went to artists who had never made the year-end charts.\n\nApple Music Replay 2024 top streams\n\nPrior to Apple Music Replay's drop, the platform posted its 2024 Artist of the Year, giving the title to singer Billie Eilish.\n\nBillie Eilishis Apple Music's Artist of the Year: ''A voice of her generation'\n\nApple Music Replay: Top 5 songs (Global)\n\n\"Not Like Us\" by Kendrick Lamar \"Beautiful Things\" by Benson Boone \"Espresso\" by Sabrina Carpenter \"A Bar Song (Tipsy)\" by Shaboozey \"Cruel Summer\" by Taylor Swift\n\nApple Music Replay: Top 5 most-read lyrics\n\n\"Bling-Bang-Bang-Born\" by Creepy Nuts \"Not Like Us\" by Kenrick Lamar \"Espresso\" by Sabrina Carpenter \"Birds of a Feather\" by Billie Eilish \"Beautiful Things\" by Benson Boone\n\nApple Music Replay: Top 5 most Shazam-ed songs (Global)\n\n\"i like the way you kiss me\" by Artemis \"Beautiful Things\" by Benson Boone \"Lose Control\" by Teddy Swims \"Gotta Only\" by FloyyMenor and Cris Mj \"The Sound of Silence (CYRIL Remix)\" by Disturbed\n\n— USA TODAY contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/10/25/when-will-spotify-wrapped-2024-be-released-heres-what-to-know/75843473007/", "title": "When is Spotify Wrapped 2024 coming out?

Wrapped was the inception to do just that.\n\nWrapped has evolved in its decade of employment, following trends and offering a unique service that music competitors like Tidal and Apple Music simply cannot compete with.\n\nFrom banished to blessed:An interview with skate rock band the Black Lips\n\n\"I do feel a little left out but also it feels better knowing that I get higher audio files with Tidal than with Spotify. Tidal pays their artists more per stream too,\" said Inland Empire resident and musician Vaughn Daniel.\n\nWrapped was launched in 2015 and included only a three-tiered report: Spotify’s year in review (top lists), fans’ year in review, and artists’ year in review. The top songs feature came the next year in 2016, as did the rebranding of the name from \"Year in Music\" to \"Wrapped.\"\n\nHow to find your playlist:The wait for Apple Music Replay 2024 is over\n\nWrapped was built directly in the Spotify app in 2019, readily available on the homepage as soon as customers logged in to their profile. After this, Wrapped became more creative each year with feature videos, sounds around the world, and this year, a breakdown of listened genres per month.\n\nAccording to Rebecca Lim, Global Brand Design Director at Spotify, this year's design is the result of a tremendous collaborative effort, and Spotify is incredibly proud of the final outcome. “While we say this every year, this year’s design truly stands apart from anything we’ve done before. It’s bold, vibrant, and full of elements that are guaranteed to catch the eye.”\n\n2024 chart toppers\n\nThis year's Wrapped revealed the top artists, songs, podcasts, and most streamed albums and audiobooks on Spotify. From \"T\" Swift to Joe Rogan, the results are not so surprising for music aficionados following up-to-date pop culture trends.\n\nTaylor Swift was named Spotify's 2024 Global Top Artist. She had more than 26.6 billion streams. To award this success, Spotify has created a never-before-seen badge that will adorn her Spotify artist profile.\n\nHere are the top 10 artists globally:\n\nTaylor Swift The Weeknd Bad Bunny Drake Billie Eilish Travis Scott Peso Pluma Kanye West Ariana Grande Feid\n\nHere are the top 10 most-streamed songs globally:\n\n\"Espresso,\" Sabrina Carpenter \"Beautiful Things,\" Benson Boone \"BIRDS OF A FEATHER,\" Billie Eilish \"Gata Only,\" FloyyMenor, Cris Mj \"Lose Control,\" Teddy Swims \"End of Beginning,\" Djo \"Too Sweet,\" Hozier \"One of the Girls (with JENNIE, Lily Rose Depp),\" The Weekend \"Cruel Summer,\" Taylor Swift \"Die With A Smile,\" Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars\n\n'Grand National Tour':Get tickets for Kendrick Lamar, SZA's LA, San Francisco dates\n\nHere are the top 10 most Streamed albums globally:\n\n\"THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY,\" Taylor Swift \"HIT ME HARD AND SOFT,\" Billie Eilish \"Short n’ Sweet,\" Sabrina Carpenter \"MAÑANA SERÁ BONITO,\" Karol G \"eternal sunshine,\" Ariana Grande \"1989 (Taylor’s Version),\" Taylor Swift \"SOS,\" SZA \"Lover,\" Taylor Swift \"Fireworks & Rollerblades,\" Benson Boone \"Starboy,\" The Weeknd\n\nHere are the top 10 podcasts globally:\n\n\"The Joe Rogan Experience\" \"Call Her Daddy\" \"Huberman Lab\" \"This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von\" \"The Diary Of A CEO with Steven Bartlett\" \"Serial Killers\" \"Relatos de la Noche\" \"Crime Junkie\" \"Café Com Deus Pai | Podcast oficial\" \"El Podcast de Marian Rojas Estapé\"\n\nTop authors:Spotify Wrapped has audiobooks for first time\n\nHere are the top 10 audiobooks globally:\n\n\"A Court of Thorns and Roses\" by Sarah J.

The Year in Music campaign shared much of the same data Spotify Wrapped does, including listeners' most played songs and how many hours of music they listened to in total.\n\nThe feature got a major face-lift the following year, though, complete with the new Spotify Wrapped name. The marketing campaign has seemingly become more and more viral each year, as Spotify ups its graphic design and data personalization game.\n\nIn 2018, Spotify included data about the astrological signs of the artists a user listened to most during the year. In 2019, Spotify Wrapped adopted an Instagram Story format, allowing users to easily share (or show off) their highly-curated listening history to their social media stories. In 2020, the platform included podcast-listening data.\n\nIn last year's Spotify Wrapped, listeners were assigned a \"Sound Town\" – matching users with a city that aligned with their favorite genres and artists.\n\nOnly time will tell what new, quirky data will appear as part of users' 2024 Spotify Wrapped portfolios.\n\nDoes Apple Music have an end-of-year feature?\n\nIn 2022, Apple Music announced its version of Spotify's end-of-year campaign called Apple Music Replay. Apple's feature includes much of the same listening data as Spotify's, including a user's top songs, top albums, top artists and top genres from throughout the year.\n\nApple Music Replay functions a bit differently than Spotify Wrapped. As of this year, it began releasing monthly Replay experiences, highlighting a user's listening habits at the end of each month.\n\nApple Music users can access their Replay by locating the Listen Now tab in the app, scrolling to the Replay section, tapping the Replay ’24 playlist and then selecting the plus button in the top right. After that, Apple Music users can check out their Replay '24 throughout the year in the Playlists section of their library.\n\nSimilar to Spotify, Apple Music users will also receive a big Replay '24 roundup designed to share to social media.

You may be in for a rude awakening.\n\nSpotify Wrapped 2024 waltzed into inboxes Wednesday morning, undoubtedly carrying on its arm some hard truths. Maybe you listened to 40 hours of heartbreak pop, or a whole week's worth of Taylor Swift. Perhaps you were in the top 1% of listeners for \"Defying Gravity,\" beating out even the most ardent of theater geeks.\n\nWhatever the revelation, music streamers can delight or despair as Spotify unveils personalized data-driven reports with insights on whose music they listened to most and for how long.\n\nA capstone for the year, the release of Spotify Wrapped has become a cultural phenomenon. It offers \"a point of reflection and a reminder of the year that's gone by,\" says Sulinna Ong, Spotify's Global Head of Editorial.\n\nHere's how to access your Spotify Wrapped and what's new this year.\n\nNeed a break?

Maas\n\nWhen does Spotify Wrapped stop tracking? Does it include December?\n\nWe don't know − and that's on purpose.\n\nWhile it can be assumed that the platform does not track your December listening since it is excluded from the month-by-month report, an exact end date for data collection is not released.\n\nThat's partly because the popularity of Wrapped lies in users being delightfully surprised (or horrified) by their music choices. If a specific date were given, listeners might attempt to engineer the results, tidying up any \"cringey\" streams that might sneak their way into the data.\n\nSpotify would rather you press play on that \"Glee\" cast album with abandon, or not think twice about streaming scream-singing to \"MMmbop\" on the car ride to work.\n\nWhat’s new in Spotify Wrapped 2024?\n\nWhile some features of this year's report appear familiar, there are plenty of shiny new bells and whistles.\n\nOne such feature is \"Your Music Evolution,\" a data-driven story of the music phases you passed through over the course of the year. With up to three distinct phases, the concept feels appropriate for 2024 in which Taylor Swift broke records with her \"Eras Tour\" and changed the lexicon as laypeople began coining their own \"eras.\"\n\nIn this year's Spotify Wrappeda glaring trend: Female narrators reign supreme\n\nLike Apple Music's Replay feature, Spotify also added listening streaks to its year-end report, showing how many days straight you tuned into a certain artist. The share button also got a makeover, showing users whether the song or album they're sending is on their top-listened-to list.\n\nAI takes center stage on Spotify Wrapped\n\nSpotify entered the artificial intelligence game in 2023 with its AI DJ feature, now offered in Spanish, which curates a playlist for listeners. Now, AI DJ is integrated into Wrapped to allow premium users to search music with prompts like \"find me more artists like my top listened to.\"\n\nThis year's Wrapped also features a specialized AI podcast with a rundown on your listening habits powered by Google's Notebook LM.\n\nSpotify Wrapped stretches beyond music to podcasts, audiobooks\n\nAs the skyrocketing popularity of audiobooks blurs the lines between reading and listening, Spotify opened its Wrapped umbrella to cover the trends that dominated virtual bookshelves.\n\nThis year's report offers a rundown on the top authors and audiobooks consumed globally, plus a feature for authors themselves to see who tuned into their work (musicians and podcasters have access to the same feature).\n\nPodcasts have also become a must-have for streaming platforms, as people increasingly turn to the chatter of true crime sleuths, quasi-dating experts and cultural commentators for daily background noise.\n\n\"Podcasts are a major force in how we communicate ideas today,\" Jordan Newman, the Head of Content Partnerships at Spotify, said at a briefing. From Joe Rogan to Alex Cooper, podcast hosts have become powerful pundits, and their shows are the \"digital town squares where political discourse is happening,\" Newman says.\n\nSpotify offers a blend of video and audio, and this year's Wrapped will feature short-form videos from popular podcast hosts thanking their most loyal listeners. A \"2024 in Podcasts\" editorial hub will also appear on the app, with recommended listening for users in search of a new show.\n\nTaylor Swift namedSpotify Wrapped Global Artist of the Year for second year in a row\n\nSpotify logo gets a makeover\n\nWrapped is no small event and Spotify's iconic bright green logo is getting all dressed up for the occasion. As part of the launch, the streamer is debuting several new \"expressive\" logos that lean into punk, coquette or Western aesthetics.\n\nWhen does Spotify Wrapped come out?\n\nSpotify Wrapped was released Wednesday at 8 am ET Dec. 4.\n\nThe accompanying physical campaign hit billboards Wednesday as well, with displays specialized to cities' streaming habits across the globe.

The Defense Department has no plans to return to Afghanistan to “retrieve or destroy” the equipment, reads the report, which has been provided to Congress.\n\nThe US gave a total of $18.6 billion of equipment to the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) from 2005 to August 2021, according to the report. Of that total, equipment worth $7.12 billion remained in Afghanistan after the US withdrawal was completed on August 30, 2021. It included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment and other materials, according to the DoD report.\n\nThe huge value of the hardware left behind will serve to refocus attention on the chaotic and hasty Afghanistan withdrawal that has been heavily criticized by lawmakers from both parties.\n\n“Much of the remaining equipment” left in Afghanistan requires “specialized maintenance that DoD contractors previously provided” to Afghan forces “in the form of technical knowledge and support,” the report states.\n\nThe Department of Defense was required to submit a report to Congress “regarding the disposition of United States property, equipment and supplies provided to” Afghan forces that “were destroyed, taken out of” or “remain in Afghanistan,” states the report, which is dated March 2022.\n\n“The $7.12 billion figure cited in the Department’s recent report to Congress corresponds to ANDSF equipment and not U.S. military equipment used by our forces,” Army Major Rob Lodewick, a Defense Department spokesperson, said in a statement. “Nearly all equipment used by U.S. military forces in Afghanistan was either retrograded or destroyed prior to our withdrawal and is not part of the ‘$7.12 billion’ figure cited in the report.”\n\nFrom Afghanistan to Ukraine\n\nThe report also says that five Mi-17 helicopters that had been in Afghanistan were officially transferred to Ukraine in 2022, though they were already in Ukraine for maintenance before the US left Afghanistan. The Department of Defense notified Congress of its intent to transfer the helicopters in January 2022, before Russia’s invasion of the country had begun, and Ukraine signed a letter of acceptance on March 11, 2022.\n\n“These five helicopters were in Ukraine undergoing overhaul maintenance when the Afghan government collapsed, and have remained there since,” the report states.\n\nOf other materials the US had previously procured for Afghanistan but not sent to the country, the US has given some “non-standard munitions” to Ukraine, including about 37,000 122mm howitzer rounds, the report states.\n\nThe US has also transferred over 15 million rounds of Ball rifle ammunition, over 99,000 40mm high-explosive/fragmentation grenade cartridges, and about 119,000 82mm high-explosive mortar rounds to Ukraine from material that was previously procured for Afghanistan, the report states.\n\nThese munitions have been transferred to Ukraine under presidential drawdown authority, the report states.\n\nUS military equipment and weapons left behind\n\nAircraft worth $923.3 million remained in Afghanistan. The US left 78 aircraft procured for the government of Afghanistan at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul before the end of the withdrawal. These aircraft were demilitarized and rendered inoperable before the US military left, the report states. The US military conducted its non-combatant evacuation from Afghanistan in August, primarily through that airport.\n\nA total of 9,524 air-to-ground munitions, valued at $6.54 million, remained in Afghanistan at the conclusion of the US military withdrawal. The “significant majority” of the “remaining aircraft munitions stock are non-precision munitions,” the report states.\n\nOver 40,000 of the total 96,000 military vehicles the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US withdrawal, including 12,000 military Humvees, the report states. “The operational condition of the remaining vehicles” in Afghanistan is “unknown,” the report states.\n\nMore than 300,000 of the total 427,300 weapons the US gave to Afghan forces remained in Afghanistan at the time of the US military withdrawal, according to the report. Less than 1,537,000 of the “specialty munitions” and “common small arms ammunition,” valued at a total of $48 million, are still in the country, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” of the communications equipment that the US gave to Afghan forces, including base-station, mobile, man-portable and hand-held commercial and military radio systems, and associated transmitters and encryption devices also remained in Afghanistan at the time of the withdrawal, the report states.\n\n“Nearly all” night vision, surveillance, “biometric and positioning equipment” totaling nearly 42,000 pieces of specialized equipment remained in the country, the report adds.\n\nAnd “nearly all,” of the explosive ordinance disposal and demining equipment, including 17,500 “pieces of explosive detection, electronic countermeasure, disposal and personal protective equipment” also remained in Afghanistan, according to the report.", "authors": ["Ellie Kaufman"], "publish_date": "2022/04/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/31/europe/joseph-ratzinger-pope-benedict-xvi-obituary-intl/index.html", "title": "'God's Rottweiler': Benedict shaped Catholic doctrine but faced ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPope Emeritus Benedict XVI, whose death at 95 was announced Saturday, was a powerful intellectual force who shaped the Catholic Church’s theology for more than a quarter century before shocking the world by resigning in 2013.\n\nWhile not quite unprecedented, Benedict’s resignation was highly unusual. Popes typically hold office until death, and the last pope to step down was Gregory XII, who quit in 1415 to end a civil war within the church.\n\nBookended by globally popular and charismatic popes – St. John Paul II and Pope Francis – Benedict cut a different figure. Friends and biographers described him as quiet and scholarly, more at home among theological tomes than adoring crowds.\n\nIn typical fashion, Benedict announced his unexpected resignation in Latin. He was 85 at the time and cited his advanced age as ill-suited for the demands of running the Catholic Church.\n\nThe German-born Benedict saw himself, and the church, as a bulwark against secular trends in Western society, particularly what he called the “dictatorship of relativism.” He often insisted that Catholics maintain a fortress mentality, saying perhaps a smaller, “purer” church would best maintain Catholicism’s traditions and teachings.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict was a polarizing figure. He was hailed by conservatives who admired his erudite writings and careful theology. But critics, particularly in the postmodern West, called him “God’s Rottweiler” for his staunch insistence on fidelity to church’s doctrine and his willingness to silence dissent.\n\n“He policed the boundaries of the faith,” said David Gibson, author of “The Rule of Benedict,” a biography of the former pope. “He was brilliant and brutally effective.”\n\nBenedict also came under fire for his handling of the sexual abuse crisis that engulfed the Catholic church during his years as a senior cleric. A damning report published in January 2022 found that he knew about priests who abused children but failed to act when he was archbishop of Munich from 1977 to 1982.\n\nThe son of a policeman\n\nJoseph Ratzinger was born and raised in Bavaria, where he briefly served in the Hitler Youth, despite his objections, and the German military during World War II. His father, a policeman, loathed the Nazis, according to biographers.\n\nRatzinger, like his elder brother Georg, saw their future in the Catholic Church, entering a German seminary in 1945. Once ordained, Ratzinger rose quickly through the church, establishing himself as a leading theologian. Originally a liberal thinker, he turned conservative in 1968 in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which upended a number of Catholic teachings.\n\nIn 1977, Ratzinger was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising. Later that year, former Pope Paul VI made the German scholar a cardinal, a sign of his growing reputation within the church.\n\nFrom 1981 to 2005, Ratzinger ran the Vatican’s influential Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the office responsible for stating and policing church doctrine. He was, in effect, Catholicism’s chief theologian during this time, said Gibson, Benedict’s biographer.\n\n“His twenty-four years at the CDF were far more influential than his tenure as pope,” Gibson said.\n\nHis influence was certainly felt in the United States. In 1984, Ratzinger told the Order of Preachers, also known as the Dominicans, to investigate one of its monks, Matthew Fox, for heresy. The Vatican expelled Fox from the order in 1993.\n\nIn 1999, Ratzinger effectively silenced an American nun and priest engaged in LGBTQ ministry because they would not affirm the “Church’s teaching regarding the intrinsic evil of homosexual acts.” The nun and priest were “permanently prohibited from any pastoral work involving homosexual persons.”\n\nBut Ratzinger eventually tired of the job, reportedly asking Pope John Paul II to appoint him as a librarian at the Vatican’s library. John Paul refused.\n\n‘Please don’t do this to me’\n\nRatzinger was dean of the College of Cardinals in 2005 when he became the sixth German to be picked as pope, the first since the 11th century. At the time, the church was facing several pressing issues, including declining popularity in parts of the world and a growing crisis over its role in handling sexual abuse accusations against priests.\n\nAs the conclave to appoint Pope John Paul II’s successor went on, Ratzinger said he quickly realized that he would be elected as the new Pope – though he was reluctant to assume the mantel of St. Peter.\n\n“At a certain point, I prayed to God, ‘Please don’t do this to me,’” he told a German audience in 2005. “Evidently, this time he didn’t listen to me.”\n\nUpon his election, Ratzinger took the name Benedict XVI as a nod to church history, he said. He chose the name to honor Benedict XV, who pursued peace during World War I, and the original St. Benedict, a monk “whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe,” Ratzinger said.\n\nAt 78, he was the oldest person to have been elected pope since Pope Clement XII in 1730. Given his age, Benedict XVI was widely seen as a caretaker pope, a bridge to the next generation after the long tenure of John Paul II, a globe-trotting pontiff whose early youth and vigor gave way to such frailty in later years that he required help walking and was often hard to hear during public addresses.\n\nIn his tone, demeanor and actions, Benedict was notably different from his predecessor. Where John Paul wowed crowds around the world with his mastery of numerous languages, Benedict’s influence was felt through his erudite writings and theological rigor.\n\n“In a world which he considered relativist and secular, his main thrust was to re-establish a sense of Catholic identity for Catholics themselves,” said Delia Gallagher, CNN’s Vatican correspondent.\n\nAs Pope, Benedict often championed a back-to-basics approach. Three of his encyclicals – letters from the Pope to Catholics around the world – were based on the theological virtues of faith, hope and love.\n\nBill Donohue, of the conservative US Catholic League, credited Benedict for working to reduce friction among adherents of various faiths, something that was a key part of John Paul’s mission as well.\n\nBut critics say Benedict didn’t always choose his words wisely. During a speech in Regensburg, Germany in 2006, he quoted a 14th century Byzantine emperor who criticized Islam, calling it violent, “evil and inhuman.”\n\nHis remarks were sharply criticized by heads of states in the Middle East and Muslim groups throughout the world. Effigies of Benedict were burnt in Basra, Iraq, and elsewhere in predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nBenedict later apologized, saying he was “deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address.”\n\nCriticism over sexual abuse crisis\n\nBenedict became pope at the height of the molestation scandal involving Catholic priests, as complaints of sexual abuse and related lawsuits tore at the church and threatened its moral standing around the world.\n\nIn 2002, he asked Pope John Paul II to route all accusations of sexual abuse to his office, where he instituted changes meant to deal swiftly with accused priests. From 2004-2014, the Vatican defrocked 848 priests who raped or molested children and sanctioned another 2,572 with lesser penalties, according to the church. During that time, his office had received 3,400 accusations, according to the church.\n\nThe flood of accusations worldwide has waned at times but has never stopped.\n\nIn 2008, Benedict acknowledged “the shame which we have all felt” over abuse reports and said those responsible for the “evils” should face justice. Two years later he said abusive priests “disfigured their ministry” and brought “profound shame and regret” on the church.\n\nThat same year, 2010, he issued new rules aimed at stopping abuse. These included allowing church prosecution of suspected abusers for 20 years after the incidents occurred, up from 10 years previously. The rules also made it a church crime to download child pornography and allowed the pope to remove a priest without a formal Vatican trial.\n\nIn some cases, Benedict acted swiftly, as when he removed Marcial Maciel, a powerful Mexican priest who founded the conservative Legion of Christ, after years of allegations that he had sexually abused children.\n\n“No one did more to successfully address the problem of priestly sexual abuse than Joseph Ratzinger,” Donohue said.\n\nBut others such as the late Barbara Blaine, the former president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said the opposite was true.\n\n“I would hate for him to be remembered as someone who did the right thing because from our perspective, Pope Benedict’s record has been abysmal,” said Blaine, who died in 2017.\n\nIn 2010, The New York Times reported that church officials, including Ratzinger, had failed to act in the case of a Wisconsin priest accused of molesting up to 200 boys. The Times reported that church officials stopped proceedings against the priest after he wrote Ratzinger.\n\nAlso in 2010, the Times reported that the future pope – while serving as the archbishop in Munich – had been copied on a memo informing him that a priest accused of molesting children was being returned to pastoral work. At the time, a spokesman for the archdiocese said Ratzinger received hundreds of memos a year, and it was highly unlikely that he had read it.\n\nTwelve years later, a Church-commissioned report into abuse by Catholic clergy in the diocese found that Ratzinger had as archbishop been informed of four cases of sexual abuse involving minors – including two that had taken place while he was in office – but failed to act. In a letter published by the Vatican in February 2022, Benedict issued a general apology to survivors of abuse, writing: “Once again I can only express to all the victims of sexual abuse my profound shame, my deep sorrow and my heartfelt request for forgiveness.”\n\nOver the years, victims’ groups pressed the International Criminal Court to prosecute Benedict in the sex abuse scandal.\n\nDavid Gibson, Benedict’s biographer, said that, like many in the Vatican, the former pope was initially slow to recognize the magnitude of the church’s abuse crisis.\n\n“Like so many in the church, he was part of the learning curve,” Gibson said.\n\nThe anti-Francis\n\nUltimately, however, Benedict showed little skill or interest in governing the vast and complex world of the Catholic Church, Gibson said.\n\nIn 2012, his butler was convicted of theft for leaking confidential papal documents to fight what he saw as deep corruption within the Holy See.\n\nA year later, Benedict announced his resignation.\n\nSince then, Benedict, who chose the name Pope Emeritus and continued to wear the traditional papal white, rarely left his monastery high on a hill in Vatican City, where he promised to live a “hidden life.”\n\nStill, conservative Catholics tried to draw Benedict out, or at least use him as counterweight to the more liberal papacy of Francis. Some Catholics looked to him as an anti-Pope, or at least an anti-Francis.\n\nThe contrast between the two men was dramatized in a 2019 Netflix film, “The Two Popes,” which earned Anthony Hopkins an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Benedict.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Fessio, an American Jesuit who studied under Benedict and has published his works at Ignatius Press, said the former Pope likely knew that conservatives were trying to pit him against Francis.\n\n“In some ways, he has become the face of ‘the Resistance,’” Fessio said, “even though he hasn’t done anything to be a resistor.”\n\nBenedict preferred to be called something more modest.\n\nBefore he left Rome in 2013, a crowd of 10,000 people gathered to bid him an emotional farewell.\n\n“I am no longer the Pope but I am still in the church,” Benedict said. “I’m just a pilgrim who is starting the last part of his pilgrimage on this earth.”", "authors": ["Daniel Burke Hada Messia", "Daniel Burke", "Hada Messia"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/02/06/turkey-syria-earthquake-how-to-help-donate/11196567002/", "title": "How to help Turkey, Syria: Relief efforts ongoing after more ...", "text": "A 6.3 magnitude earthquake sent powerful shockwaves through Turkey and Syria Monday in regions still reeling from a massive 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6 that left at least 41,000 dead in Turkey and several thousands more in Syria.\n\nEarly reports from officials in the two countries confirmed injuries and further damage to already devastated buildings.

But I can understand why they thought and felt as they did,” Johnson went on. Germany has rapidly sought to reduce its reliance on Russian energy since Moscow’s invasion.\n\n“Be in no doubt that the French were in denial right up until the last moment,” Johnson also said.\n\nJohnson speaking with US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron during a June G7 summit in Germany. Pool/Getty Images\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron fronted Europe’s efforts to dissuade Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, visiting him in the Kremlin just weeks before the Russian leader ordered his troops into the country. In March, the chief of French military intelligence, Gen. Eric Vidaud, was told to step down from his post partly for “failing to anticipate” the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a military source with knowledge of the matter told CNN at the time.\n\nJohnson also criticized Italy’s initial response to the threat of an invasion. He told Quest that its government – at the time led by Mario Draghi – was “at one stage simply saying that they would be unable to support the position we were taking,” given their “massive” reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.\n\nCNN has reached out to the French and German governments. Draghi’s office declined to comment.\n\nOn Wednesday Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, shared a comment on Twitter that he attributed to a government spokesperson: “We know that the very entertaining former Prime Minister always has a unique relationship with the truth. This case is also no exception.”\n\nMany observers initially believed a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be completed within weeks or days, but Kyiv’s forces instead repelled Moscow’s initial lunge towards the capital and have more recently conducted successful counter-offensives to regain ground in the east and south of the country.\n\nJohnson said that once Russia launched its invasion in February, attitudes across Europe changed quickly.\n\n“What happened was everybody – Germans, French, Italians, everybody, (US President) Joe Biden – saw that there was simply no option. Because you couldn’t negotiate with this guy (Putin). That’s the key point,” the ex-Prime Minister said, adding that the “the EU has done brilliantly” in its opposition of Russia since that time.\n\nJohnson during an August visit to Ukraine, alongside Volodymyr Zelensky. from 10 Downing Street\n\n“After all my anxieties … I pay tribute to the way the EU has acted. They have been united. The sanctions were tough,” Johnson went on.\n\nDuring his period in office, Johnson frequently criticized Russia’s invasion and forged a close relationship with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Johnson was forced to resign in July after repeated scandals sank his reputation and caused dozens of his ministers to resign.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Boris Johnson talks about his chances of becoming prime minister again 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson told CNN that Zelensky has been “absolutely outstanding” in his leadership. “He’s a very brave guy. I think the history of this conflict would have been totally, totally different it he hadn’t been there.”\n\nHe added that “if Ukraine chooses to be a member of the EU, they should go for it. and I think it would be a good thing for Ukraine,” helping it achieve political and economic reform. Kyiv applied to join the bloc earlier this year.\n\nJohnson was replaced in Downing Street by Liz Truss, who had the shortest tenure of any British Prime Minister. Her disastrous seven-week term was sunk by a “mini-budget” that spooked markets and caused global financial agencies to express alarm.\n\nIn a euphemistic criticism of that mini-budget, Johnson told Quest: “It’s kind of like when I play the piano. The notes individually sound perfectly OK, but they’re not in the right order, or occurring at the right time.”\n\nTruss has since been replaced by Johnson’s Chancellor-turned-political rival, Rishi Sunak, who visited Kyiv for the first time as Prime Minister on Saturday.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/middleeast/iran-protesters-repression-investigation-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Stalked, tortured, disappeared: Iranian authorities have a playbook ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nArman doesn’t sleep much anymore.\n\n“In my nightmare, I see someone is following me in the dark, ” he said. “I’m alone and no one is helping me.”\n\nHe says his life was forever altered in early October, when he was arrested on the streets of Tehran for joining anti-government demonstrations, and then tortured by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) – known as the Sepah – for four days.\n\nThe abuse was psychological and physical, he told CNN, including electric shocks, controlled drowning and mock executions.\n\nThe 29-year-old says he was held in solitary confinement and intermittently beaten, before eventually being placed in a room with roughly two dozen other protesters, including a woman with cuts across her face and neck who said she had been sexually assaulted by security forces.\n\nArman, whose name has been changed for his safety, says he saw the IRGC’s emblem on a desk, and again on the uniform of one of the men guarding him – but that he doesn’t know exactly where in Tehran the center was located because he was tasered and had lost consciousness before being driven there.\n\nIn order to leave the detention center, Arman claims he was forced to sign a false confession saying he received money from the US, UK and Israeli governments to go out and create “chaos” in Iranian society. He was then told that if he engaged in any more “activism” he and his family would be hunted down and arrested, he said.\n\nWhat Arman claims happened to him and those allegedly detained alongside him isn’t an isolated incident. Instead, it’s part of a tried and tested playbook used by the Iranian government to stalk, torture and imprison protesters, in an ongoing campaign to squash political dissent.\n\nArman, whose name has been changed for his safety, says he was tasered before being detained. Arman\n\nIn the months following Iran’s nationwide demonstrations in 2019, which were sparked by the government’s abrupt decision to increase the price of gas by 50% but snowballed into calls for the fall of the Islamic Republic and its leaders, widespread accounts of torture and thousands of arrests were documented.\n\nAs Iranians from all walks of life unite to fight for their civil rights – in protests first sparked by the death of a young woman in religious police custody last month – it appears to be happening again.\n\n“We are now in the worst time of our life. Full of stress. Full of fear,” a 24-year-old female protester told CNN. She says several of her friends were tortured – and that one of them was also sexually violated – after being detained by the IRGC in Rasht last month.\n\n“Nothing has happened to me yet and I was able to escape. But it is possible at any moment,” she explained during a video call about the incident, her face covered to protect her identity.\n\nCNN has spoken to almost a dozen Iranians who have shared first-hand accounts of torture in either the 2019 and 2022 protests, or who have had loved ones die or disappear while in the custody of authorities.\n\nSome of those impacted shared photographs documenting their injuries as well as court records detailing the criminal charges they’re facing; others shared only their stories, which CNN cannot independently verify.\n\nCNN contacted the Iranian government as well as its permanent mission to the United Nations regarding the accounts of torture and arbitrary detention detailed by protesters but has yet to receive a response.\n\nA group of people look out from what appears to be a security van in Tehran, as an officer stands nearby. Twitter\n\n‘There were rapes, torture’\n\nFarhad, a 37-year-old father-of-two, intimately understands the personal cost of speaking out against the Iranian government, but it hasn’t stopped him from joining the demonstrations which have continued for more than a month now and seem to transcend Iran’s social and ethnic divisions.\n\nIn the November 2019 protests, he says he watched several of his friends die on the streets of Tehran after being gunned down by security forces, in what would be a four-day nationwide rampage to silence dissent that ultimately left more than 300 civilians dead, according to Amnesty International.\n\nIt wasn’t until December 2, in the aftermath of the bloodshed, that Farhad says plain-clothes officers kicked down his door in the middle of the night to arrest him for his involvement in the demonstrations.\n\nFarhad, whose name has also been changed for his security, says the IRGC used footage of the protests from the BBC – which he has since shared with CNN – to identify him, effectively weaponizing the media coverage of the rallies to hunt down participants.\n\nIranian police patrol in the capital Tehran on October 8, 2022. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe claims he was tortured for 16 days in total and like Arman, that he knew the Tehran detention center in which he was being held was run by the IRGC because of a sign on one of its walls displaying its distinctive insignia.\n\nIn Farhad’s telling, several hundred people were detained and tortured alongside him. He still hears their screams.\n\n“Hundreds of people were imprisoned with me. There was a bed, people were being tied to it and abused. There were rapes, torture with electric shocks and boiling water … they were hanging people from the ceiling to beat them,” he told CNN.\n\nFarhad’s last memory from his time in that dark room is when he was hung up and beaten senseless by plain-clothes officers before being thrown in the back of a car, driven to an undisclosed location and dumped on the side of the road.\n\nDays later he woke up in a medical clinic near his house in Tehran, he said. He doesn’t know how he got there but cites an extended family member with links to Iran’s government as a possible reason his life was spared.\n\n“My teeth were broken; my lip was completely torn off. Because my bleeding was so severe, I [think] they did not expect me to survive.”\n\nCNN has reviewed photographs of Farhad’s injuries and the scarring he lives with today.\n\nFarjad has since left Tehran with his immediate family for their safety, but says he still receives late-night phone calls from Iranian authorities threatening to rape his wife and kill his children, and that his bank account is periodically frozen.\n\nHe also claims that in the months following his torture, his national identity card – the primary document used to access essential services in Iran – was wiped from the system.\n\nDespite the ongoing risks to his life and livelihood, Farhad’s commitment to the current demonstrations is unwavering.\n\n“My country and my people are suffering. The government of the Islamic Republic oppresses in the name of religion, I can’t see people [being] killed for their beliefs anymore,” he said.\n\nCNN spoke with four more protesters who were tortured while in detention and later imprisoned for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in 2019 – including a young single mother who says she has had to place her son in the care of her parents in order to serve prison time, and a 43-year-old father of two from Shiraz who says he suffers from acute post-traumatic stress disorder, after spending 48 days in solitary confinement.\n\nTheir accounts all share striking similarities, most notably the ongoing harassment they say their families face from Iranian authorities via fake social media accounts, late-night phone calls, and local informants whom they believe monitor them for the IRGC intelligence service.\n\nAmin Sabeti is an Iranian cyber security expert who has spent years studying hacking groups with ties to the Islamic Republic, including the IRGC-affiliated ‘Charming Kitten’ group, which was recently sanctioned by the US government for “malicious cyber-enabled activities, including ransomware and cyber-espionage.”\n\nAccording to Sabeti, who is based in the UK, state-sponsored hackers have a tried and tested method in place to “dox protesters” once they’ve infiltrated their online groups using fake accounts, which involves “sharing photos of them on Twitter, Instagram or Telegram and asking others to share information about them,” while pretending to be concerned for their safety.\n\n“They used the same tactics in the November 2019 uprising,” Sabeti explained, which has led to more tech-savvy demonstrators identifying suspicious accounts and distributing warnings among their networks.\n\nA history of torture\n\nAt Tehran’s Ebrat Museum – a repurposed former prison – dramatic displays on the atrocities carried out against Muslim clerics by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s police during the revolution have long been used as a propaganda tool to celebrate the “freedoms” won in the Islamic Republic.\n\nAnd yet, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – who was himself imprisoned in the 1970s during Pahlavi’s reign – and his security apparatus, have a decades-long legacy of also using mass arrests and torture to control and silence political dissidents – the hypocrisy of which is not lost on protesters today.\n\nThe current movement – led and inspired by women – has united Iranians across generations, in what is shaping up to be the biggest threat the regime has faced to date. Notably, it has also survived weeks of rolling internet outages and violent crackdowns.\n\nBut as chants of “woman, life, freedom” continue – a rallying cry that’s come to encompass the daily violence and control Iranian women are rising up against – more than 1,000 people have been arrested, according to state news IRNA.\n\nPeople gather next to a burning motorcycle in Tehran amid the protests on October 8. Stringer/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nLooking ahead, analysts and exiled activists CNN spoke to are fearful that the authorities will ultimately employ whatever violent tactics they deem necessary to once again, regain some semblance of control.\n\nAlready, almost two dozen children – some as young as 11 – were killed by Iran’s security forces during demonstrations in September, according to Amnesty International, in a chilling reminder that no life will be spared. Meanwhile, Iran’s Education Minister Yousef Nouri confirmed last week that student protesters are now being detained in what he termed “psychological institutions,” run by the state.\n\nNone of the Iranians CNN spoke with were naive to the fact that their lives – and the lives of their families – are on the line as the uprising rages on, with most going to extreme lengths to protect their personal information online and avoid unnecessary risks while taking to the streets.\n\nArman still receives threatening phone calls and messages for his activism, but he says he won’t be deterred.\n\n“They torture us, and they are lying to the world, to the international community … Iranians want freedom,” he said. “We don’t want dictatorship. We want to connect with the world.”", "authors": ["Hannah Ritchie Teele Rebane", "Hannah Ritchie", "Teele Rebane"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}]}

PepsiCo (PEP)’s share price also hit an all-time high Friday.\n\nAnother way to hold onto customers while raising prices is to focus on value.\n\n“Consumers are willing to tolerate” price increases because they still see McDonald’s as an affordable brand, noted CEO Chris Kempczinski during an analyst call discussing third-quarter results Thursday.\n\nIn fact, McDonald’s has been increasing its share “among low-income consumers,” said CFO Ian Borden during the call.\n\nMcDonald’s is “positioned as the leading brand in terms of value for money and affordability,” said Borden, noting that some customers are shifting from buying meals to purchasing value items as a way to save.

They have publicly said that they will not allow this. But we will take our revenge from the Zionists.”\n\nWhile Israeli media has all but confirmed that Mossad was behind the strike, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu remained vague when asked by reporters about his country’s involvement.\n\n“Iran has never given up its quest for nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them,” he said, adding: “I will never allow Iran to obtain the nuclear capability to carry out its genocidal goal of eliminating Israel.”\n\nThe attack on the Natanz site is by no means the first. More than a decade ago, “a joint Israeli-American cyberattack” on the facility was carried out in a bid to “slow Tehran’s progress toward nuclear weapons”, says the NYT.\n\nThe White House has denied any links to Sunday’s blackout, however. Spokesperson Jen Psaki told a press briefing that “the US was not involved in any manner”.\n\nNuclear friction\n\nThe attack comes amid ongoing talks between US and Iranian officials in Vienna about reviving the Iran nuclear deal. Representatives of the two countries are not meeting in person, with EU officials instead facilitating the negotiations, scheduled to last for ten days.\n\nLawmakers in Tehran have called on Foreign Minister Zarif to suspend the talks, arguing that “Iran should not be engaged in negotiations when it is under attack”, the NYT says.\n\n“Talks under pressure have no meaning,” Abbas Moghtadaie, deputy chair of Iran’s National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said during a talk on the Clubhouse social media app on Monday. “This was a message we conveyed very clearly today.”\n\nMeanwhile, Israel remains concerned that Iran could one day manufacture an atomic bomb, with Middle East correspondent Campbell MacDiarmid writing that “analysts suggested that the timing was not coincidental”.\n\nRather than aiming to “derail the talks”, the move is being interpreted as a sign that Israel is “willing to act independently to advance its interests”, MacDiarmid says. “The Natanz incident was the second apparent attack on Iranian interests since indirect talks over the nuclear deal started last week.”\n\nZarif’s pledge to take revenge against Israel “highlighted the risk of escalation in a years-long shadow war between Iran and Israel”, the NYT says.\n\nThe Natanz site is not far from the area where Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the scientists who American intelligence officials believe was behind Iran’s secret nuclear programme, was killed in December by a remote-controlled gun. Like the security failure that resulted in Fakhrizadeh’s death, “the attack this weekend was another humiliating indication that [Iran’s] programme has been penetrated by spies and saboteurs”, the paper adds.\n\n“These incidents were timed and tied to the nuclear deal talks and Iran’s nuclear day events but that’s just tradecraft from the Israelis,” Joel Gulhane, Middle East and North Africa analyst at The Risk Advisory Group, told The Telegraph.\n\n“As Netanyahu said, Israel’s strategic aims with regards to Iran’s nuclear programme are not bound by the nuclear deal,” Gulhane added. “Israel is demonstrating what it can do to Iran's nuclear programme if it needs to.”", "authors": ["Joe Evans", "Last Updated", "Theara Coleman", "The Week Us", "The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Richard Windsor", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2021/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/19/global-outage-communications-systems/74465953007/", "title": "Global Microsoft outage latest news: Updates on major IT crash", "text": "A defective update from U.S. cybersecurity software company CrowdStrike crashed Microsoft Windows systems around the globe Friday. The tech outage disrupted operations across industries such as banks, hospitals and 911 call centers, plus grounded flights and hampered public transit systems and. Although a fix was deployed to restore most systems by the afternoon to return to normal, ripple effects may be felt throughout the weekend, experts warn.\n\nCrowdStrike, which advertises being used by over half of Fortune 500 companies, said one of its recent content updates had a defect that impacted Microsoft's Windows Operating System, adding the incident was \"not a security incident or cyberattack.\"\n\n\"Earlier today, a CrowdStrike update was responsible for bringing down a number of IT systems globally,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement on Friday afternoon. \"We are actively supporting customers to assist in their recovery.\"\n\nThe company's CEO, George Kurtz, apologized for the disruptions in a post on X, noting the issue has been identified and isolated and a fix has been deployed. CrowdStrike is \"working with all impacted customers to ensure that systems are back up and they can deliver the services their customers are counting on.\" Meanwhile, Microsoft said, \"the underlying cause has been fixed\" and impacted Microsoft 365 apps and services have been recovered, though the company continues to monitor the issue.\n\nKurtz went on to warn in his statement, \"We know that adversaries and bad actors will try to exploit events like this. I encourage everyone to remain vigilant and ensure that you’re engaging with official CrowdStrike representatives.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nIn the U.S., thousands of flights were canceled Friday morning. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines were among those who grounded flights less than an hour after Microsoft said it resolved a cloud-services-related outage that impacted several low-cost carriers.\n\n“Every line is long,” said Chance Ortego, 31, whose flight to New York was canceled Friday morning.\n\nPublic transit systems in the U.S. also reported temporary impacts, but for the most part, trains and buses were running as scheduled. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in Washington, D.C., said its \"website and some of our internal systems are currently down,\" but trip-planning applications were later restored. In New York City, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority also said some of its MTA customer information systems were temporarily offline until around 5:30 p.m.\n\nAround the world, the outages disrupted London's Stock Exchange, caused major train delays in the U.K., sent British broadcaster Sky News off air, forced medical facilities in Europe and the U.S. to cancel some services and caused disruptions at airports in Europe, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.\n\nWidespread economic impact from the outage is expected to be small, even though many companies were still trying to resume full operations by the time the stock market closed.\n\nTravel disruptions:Over 2,000 US flights canceled amid global IT outage\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ More than 5,000 flights were canceled globally as of 3:30 p.m. Eastern, about 4.6% of all scheduled commercial flights for the day, according to aviation analytics company Cirium.\n\n◾ Some U.S. border crossings saw impacts amid the outage: Traffic stalled on the Ambassador Bridge, which connects Detroit with Windsor, Ontario, Canada, as well as at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, the Detroit Free Press reported. CBP One, the Customs and Border Patrol app, and the agency’s border wait times website, each appeared to experience outages.\n\n◾ U.S. stocks closed lower on Friday, in the wake of the outage. CrowdStrike shares closed down 11.1% at $304.96, with analysts predicting the outage would cost the company money to fix and restore trust with its customers. It was the lowest close for the shares since May 2. Microsoft shares fared better, closing down only 0.74% at $437.11.\n\n◾ Krispy Kreme gave away free doughnuts Friday due to the global tech outage.\n\n◾ Some Starbucks locations were reportedly taking only cash Friday, and customers reported being unable to use the coffee chain's mobile app.\n\n◾ Some had a sense of humor through it, with workers who had to muddle through expressing their wishes for a digital snow day from the office − \"Knock Teams out\" − as the outage didn't equate to a work stoppage for all.\n\n◾ Dubai International Airport said on X it was operating normally following \"a global system outage that affected the check-in process for some airlines.\" It added the affected airlines \"promptly switched to an alternate system, allowing normal check-in operations to resume swiftly.\"\n\nCrowdStrike impact:How a global IT outage unraveled the world's tech\n\nHow the CrowdStrike outage played out throughout the day:\n\nPortland issues emergency declaration\n\nPortland, Oregon, Mayor Ted Wheeler issued an emergency declaration Friday over the tech outage, with a statement noting the outages are affecting city servers, employee computers and emergency communications.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maryland Department of Emergency Management increased its state activation level from \"normal\" to \"partial,\" citing the tech outage. A post on X says a \"partial\" activation is for incidents that require \"significant monitoring or resources,\" with additional emergency operations staffing from other agencies, functions and supporting organizations.\n\n- Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat is CrowdStrike?\n\nCrowdStrike is a popular cybersecurity software company created in 2012 by CEO George Kurtz, along with Dmitri Alperovitch, and Gregg Marston.\n\nAccording to its website, CrowdStrike has the \"world's most advanced cloud-native platform that protects and enables the people, processes and technologies that drive modern enterprise.\"\n\nAlperovitch, CrowdStrike's former Chief Technology Officer, is a member of the Biden administration's Homeland Security Advisory Council, which is meant to provide advice and expertise to support decision-making \"across the spectrum of homeland security operations.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\nWhat caused the CrowdStrike outage?\n\nAccording to an alert sent by CrowdStrike to its clients and reviewed by Reuters, the company's \"Falcon Sensor\" software caused Microsoft Windows to crash and display a blue screen, known informally as the \"Blue Screen of Death.\"\n\nKurtz said \"there was an issue with a Falcon content update for Windows Hosts\" but customers “remain fully protected,” according to a post on X. He also reiterated that Friday's outage \"was not a security or cyber incident.\"\n\nAnne Neuberger, deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology, said she spoke to Kurtz Friday and confirmed the incident did not appear to be related to a cyber attack.\n\n“At this point, we believe that it is an IT-related patch, an issue with that patch,” she said while speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. \"I think they're determining what went wrong there.\"\n\n-Gabe Hauari, Bailey Schulz\n\n‘I’m just hoping to make it onto a flight’\n\nChance Ortego had reached the finish line of a nearly two-week work trip when he saw the news all air travelers dread: his flight was delayed.\n\nOrtego was in the AirTrain en route to his flight from San Francisco International Airport when he heard other travelers discussing the outage. After checking the status of his 7:05 a.m. Delta Air Lines flight to New York – which was pushed back nearly three hours – he rebooked another flight at 9:15 a.m.\n\nHe later learned his original flight had been canceled. Ortego was among the thousands of passengers around the world facing delays, cancellations and problems checking in as airports and airlines were caught up in a massive IT outage that grounded U.S. flights early Friday.\n\n“I was already planning to sleep,” said Ortego, who works in health care. “Now I'm just hoping to make it onto a flight.”\n\nInside the airport, there was more chaos than a typical travel day as airlines recovered from the outage. Many screens were blank except for an error message and airport personnel made announcements directing questions about flights to airlines.\n\nAll U.S. airlines issued travel waivers for those affected to easily rebook their plans. Those who opted to cancel can rest easy knowing the Department of Transportation classified the cancellations and delays as controllable, thus airlines are responsible for upholding the commitments they've made to customers when it comes to policies like rebooking or hotel and meal vouchers as the mess gets sorted out.\n\n- Nathan Diller\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nThe outage isn’t expected to have any effect on the broader economy unless it persists for days.\n\n“At this point, the IT outage is more a nuisance than an economic event,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “If it drags on into early next week, the economic damage will begin to mount.”\n\nIf the outage is limited to a day or two, canceled flights can be rebooked and banking transactions can be completed later.\n\n“There is plenty of time for activity to be recovered over the remainder of the month,” says Jonathan Miller, senior U.S. economist at Barclays.\n\n- Paul Davidson\n\nOutage impacts US public transit websites, ticketing\n\nMajor cities were generally able to keep trains and busses running, but tech issues have been causing problems with ticketing and other tech systems, leading to delays in some cases.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported website and other tech issues, but said trains and buses were running as scheduled.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City reported problems with \"customer information systems\" but said it's buses and trains were unaffected. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was not affected but urged riders who might be using public transit to any area airports to check with their airlines before traveling for updates.\n\nNew Jersey Transit said some of its ticketing machines may have been impacted but its buses and trains were, for the most part, running on time. Some trains were out of operation Friday due to repairs that had to be made because of the intense heat that blanketed the region all week.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported Friday morning that commuter rail lines were affected, though it noted traffic is typically lighter on Fridays than other days. Delays on some lines were as long as 45 minutes, the Tribune reported. Chicago Transit bus and rail service was not affected but some CTA customers were unable to add value to their payment cards via the app or machines overnight, but the issue has been resolved.\n\nSome transit systems, including Metro Transit in Minneapolis and Cincinnati Metro reported temporary disruptions to websites, trip planners, social media and other applications but no impact to its bus or trains.\n\n- Phaedra Trethan\n\nDespite summer break, schools disrupted by IT issues\n\nThe CrowdStrike outage crashed some computers at colleges Friday and hampered a popular software for enrolling students in K-12 schools for the fall.\n\nThe University of Rochester, a private school in New York, told students to keep rebooting their systems until the problem was fixed. The University of Alabama’s technology office said its campus computers using Microsoft Windows crashed. Rutgers University and the University of Kentucky also reported disruptions.\n\nDespite the summer break, K-12 schools in Maryland and Kansas said they were having problems with PowerSchool, a widely used software for grading and student enrollment. An update posted to the company’s webpage Friday morning said the outage was impacting all its major products, including its enrollment feature.\n\n- Zachary Schermele\n\n911 call centers disrupted\n\nState and local law enforcement agencies across the country reported disruptions to 911 services after the outage hit.\n\nNational reports of 911 outages peaked at more than 100 on Friday just before 3 a.m. according to Downdetector.\n\nAgencies in at least seven states reported temporary outages, including the St. Louis County Sheriff's Office and Faribault Police Department in Minnesota, 911 systems New Hampshire, Fulton County, Indiana, and Middletown, Ohio.\n\nNon-emergency and 911 calls to multiple dispatch centers in Alaska \"were not able to be answered\" for around seven hours overnight, Austin McDaniel, communications director for the Alaska Department of Public Safety, told USA TODAY in an email.\n\n\"Dispatch centers switched to analog phone systems or to partner dispatch centers that were not impacted to continue taking calls,\" he wrote. Systems in the state were back up as of 4:23 a.m. local time.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department was also impacted ‒ 911 call centers could take calls, but had to dispatch officers manually, the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in an email to USA TODAY that it was aware of reports of disruptions to 911.\n\n\"We’re closely working with other federal agencies to provide assistance and determine the extent of these service disruptions.”\n\n- Cybele Mayes-Osterman\n\nBiden briefed on global outage as federal agencies assess impacts\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the CrowdStrike outage and his team is in touch with the cybersecurity firm, as well as with impacted companies and agencies, according to the White House. Biden will receive \"sector-by-sector updates throughout the day and is standing by to provide assistance as needed,\" the White House added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement it is working to \"fully assess and address system outages.\"\n\nDHS added it's working alongside the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as well as CrowdStrike, Microsoft and federal, state, local and critical infrastructure partners to get a grasp on the incident and its impacts.\n\nOver 2K US flights canceled amid outage\n\nSeveral U.S. carriers, including American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, issued ground stops for all their flights early on Friday due to communication problems, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe FAA said operations were no longer impacted as of 10:53 a.m. ET, but it continues to monitor the situation and warned the global IT issue could continue to affect flights this weekend.\n\nThere were more than 2,500 U.S. flights canceled and more than 7,900 delays as of 3:25 p.m. EDT, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.\n\nMost airlines were able to resume operations as the morning progressed, but many said they expected disruptions to continue throughout the day.\n\nRead more about the outage's travel impacts\n\nHospitals cancel nonemergency services\n\nHospitals across the U.S. and overseas were impacted by the outage, which forced some to cancel elective surgeries and halt visitations as well as outpatient services.\n\nMass General Brigham in Boston canceled previously scheduled nonurgent surgeries, procedures and medical visits, according to a statement sent to USA TODAY. In the same area, Tufts Medical Center told media outlet WHDH it’s still assessing the outage’s effect on clinical and surgical operations.\n\nIn Texas, Ben Taub Hospital and Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital suspended \"hospital visitation and patient information,\" citing a \"Microsoft Windows failure,\" according to a statement from Harris Health System. Cincinnati Children's Hospital said many of its Microsoft-based computer systems are down because of the outage, which forced the hospital to cancel early morning appointments.\n\n\"We are in touch with the hospital field and the federal government and monitoring the situation closely to better understand its scope and impact,\" said John Riggi, the American Hospital Association's national adviser for cybersecurity and risk.\n\nTwo hospitals in northern German cities canceled elective operations scheduled for Friday but continued to provide patient care and emergency services.\n\nOutages exposes fragility of internet infrastructure\n\nWhile there were reports of companies gradually restoring their services, analysts weighed the potential of what one called the biggest-ever outage in the industry and the broader economy.\n\n\"This is a very, very uncomfortable illustration of the fragility of the world’s core Internet infrastructure,\" Ciaran Martin, Professor at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government and former head of the U.K. National Cyber Security Centre, told Reuters.\n\n\"IT security tools are all designed to ensure that companies can continue to operate in the worst-case scenario of a data breach, so to be the root cause of a global IT outage is an unmitigated disaster,\" said Ajay Unni, CEO of StickmanCyber, one of Australia's largest cybersecurity services companies.\n\n– Reuters\n\nOutages ripple far and wide\n\nFrom the United Kingdom to Singapore, the effects of tech outages were far-reaching on Friday.\n\nBritish broadcaster Sky News went off-air and train companies in the U.K. reported long delays. Departure boards at several U.K. airports appeared to freeze, according to passengers who posted reports on social media.\n\nLondon's Stock Exchange reported experiencing disruptions. Some hospitals also reported difficulties processing appointments and several chain retail stores said they couldn't take payments. The soccer club Manchester United said on X that it had to postpone a scheduled release of tickets.\n\nIn Australia, media, banks and telecoms companies suffered outages.\n\nThere was no information to suggest the outage was a cybersecurity incident, the office of Australia's National Cyber Security Coordinator Michelle McGuinness said in a post on X.\n\nNew York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority said some of its systems were offline due to a worldwide technical outage, but have since been restored. It said MTA train and bus services were unaffected.\n\nSpanish authorities reported a \"computer incident\" at all its airports.\n\nBerlin's main airport said check-ins were delayed because of a \"technical fault.\"\n\nRyanair, Europe’s largest airline by passenger numbers, warned passengers of potential disruptions which it said would affect \"all airlines operating across the Network.\" It did not specify the nature of the disruptions.\n\nThere were reports a shipping terminal in Gdansk on Poland's Baltic coast was not operating normally.\n\nNetBlocks, a digital-connectivity watchdog, said that the outage reported by global airlines, corporates and infrastructure services firms and others was having \"minimal\" impact on global Internet connectivity.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/middleeast/saudi-iran-media-protests-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "London-based TV channel sparks Iranian leaders' ire amid protests ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA top Iranian military official issued a warning to Saudi Arabia last week as his government continued to face off against protesters at home. “You are involved in this matter and know that you are vulnerable, it is better to be careful,” he said at the sidelines of a military drill.\n\nMajor General Hossein Salami, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was referring to what state news outlets called a “media war” that they say is being waged against “the Iranian youth and nation” by foreign conspirators seeking to create unrest in the country by supporting protesters there.\n\nThen, on Thursday Iran again warned Saudi Arabia, as well as the United States and the United Kingdom, to “stop interfering in the country’s internal affairs.”\n\nIran last week said it sanctioned a number of media outlets in the UK for “supporting terrorism” and “inciting violence”, reported Tasnim news agency The sanctioned entities include, among others, Volant Media, Global Media, and DMA Media, as well as the “anti-Iranian TV channels” that the companies support, such as Iran International, reported Tasnim agency.\n\nNow in their sixth week, protests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nAs the protests rage, Iran is turning up the heat on its adversaries, mainly the United States and Israel. But last week, Saudi Arabia found itself in the line of fire, which risks further complicating attempts by the two regional rivals to mend ties.\n\nRiyadh hasn’t publicly commented on the protests. The kingdom’s foreign minister refused to give his view when asked to during an interview with Al Arabiya news channel on October 12.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has a fixed policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of states,” he said. “Surely, we are following [the situation] and we wish Iran and its people the best.”\n\nIran and Saudi Arabia severed ties in 2016 and both parties have backed opposite sides in proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Last year, they began direct talks in an attempt to improve relations. Baghdad has hosted five rounds of talks so far, the last of which was held in April.\n\nAt the heart of Iran’s most recent accusations against Saudi Arabia may be Iran International, a Persian-language news channel that broadcasts from London. The channel has become one of the go-to sources for many Persian speakers looking for news on the protests. It has been at the forefront of covering the demonstrations, getting breaking news and exclusive footage of the events on the ground. Its Twitter account has over a million followers.\n\nFounded in 2017, Iran International has previously come under scrutiny by the Iranian government. Some say it is due to their coverage of the protests at home, which in recent weeks have rocked the Islamic Republic.\n\nSalami didn’t name the channel in his warning, but government-backed Iranian media last week accused Saudi Arabia of funding it. Saudi Arabia has not addressed the allegations. Karim Sa djadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington DC, said on Twitter that Iran has demanded the shuttering of the channel in talks with Saudi Arabia, citing a senior Gulf official.\n\nIn 2018, Iran International released a statement denying connections to any government, including Saudi Arabia or Iran after The Guardian reported that it was funded by a firm whose director has ties to Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia did not comment on the Guardian report. The Saudi government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\n“We have heard these accusations before most often promoted by those in whose interests it is to deny a free press,” a spokesperson for Volant Media told CNN.\n\n“Iran International and its sister channel, Afghanistan International, are editorially independent television channels owned by Volant Media, a company based in London owned by a Saudi Arabian/British citizen; it has no state backing or affiliation,” added the spokesperson.\n\nAzadeh Moaveni, associate professor of journalism at New York University, described the channel as “one of the most pernicious and damaging forces to enter the Iranian media sphere,” calling it an arm of Saudi foreign policy. “I would not describe Iran International as pro-reform, or organically Iranian in any manner,” she told CNN.\n\nMohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran who was also an adviser to the Iranian nuclear talks negotiating team, said there’s “no doubt” that Iran International is funded by Saudi Arabia. A prominent figure on state-funded Iranian outlets, Marandi added that Iran International spreads rumors, ethnic and sectarian strife “and it tries to use misinformation to create fear, chaos and promote violence.”\n\nSaudi Research and Marketing Group, a media conglomerate with ties to the Saudi ruling family, has run the Persian language website of the UK’s Independent newspaper since 2018. Its account on Instagram, where many Iranians get their news, has over 600,000 followers.\n\nCNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which has a partnership with Saudi Research and Media Group, a Saudi joint stock company.\n\nSaudi Arabia has for years accused Iran of doing the same with its own Arabic-language news channels: targeting Arab audiences with propaganda. State-run Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting runs Al Alam TV, an Arabic news channel that has interviewed Saudi opposition figures and has been blocked by Arab states. Iran-backed Hezbollah’s Al Manar channel has also been blocked.\n\n“It’s about time Iran gets a taste of its own medicine,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst. “Iran has spent decades inciting and funding instability in the Arab world so having them pay the price of such behavior themselves is certainly a source of satisfaction to a lot of people,” he told CNN.\n\nThe channel “is making an impact on public behavior in Iran and they are nervous about their domestic situation,” added Shihabi.\n\nAnalysts say that Iran’s tight grip on domestic media outlets and its lack of freedom of expression have created “fertile ground” for anti-establishment platforms such as Iran International to flourish.\n\n“It is not so much the broadcasters themselves, but the situation in Iran has provided the possibility for broadcasters outside of Iran to gather a certain degree of popularity in the Iranian context,” said Gholam Khiabany, a reader in media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n\nHarun Najafizada, a former journalist at Iran International who is now a director at the sister Afghanistan International news channel, said the parent company Volant Media is privately funded but “I don’t care as long as they do not influence my editorial take,” adding that shareholders never interfere in decision making.\n\nIran International stood out from other Western-backed Persian language news outlets “by taking the side of the disenchanted, oppressed, voiceless people,” while competitor Persian channels in the West were focused on bringing balance by giving the Iranian government a voice, he told CNN.\n\n“They have a vision, of course – they don’t do it for God,” said Najafizada, referring to the shareholders. “That vision is democracy.”\n\nJust two days after Salami’s first warning, however, Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, was quoted saying that the two countries should reopen their embassies to facilitate a rapprochement, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency ISNA.\n\n“We are neighbors of Saudi Arabia and we must coexist,” he was cited as saying by ISNA. “The embassies of the two countries should reopen in order to solve our problems in a better way.”\n\nIran protests\n\nBusiness owners and factory workers in Iran’s Kurdish region went on strike over the weekend as anti-government protests continued.\n\nVideo shared with CNN by pro-reform activist outlet IranWire shows Sanandaj, the capital of the Kurdish region, quiet at the beginning of the work week as stores remain shut.\n\nThe Norway-based Iranian rights group Hengaw said shopkeepers were on strike in Bukan, Sanandaj and Saqez, as well as Marivan. Strikes and protests have become common in cities and towns across Iran as people unite against the regime.\n\nThe nationwide protests are now in their fifth week, triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died three days after being arrested by the country’s morality police and taken to a re-education center.\n\nHere’s the latest on this developing story:\n\nIran will file a lawsuit against the United States claiming the US had direct involvement in recent riots, Kazem Gharibabadi, the deputy head of the Iranian judiciary and secretary of the country’s High Council for Human Rights, said on Saturday, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nThe Coordinating Council of Iranian Teachers’ Trade Associations (CCITTA) on Saturday called for a nationwide strike in protest at the recent deaths and detention of students in the country, according to a statement published on Telegram. The council also announced a period of public mourning for students who have died in recent weeks from Thursday through Saturday, and called for a sit-in on Sunday, October 23 and Monday, October 24.\n\nProtests took place in central Berlin on Saturday, with close to 80,000 people standing in solidarity with Iran, German state broadcaster RBB reported, citing police officials.\n\nThe digest\n\nIsrael and Lebanon could sign maritime border agreement on Thursday, Biden energy adviser says\n\nSenior US adviser for global energy security Amos Hochstein said on Sunday that Israel and Lebanon could sign their historic maritime borders agreement as early as Thursday.\n\nBackground: “We’re going to have a deal. We’re going to sign it hopefully this Thursday,” Hochstein said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “And I hope that this continues our commitment to stability in the region and prosperity for both countries,” he added.\n\nWhy it matters: The US-brokered agreement settles a years-long maritime border dispute involving major oil and gas fields in the Mediterranean. Still technically at war, Lebanon and Israel both have much to gain. Not only does the agreement cool down recent security tensions, it also allows Israel to begin drilling and exporting gas to Europe and offers potential economic relief to Lebanon.\n\nHuman Rights Watch says LGBTQ people subjected to arrest and mistreatment in Qatar ahead of World Cup\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Qatar’s security forces of arbitrarily arresting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people and subjecting them to ill-treatment in detention ahead of the FIFA World Cup.\n\nBackground: HRW said in a report issued Monday that it documented six cases of “severe and repeated beatings and five cases of sexual harassment in police custody between 2019 and 2022,” the most recent of which took place in September. Security forces arrested people in public places based solely on their gender expression and unlawfully searched their phones, the HRW report said, adding that as a requirement for their release, security forces mandated that transgender women detainees attend “conversion therapy sessions” at a government-sponsored “behavioral healthcare” center. Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and punishable by imprisonment. A Qatari official told CNN that the HRW allegations “contain information that is categorically and unequivocally false.”\n\nWhy it matters: Ahead of the FIFA World Cup, which starts November 20, Qatar has said it would welcome LGBT visitors, after concerns were raised from the LGBT community over how safe they will be at the tournament.\n\nEgypt has ordered the release of prominent activist, presidential pardon committee member says\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday pardoned a prominent activist and former parliamentarian, Zyad el-Elaimy, according to a presidential pardon committee member.\n\nBackground: Jailed since 2019, el-Elaimy was one of the key participants in the 2011 uprisings that led to the downfall of former longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. His release is “in response to calls by political parties and forces,” presidential pardon committee member Tarek el-Khouly wrote on Facebook. Young members of political parties, politicians and the presidential pardon committee also coordinated to help secure his release, added el-Khouly. El-Elaimy was given a five-year sentence last year on charges of spreading false news.\n\nWhy it matters: The release comes two weeks ahead of November’s COP27 summit in Egypt. The country has come in for sharp criticism in recent months, with activists denouncing global leaders’ attendance in the light of Sisi’s questionable human rights record. Egypt has been promoting moves to improve its rights record, but activists and critics have described recent reforms as mostly cosmetic.\n\nWhat’s trending\n\nA view of a light and sound show during Deepotsav celebrations, on the eve of the Diwali, on October 23 in Ayodhya, India.

As a result, “even critical services such as emergency departments and maternity wards are likely to be operating with a skeleton staff, although bosses will prioritise urgent care”.\n\nThe strikes are happening at a time when the healthcare system is “still trying to rebalance itself in a post-pandemic world living with Covid”, wrote Sky News.\n\nWhile each month it seems that “another part of the Covid apparatus gets dismantled” – such as the end of the ONS infection survey and the closing of the NHS app at the end of this month – the pandemic’s “legacy” means that “the NHS is seeing pressures usually reserved for the winter all year round”.\n\nDemand for healthcare services is the highest it’s ever been, said Dr David Shackleton, an A&E consultant at West Middlesex Hospital, leaving waiting times longer and causing delays in seeing the sickest people.\n\nAnd Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, warned on Monday that industrial action this week posed risks to patient safety and called on the public to avoid “risky behaviour”.\n\nHowever, Dr Sumi Manirajan, from the BMA, told Sky News that last month’s walkouts showed patients’ safety was not compromised and hospital units could be filled with existing staff.\n\n“We were able to do 72-hour strikes safely, that demonstrates that we do have expert clinicians who can safely step down and we do have enough doctors to cover the wards,” she said. “If this changes or there is a mass-casualty event we urge every trust to contact us because patient safety is first and foremost.”\n\nThe BMA has said it has plans to call doctors off picket lines if lives were in immediate danger, in line with trade union laws, reported the BBC. But the industrial action by junior doctors “contrasts with recent strikes by nurses and ambulance workers, which saw unions agree to exempt certain emergency services”, said the broadcaster.\n\nJunior doctors, however argue they are striking \"for patient safety as much as about pay, saying that current pay levels are affecting recruitment and leading to many doctors leaving the profession”.\n\nWhat next?\n\nJunior doctors “have a grievance”, said The Sunday Telegraph, but “finding a doctor, as opposed to a role, whose income has fallen by 35 per cent over the past 10 years would not be easy”, the paper said, “yet that is the pay demand being made by the BMA”.\n\nThe BMA is couching its demands in “altruism, claiming such an increase is necessary to avert a retention crisis in the NHS”, said the paper. “The threat is that these well-trained doctors will up sticks and leave the profession or even the country unless their demands are met”, it added, “which hardly sounds like a commitment to the health service they wish to preserve.”\n\nBut this week’s industrial action will show “how radicalised doctors have become due not just to cuts in pay but also to the Covid-19 pandemic, to poor conditions and to the frustrations of working in a health service that is slowly imploding”, said The Guardian.\n\nAnd junior doctors’ last campaign of industrial action, which took place in 2016 over contracts and weekend working hours, is “also a big, though under-appreciated, factor in their thinking”. Many junior doctors believe they ultimately lost that dispute as “the contract they loathed was ultimately imposed anyway, despite their year-long series of walkouts”. And now they are “determined to stop history repeating itself”.\n\nThe BMA has delayed the ballot for a consultants’ strike until May, following what it described as “constructive talks with the Treasury” and “positive discussions” with Barclay. But “there has been no such movement or indication of a mutual understanding in the government’s stand-off with junior doctors”, said Sky News.\n\nBarclay accused the BMA of maintaining an “unrealistic position”, which meant talks ground to a standstill, accusing the union of being “intent on maintaining a militant stance rather than working with the Government and NHS management to meet the best interests of their members and of patients”.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, the BMA said it had “no offer whatsoever” from the health secretary.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Rebekah Evans", "The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Elliott Goat", "Richard Windsor"], "publish_date": "2023/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/958317/can-devolution-in-northern-ireland-still-work", "title": "Stormont stalemate: can devolution in Northern Ireland still work ...", "text": "February will mark two years since the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) brought down Stormont's power-sharing government in protest over post-Brexit trade checks between Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe nation's next deadline for forming a government is looming, with early assembly elections on the cards if an executive is not formed by 18 January.\n\nBut this ultimatum will \"more than likely be ignored\" by Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, said ITV News , particularly given it coincides with the biggest ever strike by public sector workers.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

This referred to the £3.3 billion package the government has offered in return for the restoration of the executive at Stormont.\n\nEarlier this week, Sinn Féin, Northern Ireland's largest political party, called the talks a \"charade\" and accused Downing Street of \"facilitating\" them for \"far too long\" with no conclusion, said the BBC .\n\nCan a breakthrough be achieved?\n\nThere is hope the stalemate could be broken. The \"increasing public pressure\" and threat of \"mass strikes\" could see the executive \"restored in the new year\", said the Belfast Telegraph in December, with unnamed DUP sources suggesting to the paper that it was \"inevitable\".\n\nPublicly, however, the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson has said the government's current offer is not a \"sound basis\" for reforming the executive and said the £3.3 billion offer did not include \"the recurrent aspect of that public sector pay award\" for next year's Stormont budget – despite the UK government's offer including almost £600 million for a public sector pay deal.\n\nWhile Northern Ireland's other parties appear to have accepted that the UK has \"made a final offer and the time for talking was exhausted\", the DUP still appears to be in \"haggle mode\". The party is seeking more stringent legal assurances from Westminster over Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market, said Politico in December.\n\nNorthern Ireland's political leaders have \"accused Donaldson of refusing to accept political reality\" and preventing the £584 million \"financial injection\" to the public sector, the news site added.\n\n\"This is starting to feel a bit like a bad break-up, where one person has listed themselves on Facebook as single and the other one is still claiming: 'It's complicated',\" said former justice minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long at the end of December's failed negotiations. \"These talks are over.\"\n\nWill the strikes force the DUP to act?\n\nThe legislative deadline for re-establishing Stormont's power-sharing government coincides with Northern Ireland's biggest ever strikes, as thousands of civil servants, health and education staff take action over pay and conditions.\n\nThe strike may \"increase pressure\" on the DUP to end its block on power-sharing, while the Northern Ireland secretary will also come under pressure to resolve the dispute in the absence of a Stormont executive, said the BBC.\n\nBut Heaton-Harris has said the matter is for local ministers to resolve and said pay claims could be settled with the £584 million package on offer for the public sector in the event of a Stormont return.\n\nAssuming the assembly election deadline is pushed back as expected, parties in Stormont will \"already be preparing for a Westminster election\" that is expected later this year. But a failure to restore the devolved government this year will \"raise the question: What is the alternative?\"\n\nIn August, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar called for a \"Plan B\" if Stormont was not restored, urging the UK and Irish governments to \"work hand-in-glove and apply both pressure and support – in a coordinated way\" to restore power-sharing.\n\nShould Stormont be restored, Sinn Féin's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, is set to become Northern Ireland's first minister.

Nevertheless, “unions are seeking to narrow the gap”, said Bloomberg, “with shortages of skilled labour giving them leverage”.\n\nA wave of strikes has already taken place across Europe, and looks set to continue into the winter. In November, workers in Greece participated in a 24-hour general strike that saw “thousands of protesters march through Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki”, said Fox News. Workers in Belgium also held a general strike last month, bringing the country to a “virtual standstill” as union leaders demanded pay increases to offset the effects of soaring inflation, according to Le Monde.\n\nIn France, where inflation has hit 6.2%, the lowest of any eurozone nation, rail workers will be striking over pay and conditions in action that will last through much of the Christmas season and into January. Spain, too, has seen workers demanding higher wages in order to keep up with inflation, with thousands packing themselves into Madrid’s Plaza Mayor “in the country’s first mass protest since the start of the cost of living crisis”, said Reuters.\n\nWhat next?\n\nIn general, strikes are more common in Europe than in the UK. Data from the European Trade Union Institute found that the average number of strike days per thousand workers per year was 22.3 in Europe in 2019, compared to just 4.9 in the UK.\n\nNevertheless, strike action in Britain is reaching close to unprecedented levels. The Daily Mail has called the wave of strikes taking place this winter as a “general strike in all but name” as the paper calls for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to “rein in militant unions”.\n\nBut a general strike of the kind last seen in Britain in 1926 – the UK’s first and only mass withholding of labour – is now all but impossible. “Trade union laws introduced after the General Strike and tightened in the 1980s restrict disputes to successful ballots at individual workplaces,” said The Guardian. “Nonetheless, some union leaders say they are coordinating action for maximum impact,” said the paper, and some “1.5 million workers could again be on picket lines by Christmas”.\n\nIndeed, the government’s view is “no longer a case of whether industrial action will take place but rather a case of when and on what scale”, said Steven Swinford in The Times. He fears that strikes “are likely to become a routine fact of life in the run up to the next election”.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Sunak has said he is working on “new tough laws” to curb strike action. This may include plans to “outlaw strikes by ambulance workers and firefighters early next year”, ensure “minimum service levels across the public sector on strike days” and “raising the threshold in strike ballots and doubling the minimum notice period”, said Politico’s London Playbook.\n\nBut Sunak’s government “doesn’t have a mandate to ban all emergency workers from striking” and anti-strike legislation could well “be held up in the Lords”, continued Playbook. “Whatever happens measures are likely to take time to implement” – with changes unlikely to be in place before the next election.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Elliott Goat", "Richard Windsor", "David Faris", "Rafi Schwartz"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959353/macrons-pensions-reform-battle", "title": "Macron's pensions reform battle | The Week", "text": "More than a million people took to the streets across France last week to protest against President Emmanuel Macron’s controversial plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.\n\nSome 1.12 million people took part in the nationwide protests, according to the interior ministry, with trade unions claiming the figure was even higher. The size of the demonstrations “took the government and its internal security services by surprise”, said John Lichfield for UnHerd. The marches were “especially large in the mid-sized, provincial towns where trades’ unions appeals for nationwide strikes usually go disregarded”, Lichfield added.\n\nThe protests will worry President Macron, who “has staked his second term – and his reputation as an economic reformer – on making the French work longer for their pensions”, said Politico’s Paul Taylor.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Beginning in 2027, individuals would be required to work for 43 years, rather than the current 42.\n\nIt is part of a sweeping welfare reform agenda, which Macron sees as the “defining act” of his second term, said The Times. The French president says that reform is vital to ensure the solvency of the state pension system, which is facing a deficit for the next five decades. “Otherwise, we’ll be financing our retirement system on credit,” Macron told Le Monde.\n\nSpeaking during a Franco-Spanish summit in Barcelona, he said the reform was “just and responsible” and pledged to carry it through with “respect and a spirit of dialogue but with determination”.\n\nHis allies highlight that even with the proposed increase in the legal retirement age to 64, it would still be earlier than in many other developed countries.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nMany European nations have “taken steps to raise the official retirement age”, said the BBC, “with Italy and Germany, for example, on 67 and Spain on 65. In the UK it is currently 66”.\n\nBut despite the government’s assertion that this measure is necessary to preserve the country’s share-out pension system, the reform has met with significant opposition. A poll conducted by IFOP this week revealed that 68% of the French public is against the proposed change.\n\nOne protester told AFP: “Macron wants us to die on the job. We get up very early. Some colleagues wake up at 3am. Working until 64 is too much.”\n\nWhat next?\n\nFrance’s leading trade unions have been “buoyed” by the success of Thursday’s strike action and are now calling for a second day of strikes on 31 January, in a bid to force Macron and his government to back down, said Reuters.\n\n“Now, the government finds itself with its back to the wall,” said France’s leading unions in a joint statement. “Everyone knows that raising the retirement age only benefits employers and the wealthy.”\n\nThe unions “are hoping to pull off a repeat of what happened in 1995, when prolonged disruptive industrial action combined with broad public support to force then-president Jacques Chirac’s government to ditch pension reforms”, said France24.\n\nMacron will also be “conscious” of the legacy left by the gilet jaunes, an “anti-government protest movement that erupted in 2018 from the ground up, without trade union leadership”, said The Guardian.\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether public anger over the change to the pension age, as well as the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, will be enough to “swell” the current protests into a broader movement.\n\nIt’s not the first time Macron has had to deal with opposition to his pension reform plans. A previous attempt in 2019 left the president facing the longest-running rail strikes since May 1968, with those plans eventually being shelved during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd Macron’s proposals will also still need to make it through parliament, where his Renaissance party no longer enjoys an absolute majority. The government will therefore have to rely on the support of the right-wing Les Republicains to get the bill passed.\n\nIt is not certain that “Macron’s determination and appeal to rational economics is enough”, but “what model might a second Macron failure set for the rest of the world?” asked CNN’s David A.

In early February a freight train carrying hazardous materials derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, leading to a major environmental disaster and forcing about half the town’s 5,000 residents to evacuate.\n\nThe incident has “stoked outrage” across the US at the train company involved, Norfolk Southern, and the government’s “lacklustre” response. Residents still have “lingering worries” about the long-term health impacts of the crash, said The Guardian. On Saturday, another Norfolk Southern freight train derailed near the town of Springfield, Ohio. No one was injured and the derailed carriages were not carrying hazardous material this time.\n\nHow safe is rail travel in Europe?\n\nThe deadly crash in Greece is one of the worst rail disasters in Europe in recent years but goes against an overall downward trend in the European Union over the past 40 years in the number of rail accidents and fatalities.\n\nAccording to a 2022 report on Railway Safety and Interoperability in the EU, railways in Europe remain “among the safest in the world” with major accidents involving five or more fatalities becoming “increasingly rare”. However, the report said that progress has been “very uneven” across all EU member states, and pointed to “a significant variation in safety levels”.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nThe report, compiled by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA), found that “one of the main drivers of disparities in safety levels seems to be the level of safety of the railway infrastructure” across Europe. “The deployment of advanced train protection systems (TPSs) and railside protected level crossing devices” varies greatly across EU member states.\n\nAccording to the latest figures available, there were 1,331 significant accidents, 687 fatalities and 469 serious injuries were reported in EU countries in 2020, which are “the lowest values ever recorded”.\n\nSince 1980, there has been an overall “downward trend” in major accidents and fatalities across EU railways. In 2020 and 2021, there were no accidents resulting in five or more fatalities although there were two such accidents in 2019. The number of fatal train collisions and derailments has “decreased continuously” since 1990, although 2020 saw a peak of eight major train collisions or derailments.\n\nWhat about in the US?\n\nAccording to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the accident rate is down 28% since 2000 with the last decade being the “safest ever”.\n\nData from the Federal Railroad Administration revealed that accidents on mainline railways are at “an all-time low” and down 49% since 2000. And for all railroads, the accident rate has declined 44% since 2000.\n\nIncidents of derailment are down 31% since 2000, however they were up by 5% year on year. According to the AAR, the hazardous materials (hazmat) accident rate is down 78% since 2000, which represents “the lowest ever based on preliminary Bureau of Explosives data”.\n\nHowever, USA Today analysis showed that in the case of Norfolk Southern, the company involved in the two recent Ohio derailments, “the rate of accidents has been ticking up” over the past decade. And so have its numbers on carriages carrying hazmat materials that have been damaged or derailed, “with 14 damaged or derailed in 2012, a peak of 117 in 2020 and 85 in 2021”, said the news site.\n\nAnd how safe is it in the UK?\n\nIn the UK, there have been no major accidents that have resulted in passenger or workforce fatalities since August 2020, when three people were killed in a derailment at Carmont, in Scotland. The accident followed “13 years with no passenger or workforce fatalities in accidents of that type in Britain”, according to data from the Office of Rail and Road.\n\nAccording to the latest data, there were 11 passenger or public facilities on the UK’s rail network in the year to March 2022, an increase from six in the previous year while the country was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nSix fatalities occurred in mainline stations, two occurred on the London Underground and three fatalities occurred after collisions between members of the public and trams.\n\nThere were 9,065 workforce and non-workforce injuries in the latest year, an increase of 64.1% compared with the previous lockdown-affected year.

The union launched a campaign over the weekend that claimed baristas at Pret a Manger made more per hour than a junior doctor. It said that while the sandwich chain will pay “up to £14.10 per hour” to its staff, a junior doctor “makes just £14.09”.\n\n“Thanks to this government you can make more serving coffee than saving patients,” said the campaign. “This week junior doctors will take strike action so they are paid what they are worth.”\n\nAlmost a third of junior NHS doctors now say they are tempted by a move to Australia, which offers “fewer hours” and “50 per cent more pay” as well as “great coffee, great beaches and great weather”, said Dr Matt Morgan in The Spectator.\n\nThe NHS is already facing a shortfall of some 12,000 hospital doctors and 50,000 nurses. But “the good news” is that “the haemorrhage of staff can be treated”, said Morgan, as “few people really want to leave their home, their country and their family”.\n\nYet doctors need to feel “valued and supported by the system. It is imperative that the UK retains its doctors,” added Morgan. “Any health service is, after all, completely and utterly reliant on them.”\n\n‘35% pay increase has raised eyebrows’\n\nBut in response to the campaign, government aides have argued that “the average junior doctor earned £55,436 in 2021-22, when counting payments for night and weekend shifts”, reported Politico. Indeed, the argument being put forward by the BMA is “more complicated than the ones put forward by most other unions” and has “raised eyebrows”, said the BBC.\n\nThat’s because “no junior doctor has seen pay cut by 26%” since 2008. “There are five core pay points in the junior doctor contract with each a springboard to the next. It means they move up the pay scale over time until they finish their training,” explained the BBC. A junior doctor in 2008 “may well be a consultant now, perhaps earning four times in cash terms what they were then”.\n\nIn its editorial today, The Telegraph said: “People may sympathise with the medics, who have seen their real incomes fall in recent years, but they are not alone in that.\n\n“Many whose treatments will be postponed are in the same predicament and are often paid far less than doctors,” added the paper. It argued that the pay rise being sought by the BMA is “ludicrously high at a time when most are having to accept less than the inflation rate”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Joel Mathis", "The Week Us", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/03/13"}]}

Then a year later, he went back – the way he came.\n\nMore than one month since the man crossed the demilitarized zone from South to North Korea, much of his life in both countries remains a mystery – as do his reasons for returning to the isolated nation ruled by Kim Jong Un.\n\nSouth Korean media reported that the defector – who hasn’t been officially named, although fellow defectors say he was called Kim Woo-jeong in South Korea – was a former gymnast who largely kept to himself. According to South Korean police, he was a construction worker in his 30s who earned money by doing manual labor.\n\nThe man’s case is rare – while more than 10,000 North Korean defectors have arrived in South Korea in the past decade, just 30 have returned home, where they face the prospect of being put into forced labor camps, according to official South Korean data.\n\nBut defectors and advocates say even if the man’s rationale for leaving South Korea is unclear, the fact that some North Korean defectors are willing to return to one of the world’s most politically isolated countries only highlights how challenging life can be in the South for North Koreans.\n\nWhy people defect\n\nSince the Korean War ended with an armistice in 1953, North and South Korea have been separated by an almost impenetrable border preventing anyone from crossing to the other side.\n\nOver subsequent decades, South Korea has modernized, becoming one of the world’s richest and most technologically developed countries. Meanwhile, North Korea has become increasingly isolated, with citizens subject to widespread poverty and limited basic freedoms.\n\nSo it isn’t hard to see why people may want to escape.\n\nSince 1998, more than 33,000 people have defected from North Korea to South Korea, according to South Korea’s Unification Ministry. However, numbers have dwindled in recent years after Kim imposed even tougher border controls to prevent Covid inflows.\n\nOn very rare occasions, defectors – like the former gymnast – manage to escape through the heavily guarded demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea. The vast majority, like defector Kang Chun-hyuk, flee over North Korea’s lengthy border with China.\n\nKang’s family made the trip in 1998 when he was 12 years old, before finally making it to South Korea a few years later.\n\nPeople gather before the statues of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in 2021 to mark the 10th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's death. Kim Won Jin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn North Korea, Kang remembers barely having enough food to survive.\n\nSometimes, his family would make a single portion of dry noodles into a meal that would feed him and his parents for a week.\n\n“It wasn’t worth going to school, so me and my classmates stole food like corn or potatoes,” he said.\n\nAccording to a survey of 3,000 people released this year by the North Korean Refugees Foundation, food shortages are one of the most common motivations for defection, with nearly 22% saying that was why they had defected. The most common reason given – at 23% – was that people didn’t like being controlled or monitored by the North Korean regime.\n\nOnce they arrive in South Korea, there are measures in place to support them. Defectors undergo a compulsory, 12-week education session to help them adjust to life in their new home. They’re given financial support and accommodation, and access to health care and employment services.\n\nBut even so, life for defectors is often a struggle.\n\nFinding work and fitting in\n\nBefore Kang Na-ra – no relation to Kang Chun-hyuk – defected in 2014 as a teenager, she thought her life in South Korea would mirror the K-dramas she watched in secret in the city of Chongjin.\n\nBut South Korea was a far cry from the romantic world she’d seen on screen.\n\nKang Na-ra’s mother defected before her – she does not want to say why – but their life together in South Korea was not what she’d hoped.\n\nThe North Korean border county of Kaepoong from a South Korean observatory at the southern boundary of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHer mother worked long hours and was often away from home dancing in a North Korean defectors performing group to make ends meet. Although Kang Na-ra spoke the same language, she was lonely and had few friends in South Korea.\n\nAnother defector, who asked not to be named or further identified for fear of repercussions for his family remaining in North Korea, said he also struggled with culture shock when he defected a few years ago – even bright and colorful signs and the abundance of English words used in language in South Korea made him feel uncomfortable.\n\n“You don’t see things like that in North Korea,” said the defector. “I didn’t like many things in South Korea at first.”\n\nHe also said many defectors found it difficult to get a job.\n\nStatistics for 2020 released last year by South Korea’s Unification Ministry found defectors had a higher unemployment rate than the general population, with 9.4% of defectors unemployed, compared with 4% of the general population in December 2020.\n\n“Getting a good job is important, but even South Koreans who are raised and educated here find it difficult to get a decent job,” he said. “You can imagine how hard it can be for North Korean defectors.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Mom and son defect from N. Korea, starve to death in S. Korea 02:11 - Source: CNN\n\nKang Chun-hyuk’s family was given a flat by the government when they made it to South Korea in 2001 after three years in China. But his thick North Korean accent made it hard for him to fit in at school and he dropped out. He worked in manual labor until he was 25 years old, unsure if he would be able to ever do anything else.\n\nFor others, the struggle to adjust and find work can have deadly consequences. In 2019, North Korean defector Han Sang-ok was found dead in her apartment with her 6-year-old son after she failed to pay her bills for months.\n\nA water meter inspector noticed a foul smell coming from the apartment and called the police, who found two heavily decomposed bodies and an empty fridge, leading the police officer to note starvation as the suspected cause of death.\n\nSeparation pains\n\nBut not all defectors have dreams of a bright life in South Korea.\n\nKim Ryon-hui is a rare case of a defector who arrived almost by accident.\n\nThe 54-year-old, who lived a relatively upscale life in North Korea, went to China in 2011 to visit relatives and seek medical care for liver disease. But when she arrived, she found Chinese doctors wanted payment upfront.\n\nKim Ryon-hui desperately wants to get back to North Korea. Charlie Miller/CNN\n\nKim said a broker told her Chinese people often went to South Korea to earn money. So, she signed up for a journey to South Korea and left her North Korean passport with the broker group – not realizing that meant she would never be able to return home.\n\nKim feels hostility from South Koreans, especially when North Korea’s leader fires missiles. She told CNN she struggled to adapt to a capitalist society governed by market pressures and to understand what she sees as a dog-eat-dog world.\n\n“It’s like we’re oil and South Korea is water, so we can’t mix,” she said.\n\nThat’s a common sentiment for defectors. According to the North Korean Refugees Foundation survey, while most people are happy in South Korea because they can live a free life and earn relative to how much they work, many are unhappy with the level of intense competition.\n\nBut the hardest part for Kim is the separation from her family. South Korean law prevents any communication with people in North Korea and South Koreans cannot travel there. Unless Kim sneaks back into North Korea, or the two Koreas reach a peace agreement, she has little chance of seeing her family again.\n\nKim last saw her daughter when she was 17 – now her daughter is 28. Kim is only able to communicate with her family through journalists who take letters and gifts for her to North Korea, but that hasn’t been possible since North Korea closed its borders due to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\n“It’s scary to be alone,” she said. “When I see lights on in other apartments in the evening, I imagine families having dinner together. That’s the saddest and loneliest feeling.”\n\nWhy defectors return\n\nDespite the difficulties of being in South Korea, the vast majority stay put. For most, that’s because the benefits of staying in South Korea are far greater than the risks they face if they return.\n\nSeo Jae-pyeong, the director of the Association of the North Korean Defectors, defected in 2001. In the 20 years he’s lived in South Korea, he’s only known one defector personally who returned to North Korea.\n\nShe was a doctor with a family back in North Korea who didn’t realize her brother was bringing her to South Korea, he said.\n\n“She didn’t have a reason to defect and she couldn’t get used to life in South Korea,” Seo said.\n\nAnti-North Korea activists and refugees from North Korea attend a protest against a summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, in Seoul on February 26, 2019. Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe questioned how many of the 30 defectors who returned to North Korea had left of their own free will. He said some may have been blackmailed or kidnapped near the border between China and North Korea.\n\nOthers might have had major financial difficulties that left them with few other choices.\n\nLee Na-kyung, a defector activist for single parents and people with disabilities from the North, said by the time many defectors arrive in South Korea they already have major debts to brokers who helped them cross the border.\n\nSome defectors pay their government settlement money to the brokers, and then sink further into debt as they struggle to find work, according to Lee, who defected from North Korea in 2005 after her husband was framed for a crime she says he didn’t commit.\n\nFor some, the hardship of life in South Korea doesn’t meet their expectations. She knows of one man who was a high-ranking military officer in North Korea who could only find work in a junkyard in South Korea. “He said that he would rather die at home instead of dying as a junkman,” she said.\n\nWhat next?\n\nA month after the gymnast Kim crossed back into North Korea, it’s unclear whether he is still alive.\n\nAlthough the South Korean military spotted him on surveillance footage crossing the barbed wires into the demilitarized zone, they failed to stop him, the South Korean military’s Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Won In-choul said in a briefing in January.\n\nHe was seen four times on security camera on the south side of the border, and once after he crossed the Military Demarcation Line.\n\nAt one point, soldiers mistook him for a defector coming from the North. At another point, they went to find him. Later, they found no trace of him except a feather caught on a wire that they suspected had come from his puffer jacket.\n\nThere were “no unusual movements” of the North Korean military over the incident, South Korea’s Defense Ministry spokesman Boo Seung-chan said last month at another briefing.\n\nAnd while North Korean state media has crowed about past defectors returning home, there has been no mention of last month’s defector in state news publications.\n\nFor those in South Korea, it’s a reminder that the country’s policies to help defectors could still be improved. Last week, the South Korean government announced it was launching a new team to improve the safety of defectors, noting that despite its current efforts, some defectors were still “experiencing difficulties settling into our society.”\n\nBut defector advocates were dubious about how effective those new steps would be, pointing out that support measures are in place – they just don’t work.\n\nKang Na-ra on her YouTube channel. From Kang Na-ra/YouTube\n\nEven defectors who appear to have successfully made their transition sometimes struggle with the pull back to North Korea.\n\nTwo years after she defected, Kang Na-ra told her mother she wanted to go back. But she didn’t want to risk her life after going through so much to get to South Korea.\n\nNow Kang, 25, is a television personality and YouTuber with more than 300,000 subscribers who watch her clips about life in North Korea. Her income is unstable, but at least she’s enjoying life.\n\n“Still today, I wonder if I made the right decision,” she said. “Life here is tough.”", "authors": ["Yoonjung Seo Julia Hollingsworth", "Yoonjung Seo", "Julia Hollingsworth"], "publish_date": "2022/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/europe/italy-election-results-intl/index.html", "title": "Giorgia Meloni claims victory to become Italy's most far-right prime ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBrothers of Italy leader Giorgia Meloni has claimed victory in a general election that seems set to install her as Italy’s first female prime minister, leading the most far-right government since the fascist era of Benito Mussolini.\n\nAddressing the media and supporters in the early hours of Monday morning, Meloni said it was “a night of pride for many and a night of redemption.”\n\n“It’s a victory I want to dedicate to everyone who is no longer with us and wanted this night,” she said. “Starting tomorrow we have to show our value … Italians chose us, and we will not betray it, as we never have,” she said.\n\nPreliminary results put an alliance of far-right parties, led by Meloni’s ultraconservative Brothers of Italy party, on track to win at least 44% of the vote, according to the Italian Interior Ministry.\n\nWith 63% of votes counted, the Brothers of Italy party had won at least 26%, with coalition partners the League, led by Matteo Salvini, taking around 9% and Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia scoring over 8%. Final results are expected later Monday, but it’s expected to take weeks for a new government to be formed.\n\nMeloni entered Italy’s crowded political scene in 2006 and co-founded the Brothers of Italy in 2012, a party whose agenda is rooted in Euroskepticism and anti-immigration policies.\n\nLeader of Brothers of Italy Giorgia Meloni casts her vote in Rome on Sunday, September 25, 2022. Yara Nardi/Reuters\n\nIn the last election in 2018, the party won just 4.5% of the vote, but its popularity has soared in recent years, underscoring Italy’s longstanding rejection of mainstream politics, seen most recently with the country’s support of anti-establishment parties such as the Five Star Movement and Salvini’s League.\n\nCelebrating the early results on Sunday evening, Salvini said on Twitter, “Center-right in clear advantage both in the House and in the Senate! It will be a long night, but already now I want to say THANK YOU.”\n\nMeloni differs from her coalition partner leaders on the issue of Ukraine. Whereas Berlusconi and Salvini have both said they would like to review sanctions against Russia because of their impact on the Italian economy, Meloni has been steadfast in her support for defending Ukraine.\n\nA 45-year-old mother from Rome, Meloni is deeply conservative, openly anti-LBGT, and has threatened to place same-sex unions, which were legalized in Italy in 2016, under review. She has also called abortion a “tragedy,” raising fears for the future of women’s rights in the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Ultra-conservative likely to become Italy's first female prime minister 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\n‘A sad evening’\n\nThe preliminary results showed the center-left coalition, led by the left-wing Democratic Party and centrist party +Europe had won around 22% of the vote, while former prime minister Giuseppe Conte’s bid to revive the Five Star Movement appeared to have been unsuccessful, with around 15%.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Conte promised to lead an “uncompromising opposition.”\n\n“We will be the outpost for the progressive agenda against inequalities, to protect families and businesses in difficulty, to defend the rights and values of our Constitution.”\n\nDebora Serracchiani of the Democratic Party also conceded defeat early Monday morning, calling the results a “sad evening for the country.”\n\n“Undoubtedly we cannot, in light of the data seen so far, not attribute the victory to the right dragged by Giorgia Meloni. It is a sad evening for the country,” Serracchiani told reporters.\n\nSunday’s snap national election was triggered by party infighting that saw the collapse of Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government in July.\n\nVoters headed to the polls amid a number of new regulations, with voting hours also contained to one day rather than two.\n\nOther changes included a younger voting age for the Senate and a reduction in the number of seats to elect – down from 685 seats to 400 in the Senate and from 315 to 200 in the lower House of Parliament. That parliament is scheduled to meet on October 13, at which point the head of state will call on party leaders to decide on the shape of the new government.\n\nThe buildup to the election was dominated by hot-button issues including Italy’s cost-of-living crisis, a 209 billion euro ($200 billion) package from the European Covid-19 recovery fund and the country’s support for Ukraine.\n\nThe incoming prime minister – the sixth in just eight years – will be tasked with tackling a number of challenges, with soaring energy costs and economic uncertainty among the country’s most pressing.\n\nAnd while Meloni is slated to make history as Italy’s first female prime minister, her politics do not mean that she is necessarily interested in advancing women’s rights.\n\nEmiliana De Blasio, adviser for diversity and inclusion at LUISS University in Rome, told CNN Meloni is “not raising up at all questions on women’s rights and empowerment in general.”\n\nThe Italian results come as other far-right parties in other European countries have marked recent gains. That includes Sweden’s anti-immigration party, Sweden Democrats – a party with neo-Nazi roots – which is expected to play a major role in the new government after winning the second largest share of seats at a general election earlier this month.\n\nAnd in France, while far-right ideologue Marine Le Pen lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in April, her share of the popular vote shifted France’s political center dramatically to the right.\n\nAlthough Macron and Meloni ideologically diverge, the French president said Monday that France respects Italy’s decision to elect a government headed by Meloni.\n\nSince former German Chancellor Angela Merkel stepped down in December, Macron has increasingly emerged as the top EU leader – a position that would put him at odds with the Euroskepticism expressed by the Brothers of Italy.\n\n“The Italian people have made a democratic and sovereign choice. We respect it,” Macron said, according to the Elysee Palace.\n\n“As a neighbor and friend, we must continue to work together. It’s as Europeans that we will succeed in overcoming our joint challenges,” he added.\n\nIn a social media post early Monday, Meloni dedicated her projected win to “all the militants, managers, supporters and every single person who – in these years – has contributed to the realization of our dream, offering soul and heart spontaneously and selflessly.”\n\nShe added: “We won’t betray your trust. We are ready to lift Italy up.”", "authors": ["Kara Fox Barbie Latza Nadeau Antonia Mortensen Nicola Ruotolo Sharon Braithwaite Valentina Didonato", "Kara Fox", "Barbie Latza Nadeau", "Antonia Mortensen", "Nicola Ruotolo", "Sharon Braithwaite", "Valentina Didonato"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/asia/us-china-taiwan-strait-transit-intl-hnk-mic-ml/index.html", "title": "Why China's response to US warships in Taiwan Strait surprised ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter, a three-times-a-week update exploring what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world. Sign up here.\n\nSeoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nAfter United States House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in early August, the Chinese military staged some of its biggest ever military exercises around the island.\n\nChinese warplanes swarmed across the Taiwan Strait and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) even fired missiles over Taiwan, the democratically ruled island that the Chinese Communist Party claims as its sovereign territory despite having never controlled it.\n\nThose Chinese military exercises set what some analysts and officials feared might be a “new normal” across the strait: A more permanent PLA presence ever closer to Taiwan.\n\nUS officials, meanwhile, vowed Washington would stay the course and Chinese intimidation tactics would be challenged.\n\nOn Sunday, the US Navy sent two guided-missile cruisers through the strait, over which Beijing claims sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction under Chinese law and its interpretation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The US and others maintain the strait is international waters under the UN treaty.\n\nIt was the first time in at least four years the US Navy had sent two cruisers through the strait, said Collin Koh, research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, who has been keeping a database on the transits.\n\n“Having two instead of the usual one vessel to do this mission is certainly a ‘bigger’ signal of protest against not only Beijing’s recent military exercises around Taiwan following the Pelosi visit, but also in response to Beijing’s attempt to subvert the legal status of the waterway and the longstanding freedom of navigation rights through the area,” Koh said.\n\nThat the US warships made the transit Sunday was no surprise. They have made dozens of such voyages in recent years, and US officials had said transits would continue.\n\nWhat was surprising to analysts was the muted response from Beijing.\n\nThe Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command said it monitored the two ships, maintained a high alert and was “ready to thwart any provocation.”\n\nEven the state-run Global Times tabloid, known for its often jingoistic and staunchly nationalist editorials, said the presence of the two cruisers brought “no actual threat to China’s security.”\n\nPast transits have elicited a stronger response. After the destroyer USS Benfold went through the strait in July, Col. Shi Yi, spokesman for the PLA’s Eastern Theater Command, described the US as the “destroyer of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”\n\nWhile earlier this month, the Chinese ambassador to Washington, Qin Gang, called on the US to halt naval transits, saying they intensify tensions and embolden “Taiwan independence separatist forces.”\n\n“If there’s any move damaging China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, China will respond,” Qin told reporters in Washington in response to a question on possible upcoming transits.\n\nKoh, the analyst, noted Beijing’s comparatively tame statements Sunday.\n\n“Why didn’t the Chinese go beyond that given their earlier strong opposition to Washington’s professed intent to continue such transits?” he said, offering three possible factors.\n\nFirstly, Beijing may be wary of “international blowback,” as any attempt to curtail US Navy navigation through the strait could be seen as threatening the rights of vessels from other nations to go through the waterway.\n\nSecondly, after the Pelosi visit to Taiwan, Beijing suspended key military communications channels with Washington, raising the risk of misunderstandings during any PLA Navy-US Navy interaction.\n\nThirdly, there are other areas where Washington and Beijing do cooperate, and China may not want to strain those, Koh said.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense to provoke further heightened tensions that can potentially escalate into a clash,” he said.\n\nCarl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center in Hawaii, suggests a fourth possibility.\n\n“I think (Chinese leader Xi Jinping) is going to avoid any action that might strengthen the Republicans’ and other China hawks’ chances in the upcoming elections. He doesn’t want a House and Senate that may enact legislation that more strongly supports Taiwan, or limits Chinese investment and influence in the US,” Schuster said.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, the use of two cruisers in the latest strait transit might not be seen so much as a statement, but as reasonable military planning.\n\n“Given China’s threats and recent missile firings into international waters … it does seem prudent to have two warships transit those waters together,” Schuster said.\n\nAnd expect the US Navy to go about business as usual with regular transits of the strait, he said.\n\n“Under international law it is international waters and so there is no official dispute on its status,” he said. “The US Navy transit makes that statement quietly and effectively.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/08/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/europe/boris-johnson-ukraine-invasion-europe-comments-intl/index.html", "title": "Boris Johnson claims France was 'in denial' before Russia's ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed France was “in denial” about the prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, and accused the German government of initially favoring a quick Ukrainian military defeat over a long conflict.\n\nJohnson told CNN’s partner network CNN Portugal on Monday that the attitudes of Western nations varied widely before Moscow launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine on February 24, singling out three leading EU countries in comments that are unlikely to be welcomed in European capitals.\n\nHis comment drew a stinging denial from Germany, which accused the ex-pPM of having “a unique relationship with the truth.”\n\nWhile Johnson stressed that EU nations later rallied behind Ukraine and are now providing steadfast support, he said that was not universally the case in the period before the Russian invasion.\n\n“This thing was a huge shock … we could see the Russian battalion tactical groups amassing, but different countries had very different perspectives,” Johnson told CNN’s Richard Quest in Portugal.\n\n“The German view was at one stage that if it were going to happen, which would be a disaster, then it would be better for the whole thing to be over quickly, and for Ukraine to fold,” Johnson claimed, citing “all sorts of sound economic reasons” for that approach.\n\n“I couldn’t support that, I thought that was a disastrous way of looking at it. But I can understand why they thought and felt as they did,” Johnson went on. Germany has rapidly sought to reduce its reliance on Russian energy since Moscow’s invasion.\n\n“Be in no doubt that the French were in denial right up until the last moment,” Johnson also said.\n\nJohnson speaking with US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron during a June G7 summit in Germany. Pool/Getty Images\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron fronted Europe’s efforts to dissuade Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine, visiting him in the Kremlin just weeks before the Russian leader ordered his troops into the country. In March, the chief of French military intelligence, Gen. Eric Vidaud, was told to step down from his post partly for “failing to anticipate” the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a military source with knowledge of the matter told CNN at the time.\n\nJohnson also criticized Italy’s initial response to the threat of an invasion. He told Quest that its government – at the time led by Mario Draghi – was “at one stage simply saying that they would be unable to support the position we were taking,” given their “massive” reliance on Russian hydrocarbons.\n\nCNN has reached out to the French and German governments. Draghi’s office declined to comment.\n\nOn Wednesday Miguel Berger, the German ambassador to the UK, shared a comment on Twitter that he attributed to a government spokesperson: “We know that the very entertaining former Prime Minister always has a unique relationship with the truth. This case is also no exception.”\n\nMany observers initially believed a Russian invasion of Ukraine would be completed within weeks or days, but Kyiv’s forces instead repelled Moscow’s initial lunge towards the capital and have more recently conducted successful counter-offensives to regain ground in the east and south of the country.\n\nJohnson said that once Russia launched its invasion in February, attitudes across Europe changed quickly.\n\n“What happened was everybody – Germans, French, Italians, everybody, (US President) Joe Biden – saw that there was simply no option. Because you couldn’t negotiate with this guy (Putin). That’s the key point,” the ex-Prime Minister said, adding that the “the EU has done brilliantly” in its opposition of Russia since that time.\n\nJohnson during an August visit to Ukraine, alongside Volodymyr Zelensky. from 10 Downing Street\n\n“After all my anxieties … I pay tribute to the way the EU has acted.

Johnson was forced to resign in July after repeated scandals sank his reputation and caused dozens of his ministers to resign.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Boris Johnson talks about his chances of becoming prime minister again 04:16 - Source: CNN\n\nJohnson told CNN that Zelensky has been “absolutely outstanding” in his leadership. “He’s a very brave guy. I think the history of this conflict would have been totally, totally different it he hadn’t been there.”\n\nHe added that “if Ukraine chooses to be a member of the EU, they should go for it. and I think it would be a good thing for Ukraine,” helping it achieve political and economic reform.

Uriel Epshtein is the executive director of the Renew Democracy Initiative. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nIn our era of political polarization, hardly anything can unite a majority of Americans. That’s why new polling from CNN on the crisis in Ukraine is so encouraging: 84% of both Democrats and Republicans support increased economic sanctions against Russia. A remarkable 65% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats think we should be doing more to support the Ukrainians.\n\nGarry Kasparov Courtesy of Garry Kasparov\n\nUriel Epshtein Courtesy of Uriel Epshtein\n\nThis unity was obvious at President Joe Biden’s State of the Union on Tuesday, where Democrats and Republicans gave him and Ukrainian Ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova multiple standing ovations when the President discussed Ukraine’s fight for freedom.\n\nAnytime Americans agree on something is notable, but it is particularly remarkable given numerous partisan attempts to have us look away, do less and allow Russian leader Vladimir Putin to run roughshod over the Ukrainian people.\n\nWith the unity the American people now have, we must act quickly and decisively. First, we must continue to answer Putin’s war of aggression with an economic war of attrition. Already, the actions of democratic governments around the world are encouraging. Many Russian banks are being kicked out of SWIFT, a messaging service used for international banking, governments around the globe are announcing new measures to limit their economic ties to Russia every day, and even countries like Switzerland and Germany, traditionally averse to sanctions and military aid respectively, have reversed decades-old policies to punish Russia for its naked aggression.\n\nIf Putin ultimately does come to the negotiating table, the sanctions must not be lifted at that point. For far too long we’ve offered concessions as a sign of goodwill in our negotiations with a dictator who only answers to force. That failed strategy has earned us the largest war in Europe since 1945. Our economic warfare must not end until every Russian troop is out of Ukraine and a durable peace is achieved.\n\nSecond, we must go after the Russian oligarchs directly. The spoils of the Russian economy are siphoned by oligarchs who then park their money in luxury properties abroad. In exchange for backing Putin, they spend their summers along the Mediterranean cruising on yachts worth millions. Their children attend elite private schools in New England and the English countryside, then graduate into the Ivy League.\n\nIt’s time for the party to end. Seize their properties. Target the shell companies that protect their assets in tax havens. Deny them and their families visas to every country with a coastline, ski mountain or vineyard. Let them sit in Russia with the terrors they have enabled and see how long Putin’s war lasts. We won’t cut off the head of the snake; they will.\n\nThese measures are necessary, but the American unity they rely on may be fleeting. It’s easy to be unified when the shock of the Russian invasion is still fresh in our minds. When gas prices and inflation continue to soar, it will be harder. If supply chain issues worsen, it will be harder still.\n\nWhat Americans must recognize is any suffering we experience now is a necessary price to pay compared to the world we would be ushering in through inaction. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to tear apart the fabric of the rules-based world order countless Americans have died to create and defend. In the process, it would make the current shocks we’re experiencing our new normal.\n\nIn a world lacking order, border disputes will be settled through conflict, destabilizing entire regions. If Kyiv falls, will Moldova be next? Putin’s ally in Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, seemed to reveal plans to do just that. Meanwhile, China’s Xi Jinping is eyeing Taiwan for a forced “reunification” of the two countries that the Taiwanese leadership will not submit to peacefully. And fear of invasion from an increasingly belligerent China or North Korea has persuaded many South Koreans to support developing a nuclear arsenal of their own.\n\nDespite this reality, the mission to further undermine American support for Ukraine is ongoing. On Saturday, mere days after Putin invaded Ukraine, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) released a statement condemning Russia’s invasion and expressing solidarity with the Ukrainians. But in the same statement, they then reaffirmed their “call for the US to withdraw from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set the stage for this conflict.” In making such a plea, the Democratic Socialists managed to frame the US as the imperialist expansionist, even as Russia wages an unprovoked and bloody war of imperialist expansion.\n\nThen, on Sunday, Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman turned Fox News regular, implored America to call on Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Biden to “embrace the spirit of aloha” and declare Ukraine perpetually neutral, “thus alleviat[ing] the legitimate security concerns of both US/NATO countries and Russia.” By “legitimate security concerns” of Russia, we assume she means Putin’s desire to dominate his smaller neighbor.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThese voices may be on the fringe now, but they will likely grow louder. When that happens, we must remember though the cost of stopping Putin is high, the cost of allowing the world order to be rewritten is far greater.\n\nAmericans must maintain this unity, continue our support of the Ukrainian people and recognize the fight for democracy is about much more than one country’s ability to determine its own fate. The struggle for democracy is also about the ability to live in a world where disagreements can be solved through diplomacy, where human rights are protected and where peace is the status quo.\n\nWhen partisans attempt to undermine our support for Ukraine, when the effects of strong economic sanctions are felt at the gas pump and the grocery store, remember this is a struggle we must face head on.", "authors": ["Garry Kasparov Uriel Epshtein", "Garry Kasparov", "Uriel Epshtein"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/politics/migrant-buses-desantis-abbott-what-matters/index.html", "title": "The surprising details behind DeSantis' and Abbott's immigration ...", "text": "A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\nCNN —\n\nRepublican governors are in a cynical competition to outdo each other and send migrants from the US border by bus to New York, Washington, DC, Chicago and, now, by plane to Martha’s Vineyard.\n\nTwo unannounced planes carrying an estimated 50 migrants landed in the wealthy seaside enclave of Massachusetts on Wednesday night, surprising locals.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis claimed credit for the stunt, which took the migrants from Texas, not Florida, and left them without planning on the street.\n\nHis stunt may have been outdone by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who started sending buses of migrants to Washington, DC, back in April and on Thursday morning, left asylum-seekers outside Vice President Kamala Harris’ house at the US Naval Observatory. She’s under intense criticism from immigration hawks for saying on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that she was confident the border is “secure.”\n\nMany rightly pointed out that the political point came at the expense of vulnerable migrants who had already been through a tremendously arduous journey – but some of the details of the transport may surprise you. For starters, many of the migrants were appreciative of the ride.\n\nAre these migrants in the country illegally?\n\nThese stunts by Republican governors are built on the false idea that the migrants are in the country illegally. Technically, those on the buses and planes are asylum-seekers who have been processed by federal immigration authorities and are awaiting court dates.\n\nWhere are the migrants coming from?\n\nWhile most of these migrants crossed the border with Mexico, they are fleeing poor economies and dangerous situations at home in Central America and, increasingly, South America. After crossing the border and claiming asylum, they are released in the US to wait for hearings on their asylum claim.\n\nRELATED: A ‘radical shift’ at the border is making things tougher for Biden\n\nOne person left in Massachusetts, a 45-year-old named Leonel, told The New York Times about his three-month journey from Venezuela through Colombia and Central America. He tried more than once to cross the US border with Mexico before being detained and then released in San Antonio.\n\nIt was there that he was approached and asked if he wanted to go to Massachusetts. It’s not clear if he knew he was headed to a wealthy island community unprepared for the arrivals.\n\nAre they being forced on the buses and planes? No, they are not\n\nAnger at the stunts is in part also fed by the idea that the people are being forced onto buses. That is not true, as CNN’s Gary Tuchman found when he visited a shelter in Eagle Pass, Texas, in August.\n\nHe met asylum-seekers planning to meet up with family and friends already spread around the country. Other migrants coming to the US without somewhere to go were happy for the free trip.\n\nWho is happy for the ride? These people have incredible stories\n\nTuchman talked to a 28-year-old woman named Genesis Figueroa from Venezuela who traveled for a month and a half by foot, bus and boat to get to Eagle Pass with her husband.\n\n“I got very tired. My legs hurt and I got sick,” she told Tuchman in Spanish. “I came down with pneumonia. I was hospitalized for three days in Guatemala.” Watch Tuchman’s report.\n\nHe also talked to cousins traveling from Venezuela; one man’s brother died during the journey after disappearing while they crossed the Rio Grande.\n\nNearly 750 migrants are known to have died at the southern border since October 2021, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez recently reported.\n\n“We left in search of a dream, but now it’s a very difficult, hard situation,” Luis Pulido told Tuchman in Spanish. He was going to get on a DC-bound bus, hoping to get off in Kentucky to be met by relatives before moving toward Chicago.\n\nWhat happens after the bus ride?\n\nA week after their bus trip, Tuchman found Pulido and his cousin in Chicago, where they had met up with relatives, were sheltered in a small, shared apartment and were looking for work in a restaurant. They likely can’t legally work for at least 180 days, according to rules posted on the US Citizenship and Immigration Services website.\n\nWatch Tuchman’s follow-up.\n\nTuchman told me Pulido and his cousin went to their first appointments, but it was mostly administrative and they are waiting for their next appearance.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a work permit\n\nGetting a work permit can take up to a year, New York City officials told CNN’s Polo Sandoval, who also reported on this issue last month.\n\nHe went to a shelter in Brooklyn and met a young couple from Venezuela, Anabel and Crisman Urbaez, who are seeking asylum.\n\nThey showed him cellphone videos from their two-month, 10-country trek, often on foot, which started in Peru and continued through jungles in Colombia and the Darien Gap linking South and Central America – all with their 6- and 9-year-olds and their dog Max.\n\nHow long does it take to settle an immigration case?\n\nIt takes years. The average time to complete an immigration case is 1,110 days, according to data maintained by Syracuse University. During that time, migrants and asylum-seekers start to build American lives.\n\nHow many will be granted asylum?\n\nLess than half of asylum applications have been granted in recent years, according to Syracuse.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, the rate of denial was over 70%, but during the first year of the Biden administration the grant rate grew to nearly 40%.\n\nWhy are so many coming from Venezuela?\n\nAlvarez wrote recently about the mass exodus from Venezuela. The United Nations says similar numbers of people are fleeing the South American country – which has suffered from years of political repression and economic unrest – as war-torn Ukraine. Around 6.8 million Venezuelans are part of this diaspora.\n\nHow many people have crossed the border this year?\n\nThere have been nearly 2 million border encounters reported by US Customs and Border Protection so far in the fiscal year that ends September 30.\n\nSome of those encounters are repeat crossers. Others have been turned away under a Trump-era Covid-19 policy the Biden administration has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to end. A fraction are seeking asylum.\n\nWhy are officials declaring states of emergency?\n\nOfficials in New York City, Illinois and Washington, DC, have declared emergencies to deal with the buses, and they have complained they have no idea when or where to expect them, and they want warning from Texas, Arizona and now Florida.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million and bused around 9,000 migrants up north.\n\nOverall, the buses and now planes have moved thousands of migrants, but it’s a small fraction of the nearly 700,000 pending asylum applications slowly working through the justice system.\n\nThese stories are all unique, but so many of them share the theme of fleeing a home without opportunity and being comparatively happy for the trip inside the US from the border.", "authors": ["Zachary B.

Even when it started to play out people thought it was part of the theater of it. Nobody knew the severity until they told us to move back, about two to three minutes.”\n\nMan tells police 'Shoot me,' then slashes own throat\n\nSteve Knowlton, a son of the woman, told the Associated Press on Wednesday that his father, Gary, witnessed the shooting and is \"devastated.\" He said his parents had been married for 55 years.\n\nOf the officer involved, Steve Knowlton added, \"I forgive him ... There's too much hate in this world, in America. We always feel like we need revenge and it doesn't solve anything.\"\n\nLt. Katie Heck, public information officer for the Punta Gorda police, said the department has run the \"shoot/don’t shoot\" scenarios as part of its program for about two years.\n\n\"We have done them for the last two Leadership Charlotte police nights, Punta Gorda Citizen’s Academy, and then this was the first police night hosted by our Chamber of Commerce,\" she said. \"In each session four individuals went through the scenarios with no injuries or incident.\"\n\nHoward Kunik, the Punta Gorda city manager, read a statement Wednesday to reporters at a gathering attended by the mayor and city council members. \"We are shocked by this horrific accident and are grieving deeply over Mary's passing,\" he said.\n\nKunik said one of the city's first priorities was to involve the police department’s chaplain \"to provide assistance and comfort.\"\n\nKnowlton's Facebook page says she was originally from Austin, Minn., and lived in Punta Gorda.\n\nCarolyn Hartwigsen, of Edina, Minn., told the Associated Press that she was a longtime friend of Knowlton.

Tsunami waves were also recorded thousands of miles away along the United States’ West Coast, in Peru, New Zealand and Japan. In Peru, at least two people died after being swept up by high waves.\n\nAt least two deaths have been reported and aid organizations are concerned about contaminated air and access to clean water for people in Tonga’s outlying islands.\n\nWith communications down, Australia and New Zealand sent flights to survey the damage.\n\nHere’s what we know about the eruption and fallout.\n\nWhere is Tonga’s Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano?\n\nTonga is a Polynesian country of more than 170 South Pacific islands and home to about 100,000 people. It’s a remote archipelago that lies about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east of Fiji and 2,380 kilometers (1,500 miles) from New Zealand.\n\nThe Hunga-Tonga-Hunga-Ha’apai volcano, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of Tonga’s Fonuafo’ou island, sits underwater between two small islands at about 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) high from the sea floor, with about 100 meters (328 feet) visible above sea level.\n\nResearchers said it has erupted regularly over the past few decades.\n\nIn 2009, an eruption sent plumes of steam and ash into the air and formed new land above the water, and an eruption in January 2015 created a new island about 2 kilometers wide – effectively joining up Hunga-Tonga and Hunga-Ha’apai islands.\n\nThe most recent eruption began in December 2021, with gas, steam, and ash plumes rising about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) into the air. The volcano erupted again on January 14 and a massive eruption on January 15 sent shockwaves around the world and triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific.\n\nWhere did the tsunami hit?\n\nThe eruption caused a tsunami on Tonga’s largest island, Tongatapu, with waves recorded at 1.2 meters (about 4 feet) near Nuku’alofa city flowing onto coastal roads and flooding properties on Saturday.\n\nTsunami warnings went into effect across Pacific Island nations including Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu. Footage from the ground in Fiji shows people fleeing to higher ground in the capital, Suva, as large waves hit the coast.\n\nA tsunami has hit Tonga's largest island, Tongatapu. @sakakimoana/Twitter\n\nTsunami warnings and advisories were also issued from parts of New Zealand, Japan and Peru, to the United States and Canada’s British Columbia.\n\nIn Japan, the northeastern prefecture of Iwate saw waves as high as 2.7 meters (9 feet) and multiple smaller tsunamis were reported in numerous other locations, according to public broadcaster NHK. By Sunday afternoon, all tsunami advisories had been lifted in Japan.\n\nThe eruption also sent waves to the US West Coast, with some exceeding 3 and 4 feet in height, according to the National Weather Service office in San Diego. Tsunami waves were felt in California, Alaska and Hawaii.\n\nWhat is happening with the ash cloud?\n\nA giant volcanic ash cloud blanketed Tonga over the weekend, turning the afternoon sky dark and coating Nuku’alofa in a thick foam of volcanic dust on Saturday.\n\nSave the Children said drinking water supplies could be contaminated by the ash and smoke and the immediate concern in Tonga is for air and water safety.\n\nThe ash cloud was drifting westwards and was visible over Fiji, Vanuatu and New Caledonia on Sunday. By Monday it had reached Australia’s Queensland, according to the state’s meteorological service.\n\n“If you noticed a particularly stunning sunrise, it was the sunlight being scattered by #Volcanic ash from the eruption over in #Tonga,” Queensland’s Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.\n\nThe ash prevented an Australian reconnaissance flight from departing to assess the damage in the early hours of January 17, though the flight did take off later that morning.\n\nPowerful undersea volcano eruption in Tonga on January 14. Tonga Geological Services/EyePress/Reuters\n\nSeveral flights from Australia, New Zealand and Fiji to Tonga were postponed due to the ash cloud.\n\nEarly data suggests the volcanic eruption was the biggest since the 1991 blast at Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, New Zealand-based volcanologist Shane Cronin told Radio New Zealand.\n\n“This is an eruption best witnessed from space,” Cronin said, according to Reuters.\n\n“The large and explosive lateral spread of the eruption suggests that it was probably the biggest one since about the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo,” Cronin said.\n\nWhat is the scale of devastation?\n\nAt least two people, including a British national who lived in Nuku’alofa, were killed in Tonga following the eruption and tsunami.\n\nThe first images to emerge of the aftermath on January 18 show a thick layer of ash covering entire communities, but the extent of the damage remains unknown as communications – particularly on the outlying islands – have not yet been reestablished.\n\nTonga “needs immediate assistance to provide its citizens with fresh drinking water and food,” the country’s Speaker of the House Lord Fakafanua said in a statement posted to social media.\n\nHe said “many areas” had been affected by “substantial volcanic ashfall” but “the full extent of the harm to lives and property is currently unknown.”\n\nNew Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on January 16 that tsunami waves had a “significant impact” on Nuku’alofa, with boats and large boulders washed ashore. “Shops along the coast have been damaged and a significant cleanup will be needed,” she said.\n\nThe main undersea communications cable has also been impacted, likely due to loss of power.\n\nAustralia’s Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, said there was “significant property damage” in Tonga, including to roads and houses. He said there is still “very limited, if any” information coming from the outer islands.\n\nNew Zealand’s High Commission in Nuku’alofa echoed this, saying in a statement Monday that “significant” damage has been reported along the western coast of Tongatapu.\n\nA family-owned beach resort located on Tongatapu also said the business had been destroyed. “It’s with sadness to say that our beautiful home Ha’atafu beach resort has been completely wiped out. The whole western coastline has been completely destroyed along with Kanukupolu village,” the Ha’atafu Beach Resort posted on Facebook on Monday.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said its teams are on the ground and have enough supplies in the country to support 1,200 households.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Video shows eruption that caused tsunami waves 01:37 - Source: CNN\n\n“From what little updates we have, the scale of the devastation could be immense, especially for outer lying islands,” said Katie Greenwood, IFRC’s Pacific Head of Delegation, according to Reuters.\n\nNew Zealand’s Defense Force dispatched an Orion aircraft for Tonga on a surveillance mission to assess the damage. Ardern said the country has committed an initial $340,000 in relief supplies, technical support, and supporting local responses.\n\nAustralia said it is preparing for additional support, with a plane loaded with humanitarian supplies such as water and sanitation kits, ready to deliver to Tonga once conditions allow.\n\nChina and the self-ruled island of Taiwan said in separate statements they are willing to provide assistance at Tonga’s request.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this timeline incorrectly stated the number of times the volcano erupted.

Only God knows the value of his sacrifices for the good of the church,” Francis added.\n\nBenedict, who was the first pontiff in almost 600 years to resign his position, rather than hold office for life, passed away on Saturday, according to a statement from the Vatican.\n\n“With sorrow I inform you that the Pope Emeritus, Benedict XVI, passed away today at 9:34 in the Mater Ecclesiae Monastery in the Vatican,” the Director of the Press Office of the Holy See, Matteo Bruni said.\n\nFrancis went to see Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI soon after he passed away Saturday morning, according to Bruni.\n\nThe funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI will be held on Thursday in St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican City at 9:30 a.m. local time, Bruni said. The funeral will be led by Pope Francis.\n\nThe former pope’s body will lie in state in St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican from Monday for the faithful to bid farewell, Vatican News reported. As per the wish of Pope Emeritus, his funeral will be “simple,” Bruni said.\n\nThe funeral of the former pope, pictured on December 25, 2007, will take place on January 5. Alessandra Tarantino/AP\n\nNews of Benedict’s death came days after Pope Francis asked the faithful to pray for him, saying he was “very sick.”\n\nHis health had been in decline for some time.\n\nBenedict stunned the Catholic faithful and religious experts around the world on February 11, 2013, when he announced plans to step down from his position as Pope, citing his “advanced age.”\n\nIn his farewell address, the outgoing pope promised to stay “hidden” from the world, but he continued to speak out on religious matters in the years following his retirement, contributing to tensions within the Catholic Church.\n\nA powerful and polarizing voice\n\nBenedict was a powerful force in the Catholic Church for decades. Born Joseph Ratzinger in Germany in 1927, he was the son of a policeman. He was ordained as a priest in 1951, made a cardinal in 1977, and later served as chief theological adviser to Pope John Paul II.\n\nOne of his most significant steps up came in 1981 when he took over as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith, the Vatican office that oversees “the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world,” according to the Vatican.\n\nRatzinger became known as “Cardinal No” stemming from his efforts to crack down on the liberation theology movement, religious pluralism, challenges to traditional teachings on issues such as homosexuality, and calls to ordain women as priests.\n\nHe was elected pope in April 2005, following John Paul II’s death.\n\nHe was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis, who has made moves to soften the Vatican’s position on abortion and homosexuality, as well as doing more to deal with the sexual abuse crisis that has engulfed the church in recent years and clouded Benedict’s legacy.\n\nThe former pope, pictured on September 9, 2007, was known to be more conservative than his successor, Pope Francis. Robert Jaeger/AP\n\nIn April 2019, Benedict discussed the sex abuse crisis in a public letter, claiming that it was caused in part by the sexual revolution of the 1960s and the liberalization of the church’s moral teachings.\n\nIn January 2020, Benedict was forced to distance himself from a book widely seen as undercutting Francis as he considered whether or not to allow married men to become priests in certain cases. The book, “From the Depths of Our Hearts,” argued in favor of the centuries-old tradition of priestly celibacy within the Catholic Church. Benedict was originally listed as co-author, but later clarified that he had only contributed one section of the text.\n\nA year later, Benedict came under fire over his time as archbishop of Munich and Freising, between 1977 and 1982, following the publication of a Church-commissioned report into abuse by Catholic clergy there.\n\nThe report found that while in the post he had been informed of four cases of sexual abuse involving minors – including two that had occurred during his time in office – but failed to act. It also revealed Benedict had attended a meeting about an abuser identified as Priest X. Following the report’s publication, Benedict pushed back against accusations that he knew in 1980 that this priest was an abuser.\n\nIn a letter released by the Vatican amid the furor, Benedict wrote that he was “of good cheer” as he faced “the final judge of my life,” despite his shortcomings. He also issued a general apology to survivors of abuse.\n\n‘Giant of faith and reason’\n\nGlobal leaders paid homage to the former pope, following his death. Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Church of England, said he is “mourning” the former pope.\n\n“Pope Benedict was one of the greatest theologians of his age – committed to the faith of the Church and stalwart in its defence,” Welby said in a statement Saturday.\n\n“In all things, not least in his writing and his preaching, he looked to Jesus Christ, the image of the invisible God. It was abundantly clear that Christ was the root of his thought and the basis of his prayer.\n\n“In 2013 Pope Benedict took the courageous and humble step to resign the papacy, the first Pope to do so since the fifteenth century. In making this choice freely he acknowledged the human frailty that affects us all,” he added.\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of New York, said he will remember the former pope with “love and gratitude.”\n\n“Saddened to learn of the demise of His Holiness Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI,” European Parliament President Roberta Metsola tweeted Saturday.\n\n“Europe mourns him. May he rest in peace.”\n\nThe leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, on Saturday told Pope Francis he had received news of Benedict’s passing with “sorrow,” according to the message shared on the official website of the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\n“His Holiness’s many years of life marked a whole epoch in the history of the Roman Catholic Church, which he led in a difficult historical period, associated with many external and internal challenges,” Kirill said of Benedict.\n\nKirill added relations between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church had “developed significantly” during Benedict’s tenure, in an effort to “overcome the sometimes-painful legacy of the past.”\n\n“On behalf of the Russian Orthodox Church, I express my condolences to you and the flock of the Roman Catholic Church,” he continued.\n\nThe Dalai Lama on Sunday offered his condolences to the members of the Catholic Church after Benedict’s death.\n\n“I pray for our spiritual brother,” he wrote, “and offer my condolences to the members of the Catholic Church.”\n\n“At a time when we are seeing tension in several parts of the world, we can take a lesson from the life of Pope Benedict and do what we can to contribute to religious harmony and global peace.”\n\nUS President Joe Biden said the late pontiff “will be remembered as a renowned theologian, with a lifetime of devotion to the Church, guided by his principles and faith.”\n\nBiden, the second Catholic to serve as President of the United States, reflected on his meeting with Benedict at the Vatican in 2011, saying he remembered “his generosity and welcome as well as our meaningful conversation.”\n\n“As he remarked during his 2008 visit to the White House, ‘the need for global solidarity is as urgent as ever, if all people are to live in a way worthy of their dignity.’ May his focus on the ministry of charity continue to be an inspiration to us all,” Biden added.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also paid tribute. “I am saddened to learn of the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI,” Sunak tweeted Saturday.\n\n“He was a great theologian whose UK visit in 2010 was an historic moment for both Catholics and non-Catholics throughout our country.\n\nGlobal leaders have paid homage to the former German-born pope, pictured on September 12, 2006. Jens Meyer/AP\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury hailed the former Pope, pictured on November 30, 2005, as \"one of the greatest theologians of his age.\" Plinio Lepri/AP\n\nItaly’s new Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni voiced her admiration for the former pope. “Benedict XVI was a giant of faith and reason. He put his life at the service of the universal Church and spoke, and will continue to speak, to the hearts and minds of men with the spiritual, cultural and intellectual depth of his Magisterium,” she tweeted Saturday.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, who is leading Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, called the former pope “a staunch defender of traditional Christian values.”", "authors": ["Jack Guy Valentina Di Donato Sugam Pokharel Sharon Braithwaite James Frater Allegra Goodwin", "Jack Guy", "Valentina Di Donato", "Sugam Pokharel", "Sharon Braithwaite", "James Frater", "Allegra Goodwin"], "publish_date": "2022/12/31"}]}

Dan McKee, who said he wanted to showcase what the state has done to support offshore wind. The first offshore wind farm in the nation, a 30-megawatt demonstration project, was installed in state waters off Block Island five years ago. And the state has signed on for another 400 megawatts of capacity from a much larger wind farm known as Revolution Wind planned far off the coast.\n\nSouth Fork wind farm:With federal approval, construction could begin early next year\n\nThe aim, he said, is for Rhode Island to serve as the “base camp” for the industry’s supply chain. Already, Ørsted, the Danish company partnering with utility Eversource on the South Fork and Revolution proposals as well as another off New York, has opened offices in Providence. So too, the governor added, has GEV Wind, a turbine-maintenance company headquartered in England.\n\n“We were the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution,” he said, pointing to Slater Mill in Pawtucket. “And now we’re going to be the birthplace of the wind revolution.”\n\nGranholm applauded Rhode Island for what’s been done so far.\n\n“This is the poster child for how we want to do this on the coasts,” she said. “This is the way it should be.”\n\nThe $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill signed into law by President Biden last month is expected to boost offshore wind by setting aside money for research and development and for upgrading transmission lines that deliver energy to cities and states. The Build Back Better legislation under consideration in Congress would do more by providing additional tax credits for renewable energy.\n\nGranholm focused her comments on the economic benefits of clean energy. Referring to her recent participation in the global talks on climate change in Glasgow, she said that countries around the world have adopted goals of getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\n“They need the products to be able to do that,” she said. “That’s obviously wind turbines, but it’s a bunch of other products, too.

The project would be located approximately 15 miles south of Martha's Vineyard.\n\n\"The additional requirements that BOEM posed to the Vineyard project developers made us believe that it was wiser to wait to see how the outcome would be and which additional studies we should include in the construction and operation plan filing,\" Vitale said.\n\nVineyard Wind LLC., the company developing the Vineyard Wind Farm submitted its construction and operation plan in December 2017 and it remains under review two years later, according to BOEM's website.\n\nLast summer BOEM decided to hold off on approving the Vineyard Wind project, saying it wanted more time to study the wider affects of offshore wind on the environment, according to WBUR, an NPR affiliate in Boston.\n\nIn a statement to Delmarva Now, BOEM said the federal agency received comments from \"stakeholders and cooperating agencies\" that the Vineyard Wind project needed more analysis.\n\n\"This comprehensive analysis is intended to help better address potential conflicts with other ocean uses, such as commercial fishing and navigation,\" according to an emailed statement from BOEM.\n\nIn order to build a wind farm off the United States wind developers have to submit a construction and operation plan to BOEM, according to the agency's website. Once the federal agency receives the plan it conducts a technical and environmental review and decides whether to approve, approve with modifications or deny the COP plan.\n\nBOEM is also part of the reason why Ørsted has delayed its Skipjack project.\n\nØrsted says BOEM hasn't issued a Notice of Intent for the Skipjack Wind Farm, according to a statement from Ørsted. The notice would allow the project to continue through the construction review process. Without it the company can't continue developing its proposed wind farm.\n\nMore details about the delay were available in a Ørsted investor report released Wednesday. In the report the company states it's not \"realistic\" to expect the U.S. government to issue Ørsted a Notice of Intent within the timeframe needed to complete the Skipjack project by 2022.\n\n\"Our offshore development projects in the U.S. are moving forward, although at a slower pace than originally expected due to a combination of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's prolonged analysis of the cumulative impacts from the build-out of U.S. offshore wind projects,\" according to the company report.\n\nIn response to the claims made by Ørsted, BOEM said the agency is reviewing Ørsted's proposed construction plan for \"completeness and sufficiency,\" according to an emailed statement from BOEM.\n\n\"After determining that the COP is complete and sufficient, BOEM will initiate an environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe agency didn't have any details of when the review could be completed, according to the statement. However, it did say it can take two years from the time the federal government issues its Notice of Intent to complete an environmental review and thoroughly review a wind developer's plans.\n\nMatthew Prensky is the Ocean City News Reporter for Delmarva Now.

In 2019, an administrator with the National Marine Fisheries Service questioned whether BOEM was considering the full effects on fishermen from Vineyard Wind and the half-dozen other offshore wind leases on either side of it.\n\nHawkins and her organization say that the Record of Decision reflects inconsistencies in how federal officials have treated the fishing industry in connection to offshore wind development. In its written response to the Record of Decision, RODA criticized the government’s approach as “scattershot, partisan and opaque.”\n\nPlacement of turbines raises concerns\n\nOne of the biggest areas of concern for fishermen has been how developers lay out their turbines. In response to complaints from the fishing industry, Vineyard Wind and other developers agreed to orient its turbines in east-west rows and space them one nautical mile apart to try to address the concerns about navigation.\n\nBut fishermen also want developers to set aside space for wider transit lanes to allow vessels to easily get through wind farms to fishing grounds farther offshore. Vineyard Wind and the other developers have balked at agreeing to lanes that RODA and other fishing groups have called for being four nautical miles wide.\n\nThe Record of Decision cites Vineyard Wind’s concerns that the creation of transit lanes would lead to project delays. The decision also notes that such delays would be inconsistent with an executive order signed by President Joe Biden to double offshore wind by 2030.\n\n“Primary concerns with the inclusion of a transit lane focused on the precedent that may be set with the addition of transit lanes that would limit the potential of offshore wind leases to meet state demand and reduce economic benefits from offshore wind development,” the decision says.\n\nAdequate compensation for fishing industry?\n\nOf course, if fishermen completely abandon areas because of the navigation challenges posed by the construction of offshore wind farms, it would raise uncomfortable questions for regulators and developers about the adequacy of compensation packages offered to the fishing industry.\n\nFor example, the terms of the agreement that Vineyard Wind made with the Fishermen’s Advisory Board in Rhode Island to create two compensation funds totaling $16.7 million does not specifically contemplate fishermen leaving the project area altogether.\n\nIn talks over compensation for the South Fork Wind Farm, the second project in the federal permitting queue, the Rhode Island fishermen’s board hit an impasse with developers Orsted and Eversource this past winter because the two sides couldn’t agree on the extent of impacts to fisheries.\n\nStaff at the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council are preparing a recommendation on whether to approve certification for the 132-megawatt project, in time for a vote that is set to take place May 25, and are taking into account fisheries impacts.\n\nThe Army Corps statement would seem to bolster the fishermen’s argument that the effects will be far-reaching. Orsted did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHawkins said that it should be up to the federal government to come up with a consistent approach on fishing issues, including in regard to compensation.\n\n“There needs to be a federal, regional approach to determining impact fees based on the full value of losses,” she said. “So far we have not seen BOEM do a single thing to support fair compensation, although we've asked for it for years and years.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/06/carneys-offshore-wind-task-forces-gets-work/738758001/", "title": "Bloom Energy struggles loom over Delaware offshore wind talks", "text": "Delaware took another tentative step Friday toward a possible offshore wind farm.\n\nA 19-member advisory panel recently created by Gov. John Carney held its first meeting to examine how the state could participate in a recent boom of offshore wind projects along the East Coast.\n\nBut not all of the working group's members are convinced such a project would be in the state's best interests.\n\nState Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, warned his fellow task force members against rushing headlong into a conclusion without considering all the potential pitfalls – an approach he later compared to the 2011 deal with Bloom Energy that has cost ratepayers roughly $150 million.\n\nDelaware approved that surcharge on Delmarva Power bills and a host of other incentives that brought Bloom Energy to Newark along with the promise of 900 high-paying jobs. To date, more than half of those jobs have yet to materialize.\n\n\"We really need to do our due diligence to make sure we're not forcing a project into life because we want it to come,\" he said. \"We should do it if it makes sense and not because we dream or wish the benefits were true.\"\n\nRELATED:Marijuana legalization foes ask Delaware task force for concessions\n\nRELATED:Delaware school district task force takes open-ended approach\n\nHashing out those details in the time allowed could prove challenging. The working group on Friday agreed to hold at least four more meetings and two public workshops between now and its Dec. 11 deadline for submitting a final report to the governor.\n\n\"What we're trying to get out of this is some direction so we know what we're trying to pursue and how we have to go about that,\" said DNREC Secretary Shawn Garvin. \"There will be a whole lot of work to do after we develop the report.\"\n\nOne of the major obstacles faced by the working group will be to determine whether Delaware would be better served by a full-scale project of its own or by piggybacking on a pair of offshore wind farms recently approved in the waters off of Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nU.S. Wind, a subsidiary of an Italian construction firm, is planning to build 62 turbines 17 miles off the coast, while Skipjack Offshore Energy is looking to add another 15. Together, those projects are expected to produce 368 megawatts of carbon-free energy to Maryland customers.\n\n\"There's a lot more room in the territory where they're building these wind turbines,\" said Bruce Burcat, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition and chair of Carney's working group. \"One concept is to potentially work with those companies and see if we can benefit from that.\"\n\nWorking group member Collin O'Mara noted the benefits of an offshore wind generation could extend well beyond increasing Delaware's supply of renewable energy with a single project.\n\n\"There's an opportunity to do both manufacturing and build a bunch of jobs at the port,\" said the former DNREC secretary who now heads the National Wildlife Foundation. \"And because we're positioned centrally ... you could create a hub here. It's a huge, huge opportunity.\"\n\nDelaware officials had visions of landing those same jobs a decade ago.\n\nIn 2008, Delmarva Power became the first utility in the country to sign a deal to buy offshore wind power. That electricity would have been produced by NRG Bluewater Wind, a company that planned to build dozens of turbines that would have generated about 200 megawatts, or enough to power 54,000 homes.\n\nNRG Bluewater Wind even won the first lease issued by the Interior Department for an offshore wind farm about 13 miles off the coast. But the project fell apart in 2011 after certain federal loan guarantees and financing failed to materialize.\n\nNRG has since sold its federal lease to a partnership between Deepwater Wind and PSE&G that is currently pursuing a wind farm off New Jersey's coast.\n\nDeepwater Wind is the same company that last year began operating the five-turbine Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island. The business also is one of the two companies approved to build wind turbines off the coast of Maryland.\n\nWhile offshore wind has gained a toehold on the East Coast, those projects have come at a steep price.\n\nSome estimates have put the cost of offshore wind at three to four times that of other renewable energy sources, such as solar and onshore wind – both of which enjoy federal tax credits that have not been extended to offshore wind.\n\nOther states have helped offset those high costs by requiring utilities to purchase a portion of their electricity from offshore wind generators under lengthy contract agreements. Those deals tend to assure developers — and the banks that finance them — that the customers will be there once the project is finished.\n\nSome, like Maryland, have instituted specific hikes in the electricity rate to further help ensure those developers have a set source of income. The $1.50 per month charge imposed by Delaware's neighbor helped it land two offshore wind projects expected to be fully operational by 2022.\n\n\"Somewhere, somebody has got to pay extra money in order to get a wind farm off shore,\" said Robert Howatt, executive director of the Delaware Public Service Commission.\n\n\"How you get that money is going to be a critical piece of our discussion,\" he said. \"This could become an offshore Bloom, so to speak, and that's not where we think it would be in the best interests of the state of Delaware.\"\n\nHowatt insisted no one on the working group has any preconceived notions about whether wind power makes sense for the First State.\n\n\"We are starting off at ground zero,\" he said. \"Our hope is to consider all the issues in front of us ... and hopefully form a consensus.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/07/offshore-wind-farm-new-jersey/70389783007/", "title": "Biden administration OKs largest US offshore wind farm in New Jersey", "text": "NEPTUNE, N.J. — The federal government has approved the largest U.S. offshore wind energy project, which officials say could power hundreds of thousands of New Jersey homes with clean energy and is expected to create over 3,000 jobs through construction and development.\n\nThe Interior Department’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced its approval of Ocean Wind 1 project's plan for construction and operations Wednesday. It is New Jersey's first offshore wind energy project and will be located about 13 nautical miles southeast of Atlantic City.\n\n\"Since Day One, the Biden-Harris administration has worked to jump-start the offshore wind industry across the country — and today’s approval for the Ocean Wind 1 project is another milestone in our efforts to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation,\" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said the announcement marked a \"pivotal inflection point\" in the state's transition toward carbon-free power.\n\nDeveloped by Denmark-based power company Ørsted, the Ocean Wind 1 project will generate enough electricity that could power up to 500,000 homes with nearly 100 wind turbines off the coast of southern New Jersey.\n\nThe project's approval marks a milestone for the American offshore wind sector, as the country lags behind offshore wind farm operations in Europe and Asia. It is the third commercial-scale offshore wind energy project in the United States to be approved by the Biden administration.\n\nOcean Wind 1 joins two other projects, the Vineyard Wind project in Massachusetts and the South Fork Wind project in New York, both of which are now under construction. Ørsted plans to have tall structures that will support wind turbines, called monopiles, installed in 2024 and to begin commercial operations in 2025.\n\nBut offshore wind has become a source of controversy in New Jersey, pitting politicians against one another down party lines and even dividing some environmental groups over its potential marine impacts.\n\nOcean Wind 1 construction to begin in the fall\n\nState and federal officials are moving ahead with approvals. Last week, the New Jersey Legislature voted to allow Ørsted to collect federal tax credits aimed at offshore wind farms. The bill is awaiting the governor's signature.\n\nMurphy said BOEM's approval brings New Jersey a step closer toward its green energy goals.\n\n\"As we continue to cultivate burgeoning new industries while confronting the worsening climate crisis, our state’s first offshore wind project will generate thousands of good-paying union jobs and considerable environmental benefits for generations to come,\" he said.\n\nOcean Wind 1's approval includes a provision for a commercial fisheries compensation program, according to BOEM. The fund will offer reimbursement for lost revenue, a safety fund for navigational equipment, and money for lost or damaged fishing gear.\n\nFederal officials said Ocean Wind 1 will also have to adhere to regulations designed to protect endangered and threatened marine animals, including enforcing vessel speed limits and funding various animal monitoring programs.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in the fall as Ørsted plans on “delivering on the promise of good-paying jobs, local investment and clean energy,” said David Hardy, the company’s CEO for the Americas.\n\nØrsted plans to begin laying electrical transmission cable and building onshore electrical substations. Monopiles are also being welded, sandblasted and painted at EEW American Offshore Structures’ facility at the Port of Paulsboro across the Delaware River from Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nOffshore wind farm battle:How dead whales became the symbol of a political battle in NJ and elsewhere\n\nProject proponents and critics divided over marine impacts\n\nProponents of offshore wind say climate change is a dangerous threat to New Jersey's marine and coastal ecosystems as well as millions of residents. Warming oceans will lead to worse storms and more frequent flooding; ocean acidification that will kill marine animals; and disruptions in migration routes and feeding and breeding areas.\n\nWarming ocean temperatures could also slow down critical circulation currents within the Atlantic Ocean and lead to changes in how heat moves between the equator and poles, potentially changing climates across portions of the Earth, according to NASA.\n\nBecause of these threats, proponents have said reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas through the transition to carbon-free energy is an essential part of slowing climate change and protecting critical ecosystems around the world.\n\nBut critics of offshore wind say the construction of wind farms will kill marine animals and disrupt the migrations of whales and other species. Offshore wind farms will also place thousands of acres of important fishing grounds off limits and destroy livelihoods in the fisheries business, according to critics.\n\nOpponents of the project are not giving up their efforts to stop Ocean Wind 1 from being constructed.\n\nEarlier this month, three New Jersey organizations — Save LBI, Defend Brigantine Beach and Protest Our Coast NJ — filed a lawsuit in state Superior Court to stop construction of the project.\n\nOcean Wind 1 will harm \"one of the most important marine communities on the East Coast and the core of New Jersey's $47 billion tourist industry,\" said Bruce Afran, an attorney for the three groups.\n\nUS offshore wind sector:The next few months will be big for offshore wind in America, and RI is playing a key role\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nAmanda Oglesby is an Ocean County native who covers Brick, Barnegat and Lacey townships as well as the environment.

It's possible that some turbines would be visible, given very clear conditions and depending on the final height of the structures, from the Atlantic Ocean bluffs in Truro.\n\nOn Thursday, Cape & Islands Municipal Leaders Association President Douglas Brown said the first formal presentation the organization had about the plans for the Gulf of Maine was at its annual meeting on Martha's Vineyard on June 14.\n\n\"A couple of days before the meeting, I got an email from somebody at BOEM, and he asked if they could join us,\" he said.\n\nThat's when the region's leaders first realized as a group how much of a stake the region has, he said.\n\n\"They came in and they showed us the lease areas,\" Brown said. \"Somebody after the meeting came over and said 'wow, that's awfully close to Cape Cod, not like I expected it to be for the Gulf of Maine.\"\n\nHe said despite some notices from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management prior to June about the impending \"Gulf of Maine\" proposed sale notice, many missed a full understanding of just how far the area extended. In his mind, the Gulf ends at the top of Cape Cod, and the waters east of the Cape are open Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\"I guess it (the Gulf) ends in Chatham now,\" he said.\n\nSix of the eight proposed lease areas \"are closer to Cape Cod than they are to Maine,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know when there was a BOEM meeting about this on Cape Cod,\" Brown said. \"There's a lot of stuff that we need to think about and talk about it.\"\n\nThe July 22 public comment period extension the Cape Cod and Islands leaders are asking for coincides with another public comment period for a draft environmental assessment that just opened on June 21. The assessment considers site characterization surveys — such as biological, archeological, geological, and geophysical surveys and core samples — as well as installation of meteorological buoys expected to occur following issuance of leases, according to the agency.\n\nAs for the public comments on the lease sites, at this time closing July 1, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is specifically seeking feedback on various aspects of the proposed lease areas, including size, orientation and location of the eight lease areas and which areas, if any, should be prioritized for inclusion or exclusion from this year's scheduled lease sale.\n\nTo submit comments, visit Regulations.gov.

In all, Berrada companies own 292 properties with more than 3,600 units in the city. Berrada says his organization owns 8,000 rental units nationwide.\n\nHousing advocates in Milwaukee say the companies sometimes run roughshod over tenants and that they are using small claims court as a collection agency. The approximately 75 firms owned by or linked to Berrada — most of them limited liability companies — were behind more than one out of every 10 eviction cases filed last year in the county, a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis found.\n\nRELATED:Landlord Games\n\nSoon after a Berrada LLC bought Young's building on the 5300 block of North 29th Street, the company began renovation work. When Young went to the basement to check her belongings kept in a locked storage area she was shocked to see just how aggressive the workers had been.\n\nEverything was gone, Young said.\n\nAmong the vanished belongings: The urn containing the ashes of her infant granddaughter, Miracle Young.\n\n\"I just sat on the stairs and cried,\" Young said. \"I was hurt, I was devastated, there were things in there that never will be replaced, my pictures, my family pictures — my siblings' (pictures). My granddaughter's ashes.\"\n\nTrademark boulders\n\nBerrada, 49, started buying Milwaukee rental properties in the 1990s. His 18-room Mequon home sits on a 5.5-acre estate and is listed on state records as the principal office of his Berrada Properties Management Inc. The $1.6 million mansion is one of eight luxury homes across the country owned or linked to him.\n\nWhile not well known throughout the city, Berrada's presence can be felt in some neighborhoods, especially on the west and north sides — just look for the ubiquitous boulders.\n\nOr swing past Room 400 of the Milwaukee County Courthouse on just about any afternoon, where Berrada property managers negotiate in the hallway with tenants facing eviction.\n\nBerrada declined, repeatedly, to be interviewed for this story.\n\n\"I'm not a media person, I'm not a politician,\" Berrada told a reporter.\n\nHis attorney, Joe Goldberger, would only answer questions by email and began by arguing Berrada should not be the subject of any story. Goldberger said his client is \"a particularly private person and wishes to operate his business without unwelcome publicity.\"\n\nThat reticence belies the outsized influence Berrada and his companies have on the lower-income rental market in Milwaukee.\n\nSome city officials praise Berrada, saying he oversees a well-run operation that buys and rehabs neighborhood eyesores. Others express anguish over his companies' aggressive dealings with tenants, particularly through assembly-line evictions.\n\nEven if a tenant agrees to a payment plan and follows it, the original eviction lawsuit almost always remains on the tenant's public record. That can continue to haunt them, hobbling efforts to find new places to live.\n\n\"A lot of landlords will deny housing to anyone who has been sued for eviction, regardless of the outcome of the case,\" said Eric Dunn, litigation director for the National Housing Law Project.\n\nOf Berrada, Ald. Russell Stamper, himself a landlord, said: \"He runs a tight ship. He'll evict you in a minute.\"\n\nBerrada companies filed at least 1,637 eviction lawsuits last year, or 11.6 percent of the 14,157 filed countywide, records shows. On one day alone — Jan. 30, 2017 — Berrada companies filed 99 eviction actions.\n\nThat was one of a dozen days last year when Berrada companies filed at least 40 evictions.\n\n\"That’s a pretty disproportionate amount,\" Dunn said.\n\nSome of Berrada's tactics are raising red flags with advocacy groups and attorneys who work with low-income renters. For example:\n\nRepeat actions: Berrada entities repeatedly file eviction actions against the same tenant, often ending each case with an agreement, or stipulation, demanding the tenant pay back rent, court costs and late payment fines. Berrada companies routinely fine tenants $100 when they are 10 days late on rent. Failure to make the stipulation payments on time could result in an eviction.\n\nSome Berrada tenants are sued for eviction as many four times in a year, records show.\n\n\"It's using the court system as a mode of collection,\" said Karen Dardy, chief staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee. \"It's a terrible abuse. I don't think it is illegal; I think it's very unethical.\"\n\nProblematic leases: The state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection has issued five warning letters since 2015 questioning whether Berrada companies were violating state landlord-tenant law. In two cases — November 2017 and June 2018 — Berrada Properties was warned that a lease is void if it \"requires payment by the tenant of attorney fees or costs in any legal action or dispute arising from the rental agreement.\"\n\nRequiring tenants to pay legal costs in eviction cases \"was a part of the standard lease — even though it is prohibited,\" said Raphael Ramos, director of the Eviction Defense Project in Milwaukee.\n\nNo follow-up action was taken by the state, and \"Berrada has not provided any additional correspondence, or assurance, regarding those matters,\" agency spokesman Jerad Albracht said in an email.\n\nAsked whether Berrada companies have changed their practices in response to the warning letters, Goldberger wrote: \"As necessary, corrective measures are undertaken on a timely basis.\"\n\nQuick move-outs: When a Berrada company buys a building, it sometimes wants tenants who are on month-to-month leases to move out within 30 days, so the property can be rehabbed, according to tenants and state records.\n\n\"It puts people in harm's way,\" said Preston Cole, commissioner of the city Department of Neighborhood Services. \"I'm concerned, the mayor is concerned. It creates more families that are being dislocated. It creates more trauma.\"\n\nGoldberger said decisions on whether to move tenants out when a building is purchased are made on a case-by-case basis. When moves are necessary, he said, Berrada officials work with the tenants to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nBad for her health\n\nIn Young's case, she was not asked to leave — though she now she wishes she had left before the rehab work began last year.\n\nYoung said that during the rehab work, the front door of her apartment was barricaded for a day, trapping her inside. She couldn't use the back exit because of recently poured cement and ongoing construction, she said.\n\n\"I have lung issues and the dust was entering into my apartment,\" said Young, 59. \"I couldn't get out of my apartment.\"\n\nIn addition to Young, another tenant of a Berrada property complained to state regulators that workers screwed her front door shut last year while she was inside. The tenant called the Fire Department to have the door opened, city and state records show.\n\nIn an email, Berrada attorney Goldberger denied \"that Ms. Young, or for that matter, any of its tenants, have been 'locked' in an apartment.\"\n\n\"I started getting depressed,\" said Young, who was unemployed and on rent assistance. \"I started getting sick.\"\n\nYoung had leg surgery in 2016 and suffers from several chronic conditions including heart and lung disease, chronic pain and vascular disease, according to letters written by health care providers she provided to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\"The construction that is occurring in her apartment has significantly affected her health,\" her physician, Brian Hilgeman, wrote in a 2017 letter to help Young break her lease. \"Her anxiety is much worse and her breathing has worsened.\"\n\nAccess to her apartment in April 2017 was difficult, according to a letter from Jennifer McClain, a nurse with MyChoice Family Care, written as Young was pursuing legal action.\n\n\"The door was blocked by construction materials, and we had to knock on Ms. Young's window to announce our arrival,\" McClain wrote. \"When Ms. Young's family member answered the door, the construction materials had to be moved aside and the door could only be opened a small degree to allow entry into apartment building.\"\n\nShe noted the grass near the entry \"was dug up, uneven, and a fall risk.\"\n\nYoung twice sued Berrada Properties for throwing out her belongings. The first lawsuit was dismissed on a technicality. The second suit was heading for trial until April, when Berrada Properties Management agreed to pay Young $5,000 to settle, said attorney Amanda Adrian, who represented Young through Legal Aid.\n\nGoldberger told the Journal Sentinel that sometimes Berrada Properties will make the \"business decision\" to settle a lawsuit. Adrian said the company did not initially treat it as a nuisance settlement.\n\n\"They were really fighting us,\" she said. \"It's amazing how hard they fight over relatively small amounts of money.\"\n\nRELATED: Poor? Need legal aid? Tiny part of landlord law could make lawyers wary of helping out\n\nDesiree Rodriguez, a school bus driver, was hit with an eviction suit last year by a Berrada company, but later won a $3,400 default judgment against a Berrada company, which she said did not return her security deposit. The company quickly sought a do-over.\n\nIn June, Rodriguez won round two when Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Laura Gramling Perez rejected a motion by Berrada Properties 22 LLC to reopen the case. The company has since paid her the $3,400.\n\n\"He just seems to be going around buying a ton of stuff — and a ton of boulders,\" Rodriguez said.\n\nLast year, Berrada entities filed 670 more evictions than they filed in 2016; countywide the increase for all landlords was just 685. Berrada companies went from filing 2.5 percent of all evictions in the county in 2013 to 5.7 percent in 2015.\n\nThe Berrada filings in 2017 included 265 so-called serial filings — that is, suits filed against the same person on multiple occasions, the Journal Sentinel found.\n\nTen tenants were hit with eviction suits filed by Berrada companies four times, 55 were sued three times and more than 200 received two eviction actions.\n\n\"If you're renting a place for $600 and you get taken to court three times, it's like you're paying an extra month's rent,\" because of the fees and court costs that a tenant often agrees to pay, said Matthew Desmond, author of \"Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City\" — a Pulitzer Prize-winning book that examines evictions in Milwaukee.\n\nRELATED: Low-income households in Milwaukee squeezed by rents\n\nGoldberger said the multiple evictions are a byproduct of working with a tenant. For example, if an agreed-upon payment plan — which often includes the client paying late fees and Berrada's court costs — is not followed, it can result in additional evictions.\n\n\"That’s unfortunate, but completely understandable,\" Goldberger wrote.\n\nJeff Myer, litigation director at Legal Action of Wisconsin, said such repeat filings turn the court into the landlord's bill collector.\n\n\"They are armed with the most powerful threat government has — short of jail,\" he said of landlords. \"They can move you out of your home.\"\n\nA growing portfolio\n\nIn 2002, Berrada owned just 16 properties with a market value of about $5 million, according to documents he filed in his divorce case. Today, the 3,600 rental units Berrada's companies own cover 3.2 million square feet, roughly the size of 55 football fields. The properties have an assessed value of $137.6 million, according to city records.\n\nSince 2015, Berrada companies have bought 88 Milwaukee properties.\n\n\"Pretty soon he'll be the dominant owner of property on the near west side — if not the only property owner,\" said Ald. Robert Bauman, who represents the area.\n\nSometimes Berrada is the guy landlords in trouble turn to when they need to sell in a hurry.\n\nLast year, his companies bought seven properties from James Herrick, the River Hills millionaire and Robert W. Baird Inc. executive, who rented out dilapidated central city properties loaded with building code violations.\n\nThis year, Berrada companies picked up four properties from Elijah Mohammad Rashaed, whose properties have been effectively placed in receivership as part of the city attorney's effort to drive him out of the business.\n\nRELATED:Judge strips Milwaukee landlord Elijah Rashaed's control over his central city properties\n\nRELATED :Mystery buyer rejected for notorious landlord's properties — but judge grants more time\n\nStill, Berrada remains largely unknown in political and business circles.\n\nHe's not a big contributor to politicians, and he doesn't belong to the trade group that represents Milwaukee area landlords. Several Milwaukee power brokers shook their head when asked if they had heard of him.\n\nBerrada moved to Milwaukee in the 1986-'87 school year and attended South Milwaukee High School as a foreign exchange student. He was on the school's tennis and volleyball teams and was initiated into the National Honor Society.\n\nIn 1990, he graduated from Marquette University with a degree in engineering.\n\nDuring a brief discussion a couple of years ago, Bauman said, Berrada told him his family was involved in \"buying, rehabbing and reselling heavy construction equipment\" in Morocco and that he had some business interests in Europe.\n\nRecords show Berrada or companies linked to him paid more than $17 million to buy homes and a luxury condo in Maui; Boca Roton, Fla.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Chicago; San Diego and near Las Vegas. Included in the tab is a $1.1 million home on a 15-acre lot on the shores of Lake Michigan in Oostburg in Sheboygan County.\n\nBerrada has been known to own and tool around in pricey cars, such as a Ferrari, Bentley, BMW or Aston Martin — the car made famous in James Bond movies.\n\nHe owns a 49-foot yacht and is the president of YB Falcon Inc., a Delaware corporation that owns a Mystere Falcon 900 jet, records show. He also owns a helicopter, his ex-wife said in a 2017 court filing.\n\nLittle is known about the operation of his businesses.\n\n\"I don't even know how he does it and I was married to him,\" said Vikki Bearden-Berrada, who court records show was married to Berrada from 1991 to 2003 and lived with him from 2009 to 2017.\n\nOne of the few times Berrada's name has appeared in the news came in 2008 when Bearden-Berrada was charged with three counts of reckless endangerment for driving her Hummer on the lawn of the Mequon estate and attempting to run over her ex-husband and the couple's then 9-year-old daughter.\n\nThe incident occurred when Bearden-Berrada was served with eviction papers seeking to throw her out of a Mequon house she was renting from a Berrada company.\n\nA jury found her not guilty in 2009.\n\nBearden-Berrada knew enough about her ex-husband's finances to last year negotiate an increase in child support payments for their two teenage children from $2,500 a month to $10,000. Berrada also gave his ex-wife a 2015 BMW X5 as part of the agreement.\n\n'We work very hard'\n\nBerrada companies paid property taxes of $3.3 million last year, and Berrada paid state income tax of $114,111 in 2016, up from $13,061 in 2015, records show.\n\nBerrada operations generally make repairs that are ordered by the city in a timely manner.\n\n\"He doesn't present himself as a bad actor,\" said Cole, the commissioner of the neighborhood services department.\n\nOver the past eight years, city building inspectors have cited Berrada properties with more than 1,300 violations, ranging from the mundane to the serious. At nearly two dozen properties, inspectors found 20-plus violations each; four had more than 40 violations. Citations included inadequate heat, broken windows, lack of fire extinguishers, lack of secure, locking outside doors and infestations of rodents or bed bugs.\n\nCole said he did not know whether Berrada's reputation for aggressive evictions stops tenants from filing complaints, but noted: \"People are deathly afraid to turn in a landlord.\"\n\nIn April, Berrada appeared before a Common Council committee that was considering selling a city-owned, fire-damaged property to his operation.\n\n\"We respond to every maintenance issue, we have a good relationship with the Department of Neighborhood Services … the commissioner, he gives us good grades,\" Berrada told aldermen. \"We work very hard every day to do better.\n\n\"I feel we have a good, over 95% approval rate,\" he said, referring to audit by an unnamed company Berrada said had reviewed his operations.\n\nBerrada told the aldermen there were only about 30 vacancies in the 8,000 rental units nationwide his operation owned.\n\nAs for the boulders, Berrada said they're placed to prevent tenants from driving on the lawn.\n\nSeveral tenants, including some who were sued for eviction, said the properties were in generally in good condition and well-maintained. Others have raised complaints.\n\nIn 2015, Stephen Toliver was pleased to land an apartment in a newly purchased Berrada property on West Silver Spring Drive. Recently released from prison after doing more than 23 years following a conviction stemming from a 1991 homicide, he looked forward to moving into a renovated apartment.\n\nAt first conditions were good, Toliver said. But, after a year or so, conditions declined.\n\n\"I'd rather live in a cell,\" Toliver said. \"I kept a clean cell.\"\n\nAmong the problems, Toliver said, were insect infestations, broken doors, vandalized mailboxes and drug dealers hanging around — a claim supported by a second ex-tenant and a neighbor.\n\nToliver said he urged other residents who were voicing similar complaints to stop paying rent and complain to the city.\n\nToliver was sued for eviction last year. In court, Toliver argued he never got the notice to pay his rent or face eviction because several mailboxes in the building, including his, had been vandalized and were unusable.\n\n\"You can't get mail without a mailbox,\" said Ramos of the Eviction Project, which represented him in the case.\n\nGoldberger, the Berrada attorney, said Toliver received proper notice of the eviction. He did not respond to questions about whether the mailboxes were usable at the time. Sean Hargadon, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman, said information about the mailboxes was \"proprietary.\"\n\nToliver's name has since been sealed in the court record. Judges seldom seal a tenant's name, doing so only if the tenant can prove a flaw in the eviction, such as a lack of service or the rent really was paid.\n\nRELATED: We can solve Milwaukee's noncompetitive housing market for the poor. Here's how.\n\nSeveral months after Toliver moved out, a different tenant complained to the city about the building's condition. In March, building inspectors cited the Berrada company that owns the property for 14 violations, including missing or broken doors, holes in the walls, missing fire extinguishers and roaches.\n\nInspectors ordered the violations be fixed by April 8, but the city failed to schedule a follow-up inspection until last week — after the Journal Sentinel asked whether repairs had been made.\n\nA Journal Sentinel reporter and photographer observed two large holes in the wall in the hallway of the building when a tenant invited them into the building in May.\n\nInspectors checked the building last week and all of the ordered repairs had been made, a DNS spokesperson said.\n\nGoldberger told the Journal Sentinel the tenants who caused the damage to the property have been \"removed\" and Berrada Properties is replacing all exterior doors with \"security enhanced doors.\"\n\n\"Berrada Properties Management, Inc. has a history of promptly and fully addressing matters which result in the issuance of an order by the City,\" he wrote.\n\nBoulders everywhere\n\nOn the west side, a 28-year-old man who asked to remain anonymous said that when he and his girlfriend first moved into a Berrada building on West Wisconsin Avenue near Marquette High School, everything was fine. They liked the neighborhood, which gave the couple good access to transportation to get to their jobs.\n\nBut as time went on and things broke, service was slow or sloppy, the man said. When there was some mold in the ceiling workers simply painted it over — basically guaranteeing the mold would return. It did.\n\nSo why not move?\n\n\"Where am I going to go,\" he said, gesturing toward an area a couple blocks away on Wells Street where boulders are on the lawns of nine apartment buildings linked to Berrada in a two-block area. \"He owns everything here.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/08/04/nj-eviction-moratorium-foreclosure-moratorium-how-do-new-rules-work/5455988001/", "title": "NJ eviction, foreclosure moratoriums: How do the new protections ...", "text": "New Jersey's protections against renter evictions will soon change depending on a family's income now that Gov. Phil Murphy signed S3691 into law on Wednesday.\n\nRead on to see how long protections last, how you opt in, where you can apply for rental assistance and more:\n\nHow long does the eviction moratorium in New Jersey last now?\n\nIt depends on your income and the reason your landlord wants to evict you.\n\nYou will be protected under the new law for a while longer if you missed a rent payment, habitually made late payments or refused to pay a rent increase.\n\nIf your annual household income is above 80% of your county’s median income, but below 120%, you cannot be locked out of your home until Aug. 31, 2021, under New Jersey law.\n\nIf your annual household income is below 80% of your county’s median income, you cannot be kicked out of your home until Dec. 31, 2021, under the New Jersey law Murphy signed Wednesday.\n\nBefore Murphy signed S3691, all renters — regardless of income — were protected from lockouts through Jan. 1, 2022, except in rare cases of emergency, such as documented violence or safety concerns.\n\nNow, if you meet those income qualifications and sign a certification under penalty of perjury, you are protected, and the courts will dismiss any eviction case against you filed between March 1, 2020, and Aug. 31, 2021, if you make below 120% of your county's median income, or through Dec. 31, 2021, if you make below 80% of your county's median income, according to the governor's office.\n\nWhat if my case does not involve nonpayment of rent?\n\nEvictions can resume, now that Murphy has signed the bill, in cases that don't involve nonpayment of rent, habitual late payment or rent, or refusal to pay a rent increase within the protected period.\n\nBut there is still a process that needs to occur and a substantial backlog in court cases.\n\n\"Eviction is not something that would happen automatically the day legislation is signed,\" said Maura Sanders, chief counsel at Legal Services of New Jersey. \"For the limited number of cases where a judgment has already been entered, a landlord would have to go to court, apply for a duplicate warrant and have that served.\n\n\"All total, we're talking about a two-week process at minimum, assuming a landlord went to the courthouse right away and there were court officials available,\" Sanders said.\n\nHow do I fill out this certification?\n\nVisit covid19.nj.gov/pages/renter to submit the certification.

Landlords can file a case in civil court to recoup missed rent, but the end goal of these cases is to receive the funds, not remove you from the property.\n\nIf you have a pending case against you during that period, and you turn in the certification to the courts and your landlord, the case will be dismissed.\n\nIf you make below 80% of your county's median income and file the certification, nonpayment eviction cases between September and December 2021 will also be dismissed, according to the governor's office.\n\nDoes the law include rental assistance?\n\nYes. The bill allocates an additional $500 million to pay for past and future rent, and up to $250 million for utility payments.\n\nHow do I know if I’m eligible for this new assistance?\n\nUnder the new Eviction Prevention Program, which will be administered by the state Department of Community Affairs, you must have missed rent payments because of the pandemic.\n\nYou may be eligible whether or not you have a formal eviction complaint, and must make 120% or less of your county’s median income. The DCA may prioritize low-income households for relief.\n\nTo qualify, you must be a New Jersey resident, be under a rental agreement, have no savings that could cover your rent, and be at risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability.\n\nIf a tenant pays a landlord using rent assistance, a landlord must waive all late fees for unpaid rent.\n\nHow much money can I get from this program?\n\nIt depends on your income and situation.\n\nThe program allows a family to pay up to two years’ worth of current, past or future rent.\n\nFamilies making 30% of their county's median income or less could receive an amount that allows them to pay no more than 30% of their household income on rent.

The landlord may also be ordered to pay attorney’s fees or take actions to fix a tenant’s credit score.\n\nLandlords also could risk losing rental assistance if they don't provide a \"habitable\" apartment, such as fixing roof leaks, or keeping the heat and hot water on. If a tenant certifies to the DCA that the landlord is not providing these things, an inspector finds the claims to be true and the landlord doesn't fix the issue, he or she can lose part or all of the rental subsidy from the government.\n\nHow does this change the foreclosure moratorium in New Jersey?\n\nHomeowners cannot be foreclosed on through Nov. 15, moving up the previous deadline of Jan. 1, 2022.\n\nDoes New Jersey offer homeowner assistance?\n\nThe New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency is in the process of implementing a $325 million Homeowner Assistance Fund.

Though the final details are being hammered out ahead of the revision's first committee appearance in July, it's already being shopped around — with mixed reviews — to the city's landlords.\n\nThe training would be based on a program developed by police in Mesa, Arizona, and used nationwide. That full-day program focuses on crime prevention theory, resident screening, identifying gang and drug activity, eviction methods and working with local public safety officials.\n\nBackers of the proposed legislation say landlords are on the front line of crime because they have the ability to spot and stop drug and gang activity in the homes they own. The new rule, they say, will especially benefit newbies in the rental industry who may not know how to screen tenants before signing a lease or identify trouble after.\n\nIt's not an entirely novel concept in Delaware. In Wilmington, the housing authority is considering similar measures for the landlords who participate in its housing choice voucher program and the state's Attorney General's Office has offered the training since 2012, when late Attorney General Beau Biden promoted participation as a crime fighting effort.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nVIDEO: Millenials choose rental living over home ownership\n\nSTORY: Student's death reveals gaps in policing parties\n\n“Our message to landlords is clear – you have responsibilities to the communities where you own rental properties,” Biden said in 2012.\n\nThat’s the same message the city legislation is meant to send, said its author, at-large Councilwoman Maria Cabrera, who also uses softer signals to the landlords of safer, sturdier and more prosperous investments.\n\n“If you’re a good landlord, or if you’re a property owner, you’ve made an investment,” Cabrera said. “Who do you want living next to you? Who do you want to own those properties? If it’s not going to be a homeowner and it’s going to be a rental, don’t you want it to be someone like yourself who follows the law?”\n\nCabrera, who is running for mayor in the fall, already has heard grumbling about more regulation and wants to include some kind of incentive to make the prospect palatable for property owners.\n\nThe landlords this rule will affect are people like Brian O’Neill, who after 20 years of business owns 70 properties in Wilmington.\n\nEducation, especially for novices entering the rental game, is important for exactly the reasons the city ordinance in its current and potentially-amended form exists, O’Neill said. Spotting crime, navigating bureaucracy and finding local resources need to be taught.\n\nBut he’s a small business owner.\n\n“The term ‘mandatory’ will thwart business growth. It will end up creating a barrier for any investors to buy in the city. The city already has a bad enough rap on several fronts, why create another one?” O’Neill said.\n\nNearly 54 percent of Wilmington's housing units are rental properties, and some portions of the city have rates above 70 percent. In north New Castle County, 45 percent of residents are renters compared to just 12.5 percent in the southern half. Delaware as a whole maintains a rental rate just above 28 percent.\n\nOne of those renters is Morgan Hall, who's lived with her daughters on East 22nd Street in Wilmington for about two years. She's a Section 8 tenant and supports the plan to provide guidance to landlords.\n\n\"A lot of landlords around here could use a lot of training,\" she said.\n\nThough making a relation of causality between a large rental stock and higher or increasing crime is difficult, Regional Economist for the Center of Economic and Policy Study at the University of Virginia's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service Terance Rephann made a study of the issue because of long-held public impressions, a rise in \"absentee landlords\" and high rates of tenancy in neighborhoods with high crime.\n\n\"There is definitely a correlation between the two, but it's more of a selection issue. Poor people that are more prone to crime sort of get selected into rental properties because they don't have the income, they don't have the down payment for a home, they don't have the savings to actually become a property owner,\" Rephann said.\n\nBut that correlation wasn't the focus of his study. Rephann's research was on Cumberland, Maryland, where he said a pattern of non-local and high-volume landlords appeared during the housing bubble of the mid-2000s. Those types of landlords, he said, generated a disproportionate number of the problem properties.\n\nThe vast majority of Cumberland's rental properties, upwards of 75 percent, didn't have any history of police contact, Rephann said. Less than 10 percent of the total rental property stock had a record of multiple contacts with police.\n\nMandatory landlord training was a piece of the solution Cumberland decided to adopt, Rephann said. The program was grandfathered in so existing landlords didn't have to participate, but those seeking a rental permit were charged a small fee and sent to a class on code, crime, property management, screening and contract enforcement.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it wasn't as stringent as we would have liked. As you can imagine, the landlord associations were up in arms, so as a compromise we eased our physical inspection programs a little bit,\" Rephann said. \"The owners are guardians of the properties, and more importantly, they're guardians of the neighborhoods. If they're not performing that guardianship role, people are more likely to get lax and violate the social norms of the neighborhood.\"\n\nThough he hasn't seen the details and wanted to reserve final judgment, Delaware Apartment Association President Paul Chantler already is skeptical of the proposed mandate. He said landlords statewide are willing to do their part for crime prevention, but he won't write a blank check of support when there already are laws in place and training available.\n\n\"To make it mandatory, my first response to that is why? What is behind this? Anytime you're talking mandatory, you're talking money,\" Chantler said.\n\nSTORY: Conversion fuel downtown office vacancy rate\n\nSTORY: Economic, societal shifts have rentals on the rise in Delaware\n\nChantler rejects out of hand crime can be pinned onto landlords, and he said the perception of the two being related is outdated as Americans increasingly choose renting over owning for personal reasons as much as financial.\n\nAnd Frank Brevoort, president of the landlord association Greater Wilmington Housing Providers, said he's not sure how much a single class could teach a 30-year veteran of the rental industry like himself. He acknowledges crime is a problem — bad for both business and the community — but fighting it already is in a smart landlord's best interest.\n\n\"It's not an easy thing to deal with, but obviously if you have a house that's full of drug pushers, then that brings down the neighborhood and makes it difficult to rent the other houses and they go vacant. That block becomes a blight on the neighborhood, and that's a problem,\" Brevoort said. \"I don't know that we need any more regulation. I think there's probably enough already on the books. It's how do you get the appropriate people engaged?\"\n\nAlready in Delaware law are protections and obligations for both landlords and tenants.\n\nLandlords are required to conform to local law, provide safe and sanitary conditions and make repairs and arrangements necessary to keep the property in good condition in standing with the law unless otherwise noted in the lease. The law allows for but does not mandate screening of tenants through credit or criminal background checks. Tenants are protected against certain inquiries from prospective landlords relative to discrimination law.\n\nCabrera said a landlord can follow the letter of the law and still maintain a nuisance property, willfully or otherwise. Moreover, she pointed to first-time players in the rental game who don't know how to screen their tenants or the finer points of the business model.\n\n\"We have so many great landlords and people who have invested in the city to transform blocks and homes. I'm amazed at some of the architecture in our city. It's not those landlords. It's when we allow property owners, including businesses like liquor stores and corner stores, to conduct business in an unlawful way, the sense of lawlessness now has taken over a neighborhood,\" Cabrera said.\n\nKeeping landlords honest is a statewide effort.\n\nThe Wilmington Housing Authority offers a program which pays a portion of income-qualified tenants' rent with private landlords, but Acting Executive Director Karen Spellman said those property owners oftentimes believe WHA is responsible for maintenance and monitoring. But that isn't the case, and so she wants to mandate training in the future.\n\n\"It would put the landlord on notice they are responsible if that unit is called for nuisance, it is incumbent upon them to make sure they address that tenant and that they manage that tenant,\" Spellman said. \"A lot of times these absentee landlords collect their rent via mail, and they do no monitoring of the tenant or the property, especially if it's one that receives Section 8 because they are sure that every month they're at least going to get a check from the Housing Authority. For those on the private market, they're not really interested in the property. They're just interested in collecting the rent.\"\n\nDover offers free landlord training through the city and the state Department of Justice as part of the city's Safe Communities initiative.\n\nIn Newark, new city legislation meant to give inspectors the power access to homes to which they've been previously denied is chaffing landlords there. The city argues its inspectors are being denied access to check for health and safety concerns, and landlords are calling their legislative action overreach and even a breach of the 4th Amendment.\n\nAnd in Edgemoor Gardens north of Wilmington, a community where about 80 percent of its 380 units are rentals, Delaware Housing Coalition Executive Director Patricia Kelleher said stricter rules on who buys properties there could affect the crime rate.\n\n\"There's some really egregious things that go on there. The landlords evict by changing locks. People who rent there are terrified of complaining about things that aren't working, even really serious things like electrical problems or plumbing problems,\" Kelleher said. \"One of the things we've been trying to do with that community is reach out to landlords to train them about managing their properties better, taking better care of their tenants and how in the end a better business practice for them.\"\n\nLandlords should be held accountable to a point, O’Neill said, when there's crime going on in their properties, but through a police investigation which targets whether they were contributing or encouraging it. He said landlords shouldn't be expected to act like police officers.\n\n\"If you look at the true absentee landlords, who never shows up at his house and just collects a check, there's a huge chance there could be some things going on at his property that aren't kosher. A contentious landlord will check in, even if it's just to see you still have four walls standing. Doing periodic checks on your property, that's just common business sense,\" O’Neill said. \"It's hard for them to enforce it lumping in good landlords with the bad because the low-hanging fruit is the good landlords.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nWilmington rental training proposal", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2020/06/25/coronavirus-salisbury-maryland-rent-tenants-rights/3234605001/", "title": "Despite coronavirus pandemic, Maryland tenants risk losing their ...", "text": "SALISBURY, Md.— One man suffered with COVID-19 for nearly five weeks, only to be denied lease renewal on the other side of recovery.

All but one of the cases have occurred in adults.\n\n“Losing a loved one is devastating, and it’s troubling to see the toll that COVID-19 is taking on elderly residents here in Indiana and across the country,” said State Health Commissioner Kris Box.\n\nIllinois, New York join California in ordering lockdowns\n\nIllinois and New York state joined California on Friday in ordering all residents to stay in their homes unless they have vital reasons to go out, restricting the movement of more than 70 million people in the most sweeping efforts yet in the U.S. to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe governors of the three states acted in a bid to fend off the kind of onslaught that has caused the health system in southern Europe to buckle. The three states encompass the three biggest cities in America: New York, Los Angeles and Chicago.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that starting Sunday, all workers in nonessential businesses must stay home as much as possible, and all gatherings of any size will be banned in the state of over 19 million people. He acted after California all but confined its 40 million residents Friday in the biggest lockdown in the nation.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a similar order set to take effect on Saturday for the state's 12.6 million people.\n\nExceptions were made for vital jobs and errands, such as grocery shopping and obtaining medicine, as well as exercise.\n\n-- Tim Sullivan, Nicole Winfield, Associated Press\n\nIU Bloomington student tests positive for COVID-19\n\nThe Monroe County Health Department has received notification of a positive test of COVID-19 for an Indiana University Bloomington student living off campus, according to a news release.\n\nThe student has been in isolation since March 13 and is now exhibiting mild symptoms.\n\nThe health department is working to determine others who could have come in contact with the student. The department will follow up with the student to determine when they can be released from isolation.\n\nIU also announced Friday that commencement ceremonies for all campuses are postponed.\n\n\"All IU graduates will be able to participate in a future IU Commencement Ceremony when the public health situation again allows us to do so,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nDelaware County reports first case of COVID-19\n\nIU Health now testing for COVD-19\n\nIndiana University Health is now testing for COVID-19 in its own laboratory, hospital officials say.\n\nThe health system can now run about 500 tests a day and over the next couple of weeks will ramp up to as many as 2,500 tests a day, said Joe Meyer, senior vice president of system operations.\n\nDepending on demand for the test, results should come back in less than a day.\n\nPeople must have a doctor’s order to be tested. The tests will be performed only in hospitals or emergency rooms.\n\nPriority will be given to testing those who are hospitalized with severe illness, high risk people and health care workers who may have been exposed.\n\nIU Health’s entry into COVID-19 testing will help expand testing options. Earlier this week, Eli Lilly and Co. announced that it would start offering a test as well.\n\n“We will be testing more people who would have been less likely to be tested,” Meyer said. “The way we are treating patients and potential exposures will change over the next few days as testing becomes more available. … You will see the capacity to test expand really significantly.”\n\nAbout a week ago a health care worker with a high risk exposure would have been told to go into self-isolation for two weeks and monitor for symptoms. Now that person could be eligible testing; a negative test result could put him or her back at work sooner.\n\nHowever, healthy patients with mild symptoms will still be told to follow self-isolation practices and forego testing, IU Health officials said.\n\nThe hospital system will report results of all testing, both positive and negative, to the Indiana State Department of Health, Meyer said.\n\n— Shari Rudavsky\n\nNavient donates thousands of face masks to Community Hospital North\n\nPrivate loan servicer Navient has donated 2,700 face masks to Community Hospital North near a Navient site in Fishers.\n\nNavient maintains a supply of masks for “business resiliency purposes,” according to a statement.\n\n“But we have more than needed for the current environment,” the statement reads.\n\n“Across the entire company, nationwide, all excess masks are being donated to local hospitals, the American Red Cross, and other organizations because of the urgent need.”\n\nIMPD offers safety tips for delivery drivers\n\nAs people become more reliant on delivery from local restaurants, grocery delivery services and online shopping, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is advising all delivery drivers to exercise caution while fulfilling orders.\n\n“While the IMPD has not seen a discernable uptick in robberies since the enactment of social distancing guidelines, we ask that residents look out for the safety of our city’s service workers who continue to provide our community with needed resources and nutrition through the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nIMPD offers the following tips to reduce drivers’ chance of being robbed:\n\nDrivers should limit the amount of cash on hand\n\nCredit cards should be used for all delivery sales whenever possible\n\nFor business owners taking the order, advise the caller/customer that for the health and safety of the driver, to meet the driver outside of their building or dwelling\n\nAlways ask for a customer call back number and verify the number prior to delivery\n\nPrior to delivery, instruct the driver to utilize the call back number to confirm the delivery and be sure to meet outside, in a well-lit location.\n\nHow to report unlawful eviction, foreclosure during pandemic\n\nIndiana Attorney General Curtis Hill is asking consumers to file complaints with his office should eviction or foreclosure proceedings initiate or continue during the state's public health crisis.\n\nGov. Eric Holcomb issued an executive order Thursday that prohibits the initiation or continuation of eviction or foreclosure proceedings until Indiana’s public health emergency is terminated. The order does not relieve individuals from having to pay their mortgages or rent. Complaints can be filed online with the Office’s Consumer Protection Division.\n\nIf you have issues paying your mortgage or are already in foreclosure proceedings, the attorney general’s office may be able help.

Eric Holcomb says there is no \"shelter in place\" order coming at this time for Indiana, even as other cities and states, including California and New York City, take such actions. Holcomb said he hopes that won't happen here. \"We're not there yet,\" he said during a Friday press conference.\n\nIndiana primary moved\n\nGovernor Eric Holcomb joined Secretary of State Connie Lawson, Republican Party Chair Kyle Hupfer and Democratic Party Chair John Zody today to announce that the date of this year’s Indiana primary election will move from May 5 to June 2.\n\nAll dates corresponding with the primary election will be moved by 28 days to reflect the new date of the primary. For example, military and overseas ballots are required to mailed 45 days prior to the primary election, so they’ll move 45 days prior to June 2.\n\nThese recommendations have also been made to the Indiana Election Commission:\n\nSuspend absentee by-mail rules to allow all Hoosiers to vote by mail in the primary.\n\nAllow county clerks to continually mail ballots from now through 12 days out from the new primary date.\n\nConfirm ballots with a May 5, 2020 date will be valid.\n\nEnable medical professionals to be eligible members of traveling boards to to help nursing home and hospital patients vote.\n\nGive family members the ability to deliver absentee ballots.\n\nRead more here.\n\nCitizens Energy: Please do not flush things that are not toilet paper\n\nCitizens Energy Group is reminding Hoosiers to avoid flushing wipes, paper towels and anything that’s not supposed to go in the toilet.\n\nWith toilet paper suddenly a hot commodity, sanitation systems across the country have been warning residents to avoid flushing napkins, paper towels and any other creative hygiene alternatives down the toilet.\n\n“They are not flushable, and they are not biodegradable,” Stephen Renner, director of the Department of Sanitary Engineering in Franklin County, Ohio, told USA Today. “They wreak havoc in our system. ...

Donations will be accepted during limited hours of 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nSome facilities remain open to provide meals to students and their families.\n\nBMV waiving late fees during pandemic\n\nThe Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles is waiving some late fees and changing some requirements amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHoosiers should not go to a BMV branch to renew a vehicle’s registration or request replacement documents for a driver’s license, identification card, registration or title. Those transactions have been restricted to out-of-branch only. Instead of going to a branch, drivers can do those things at in.gov/BMV or BMV Connect kiosks at local stores. You can also do it by phone or mail.\n\nEffective yesterday and lasting for the next 60 days, drivers will not need to pay these fees:\n\nLate driver’s license or identification card renewals\n\nLate vehicle registration renewals\n\nLate title transactions\n\nLate off-road vehicle and snowmobile registration renewals\n\nLate salvage titles\n\nHoosiers may also see some closed branches: A rule requiring each Indiana county to have an operating BMV branch has been suspended “due to potential staffing shortages.”\n\nAir traffic controller tests positive\n\nParts of the radar center at Indianapolis International Airport have been cleaned and sanitized after an air traffic controller tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n“The work areas were vacated Thursday night, but the center remains open and operational,” the Federal Aviation Administration said Friday. “Flights through the airspace handled by those sectors were rerouted as part of a longstanding contingency plan to ensure continued operations.”\n\nAn industrial cleaning crew sanitized three areas in the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center after a supervisor tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, the FAA said.\n\nThe center’s controllers monitor high-altitude, cross-country flights. It remained open on Friday.\n\nThe center offices are separate from the tower and the airport terminal and do not interact with the travelling public, a spokeswoman for the Indianapolis International Airport said.\n\nThe FAA said it is working with health officials and employee representatives to figure out how many others the supervisor had been in contact with in recent days.\n\n23 new coronavirus cases\n\nThe number of new coronavirus cases in Indiana continues to climb, with an additional 23 cases reported in the past 24 hours, for a total of 79.\n\nMarion County now has 25 cases, with six new cases in the Friday update. Hamilton County reported three new cases for a total of five. Johnson has one new case for a total of four cases, the same number Hendricks County has. Boone County added one case, bringing it to two.\n\nBesides Marion County, Lake and St. Joseph Counties each now have six cases, an increase of two and three respectively, over Thursday’s update.\n\nThe state has tested 554 people but that number may not include testing done by private laboratories, which do not necessarily report negative results to the state. While positive results found through private testing must be reported to the state, such reporting may be delayed, state health officials said in a press release.\n\nCases have now been reported in 27 of Indiana’s 92 counties.\n\n— Shari Rudavsky\n\nDivision of Family Resources offices to close to the public\n\nThe Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will close its Division of Family Resources offices to the public at the end of business Friday, March 20, until further notice. The decision was made as FSSA and state health leaders consider the best options for promoting social distancing to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n“Our clients should know, first and foremost, that their benefits are safe. SNAP and TANF benefits will continue without interruption as long as the public health emergency exists,” said Dr. Jennifer Sullivan.\n\nWhile the agency's physical locations are closed, online and telephone services will continue to operate as normal. The FSSA online benefits portal is available around the clock for clients who need to submit applications or submit changes to their case.\n\nDFR staff are available by phone at 800-403-0864 to provide customer service Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. All scheduled appointments will take place via telephone. Clients may also continue to send documents to DFR via mail at P.O. Box 1810, Marion, IN 46952.\n\nSullivan strongly encourages Hoosiers in need of food or cash assistance or health coverage to submit applications for SNAP, TANF and health coverage online. Health coverage applications can also be completed over the phone at 800-403-0864. Paper applications will be available outside each DFR local office in English and Spanish and can be submitted via mail.\n\nLife continues to change\n\nLife for Hoosiers continues to change by the day as the state, country and world grapple with the coronavirus. Indiana has closed all schools until at least May 1. Madison County has restricted the number of mourners allowed to attend funerals. More than 22,000 Hoosiers applied for unemployment benefits in the last week.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, 56 people in Indiana had tested positive for COVID-19. That's a jump of 17 new cases over the previous day, and is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of people tested. Those figures are updated daily at 10 a.m.\n\nIndiana Gov. Eric Holcomb announced new steps Thursday to combat the spread of COVID-19 Thursday.\n\n\"We recognize how hard all of these efforts are on Hoosiers,\" Holcomb said at a press conference Thursday afternoon.\n\nOther changes include a planned extension of the state of emergency for another 30 days past Apr. 5, a delay of state income tax filing and payment deadlines, moratoriums on evictions, foreclosures and insurance policy cancellations.

Worldwide, the death toll has topped 10,000, with more than 244,500 confirmed cases.\n\nIn California, all residents are being requested to stay home. In Pennsylvania, the governor has ordered all \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses to shut down, or risk enforcement from state police.\n\nThe death toll in Italy has now surpassed that of China. More than 3,400 people have died in the European nation.\n\nYounger Americans can also face serious issues with coronavirus, including hospitalization and, in some cases, death, the CDC warned. The disease remains most dangerous for those over 60 or with underlying health conditions.\n\nReports on Thursday revealed Sens.

That term generally refers to the power of the press in its ability to advocate for people or a cause, and question those in power.\n\nIt’s a responsibility the reporters, photographers and editors at Delaware Online/The News Journal take seriously.\n\nOver my 35-year journalism career, I have watched the industry navigate sweeping changes. Not all have been good as we struggle with revenue challenges. But our ability to reach people through digital, social and print is at its highest point ever.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal has more people reading us each month than the total population of Delaware. Our digital-only subscriber audience – those who pay for our exclusive content online – is now double that of our print circulation.\n\nHow we reach people is changing. Our mission has not.\n\nSo what we do with this power to reach so many people remains critical. The staff at Delaware Online/The News Journal has made a commitment to focus on stories that matter. The staff goes beyond the press releases and public statements to hold those in power accountable.\n\nThat isn’t always easy. Delaware’s open records laws lean heavily in favor of the state, which makes it very difficult to get information to the public. Local, county and state officials often ask for fees in the hundreds and thousands of dollars to prepare information supported by tax dollars.\n\nBut the staff pushes through those challenges to keep you informed.\n\nOur work detailed decades of sexual harassment in the New Castle County Police Department, leading to a settlement of a federal lawsuit and brought an apology from county leaders.\n\nOur reporting uncovered that the state failed to release results that showed high levels of lead in school water sources for more than a year, and we’ve been pressuring officials to explain the breakdown in communicating with schools, parents and the community.\n\nWhen a Georgia sheriff defended his deputies who stopped, boarded and searched a bus of Delaware State University student-athletes, our reporters got to the truth. We obtained and reviewed body camera footage that contradicted what the sheriff told reporters.\n\nThese are just a few examples of what you will find in this report.\n\nThis is our first of what will be an annual report on the impact of Delaware Online/The News Journal and its journalism. It’s not a comprehensive list of all our best work. Instead, it represents a selection of our stories that reflect our core mission.\n\nWe do this to test ourselves, to be sure we are remaining true to our obligation to be our very best every day, to get after the stories that matter in the First State. And we do it to share with you our most important work.\n\nI thank you for your support in keeping local journalism strong in Delaware.\n\nMike FeeleyExecutive EditorDelaware Online/The News JournalMid-Atlantic Editor, USA Today Network\n\nMore than a year after Delaware Online published a blistering investigation into one of Delaware's largest police departments, the County Council approved a $1.7 million settlement.\n\nThe May 2020 probe detailed stories from six women with a combined 132 years of experience on the force who said the former New Castle County police deputy chief sexually harassed women for decades while high-ranking superiors and county officials looked the other way.\n\nIn addition to the settlement, County Executive Matt Meyer issued a formal apology, the former deputy chief will pay an undisclosed amount of money to the women and a monitor will review sexual assault and harassment personnel complaints for the next three years.\n\nTHE FALLOUT:NCCo settles suit over sex harassment, cover-up inside Police Department\n\nAt least a dozen prisoners in the past seven years filed lawsuits related to one Delaware Department of Correction officer.\n\nDelaware Online's review of these documents plus inmate interviews show the officer has repeatedly been accused of escalating situations by provoking prisoners.\n\nThe reporting is a particular challenge because the state Department of Correction can withhold information from personnel files, investigations, complaints and surveillance video.\n\nWe also found another story of alleged abuse in which correctional officers are accused of slamming a prisoner's head into a glass security window. They then charged him, saying he escaped and head-butted the window on his own.\n\nOur reporting was followed by dozens more prisoners filing suit with representation by the ACLU as well as a departmental review of violence by officers in the prison.\n\nTAKING ACTION:Prisoner lawsuit claims beatings, 'pattern of excessive force' at Sussex Correctional Institution\n\nIn late summer, the state Department of Education released an email letting the public know that the lead issue in several Delaware schools' water supplies was mostly remediated. It's the kind of email we all get many times a day.\n\nAny amount of lead in water, especially in communities of children, can pose serious health threats. We started reporting the story and quickly came to some shocking discoveries:\n\nA little more than a year before, lead testing had shown elevated levels of lead in school water supplies, many in faucets where water was consumed by students.\n\nThe schools were never made aware of the lead levels, and none of the water supplies were turned off while any remediation was done.\n\nStaff, parents and students were never informed of the lead levels and continued using the water.\n\nIf it wasn't for The News Journal's reporting on the lead testing performed in Delaware schools, the public may never have been alerted to the nearly 50 schools that had elevated levels of lead.\n\nThe newspaper's initial reporting on the testing along with continued coverage revealed how the state ignored the basic requirements and best practices for testing for lead in water.\n\nThe missteps and lack of communication to the public on the results prompted residents to petition legislators to hold a joint legislative hearing on the issue. The virtual hearing drew more than 500 angry parents.\n\nOur stories got the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency (the federal department that doled out the grant money for the testing), which is now looking into how poorly Delaware officials handled the testing and adhered to the provisions of the grant.\n\nREAD THE STORY:How Delaware's handling of lead water testing put thousands of students and staff at risk\n\nIn the fall of 2021, the Delaware Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction from 16 years before of a then-16-year-old named Mark Purnell because prosecutors withheld evidence that could have exonerated him at trial.\n\nHe was not released from prison then because prosecutors said they wanted to retry the case. Months went by with little movement in the case. Purnell was denied temporary release to visit his dying mother, then denied release to attend her funeral.\n\nWe wrote about prosecutors telling the court that Purnell should not be released on bail because he would pose an extreme danger to the community. But quietly, behind the scenes, and in order to avoid a civil suit, they had offered Purnell a deal that if he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, they would free him immediately.\n\nThe story also included new revelations showing that ever since the Supreme Court ruling, prosecutors and investigators were still withholding evidence, specifically a police interrogation where another person confessed to the crime.\n\nThe day after that story published, prosecutors dropped all charges and released Purnell in the middle of the night.\n\nREAD THE STORY:Delaware man's decade-old murder conviction overturned; release from prison may follow\n\nIn May, seven apartments in Wilmington were condemned because the landlord had for several years failed to make repairs and improvements, even after city inspectors had issued warnings.\n\nThe condemnation forced seven families out of their homes and into emergency homeless shelters and motel rooms. As of September, many were still there because there was no available affordable housing.\n\nYet, just a couple weeks after the condemnation, before any repairs had even started, the landlord had the condemned apartment advertised as \"available\" and \"for rent.\" Our story revealed what the landlord was attempting to do, seek new tenants for unlivable apartments where people who had paid rent had been displaced.\n\nThat provoked the city's chief of staff and the Licensing and Inspections Department to meet with the landlord and make sure the ads were taken down and that no tenants could step foot in the homes until all repairs were performed and approved.\n\nTHE REPORTING:Amid state probe, Wilmington landlord advertises apartment for rent in condemned building\n\nAfter Georgia sheriff's deputies stopped a Delaware State University women's lacrosse team bus in south Georgia, the county sheriff insisted, multiple times, that none of the HBCU players' personal items were searched.\n\nThe sheriff defended the stop, pushing back on allegations by students and community leaders that it was racially motivated. But after reviewing the deputies' body camera footage that shows the men rifling through players' items, Delaware Online/The News Journal broke the story that the sheriff's statements were not accurate.\n\nThe story prompted an outcry from DSU leaders, state officials and NAACP leaders in both Delaware and Georgia, and Delaware's attorney general referred the incident to the U.S. Justice Department for a federal civil rights review.\n\nIMPACT:Delaware attorney general asks for federal civil rights review of DSU bus incident\n\nA bill that would give Wilmington officials the ability to take vacant property for \"community development\" if it remains unoccupied for three years or longer was quietly passed out of a Delaware House committee in late June, stirring concerns of government overreach, a lack of transparency and gentrification.\n\nThe measure was sent for a House vote, with just nine days left in the legislative session, giving lawmakers little time to read and research the measure (especially while the budget and loads of other bills were in front of them).\n\nIn addition, there was no discussion or public input sought by the committee. A day after we published our story revealing the lack of transparency, public outrage was swift and the bill was pulled from the docket and shelved.\n\nREAD THE IMPACT:Wilmington vacant property seizure bill off the table following a heated community meeting\n\nFor years, the foul smell of raw sewage had come and gone inside the Loflands’ Wilmington home in the 800 block of N. Monroe St. Despite complaints to the city's Department of Licenses and Inspections Code Enforcement and other local officials, the family never saw follow-up, resorting to wearing masks in their home to reduce the stench.\n\nBut when a Delaware Online/The News Journal reporter began asking questions about the issue of the odor and who was responsible, the city publicly apologized in a statement from the Wilmington mayor's office, admitting to a yearlong delay in addressing this issue.\n\nThe city also sent code enforcement out again to gain access to the vacant property responsible for the leak and determine how to proceed. This reporting exposed the challenges of enforcing violations and brought to light how difficult it can be as a resident to have your problems heard and addressed.\n\nREAD:Why a family's pleas about a bad sewer leak in their house was ignored for a year", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/09/affordable-housing-slim-ocean-city-rehoboth/973106001/", "title": "Resort areas leave vital employees out of house and home", "text": "After decades of working in the manufacturing industry, Casey VanCleve didn't retire: she became homeless.\n\nDisabling conditions ended her career as a forklift driver in Sacramento, California. With no family or support system, VanCleve nose-dived from steady income to shelter after shelter.\n\n“I worked my tail off all my life for 30 years,” said VanCleve, who moved to Ocean City, Maryland, in 2014. “I loved it.”\n\nFibromyalgia, degenerative arthritis and mental health conditions severed VanCleve’s paycheck, her security, her roof.\n\n“I am the new face of homelessness,” she said. “It’s not the idea that America has of homelessness — you think of someone who hasn’t bathed, or they don’t want to be housed. There’s a lot of people in this country that are homeless because they missed a paycheck.”\n\nVanCleve’s story of homelessness mimics nationwide trends as the miles between low-cost housing, employment and solid infrastructure hubs widen.\n\n\"I've been on the tri-county housing list for two and a half years,\" VanCleve said. \"Affordable housing isn't a huge deal in Ocean City. It's hard to come by, even in Salisbury.\"\n\nSteep housing rates impact folks working in resort areas such as Ocean City and east Sussex County, Delaware, where seasonal work and low-paying jobs clash with high land and construction costs and paltry financial incentives to build low-cost rentals.\n\nResort areas are a microcosm for the growing affordability gap in the United States: There is a housing shortage for extremely low-income renters in every state, according to National Low Income Housing Coalition.\n\n“We have an affordable housing crisis all across this country,” said Sean Kelly, vice president of Leon N. Weiner & Associates Inc., a Wilmington-based developer of multifamily affordable rental housing. “Incomes are not keeping up with the escalation in rent.”\n\nIn Sussex County, vacation rentals, single-family homes and affordable housing are all in demand, but without financial incentives, the latter tends to get little notice.\n\n“Maybe there’s a nonprofit out there with tons of money that can do it, but guys like me can’t do it,” said Preston Schell, president of Ocean Atlantic Cos.\n\nAffordable housing and homelessness are \"inextricably intertwined,\" said Tina Showalter, executive director of Housing Alliance Delaware.\n\n\"The affordable housing rule of thumb is no one should have to spend 30 percent of their income for shelter, and that rule has exploded in our state,\" she said.\n\nDomestic violence, a broken-down vehicle, layoffs at work, generational cycles of poverty, disabling conditions: these factors can easily write anyone's homeless-bound narrative.\n\n“What we know about homelessness is that once you enter, the climb out is daunting,” said Claudia Nagle, the executive director of Diakonia, a nonprofit organization in West Ocean City that provides emergency and transitional housing.\n\nVanCleve went to Las Vegas to stay with her brother, but he took off, leaving her alone. She hopped on a Greyhound bus and trekked to Virginia, where her sister lived.\n\n“That didn’t work out, so I moved to Salisbury,” she said, adding it was the only nearby city she found online that offered housing while she waited for her Social Security benefits.\n\nVanCleve's stay at the Salisbury shelter came to an end, so she left her temporary roof for another.\n\nIn 2016, nearly half of Americans experiencing sheltered homelessness had a disability, according to Housing and Urban Development.\n\n“Most of our people work,” Nagle said of Diakonia residents. “If they’re not working, it’s because they have some health issue or disabling condition that prohibits them from working.”\n\nDiakonia averages 300 calls every month for housing requests it is not able to meet.\n\nVanCleve arrived at Diakonia in 2014, carrying all her belongings in a bin and suitcase.\n\n“Nobody in this country knows how bad homelessness is,” VanCleve said. “I can guarantee that. And to be on the Shore and be homeless: Nobody here thinks that anyone is homeless.”\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, the Homeless Alliance for the Lower Shore of Maryland found homelessness had increased by 17 percent in Worcester, Somerset and Wicomico counties.\n\nIn Ocean City, homelessness fluctuates between the summer and offseason.\n\n“In the past, (people) had enough income and there was enough housing that they might not have been …” Ocean City resident Greta Rolland paused, a short silence filling the air. “It was a struggle for them but they weren’t homeless.”\n\nRolland, an information system administrator at the Homeless Alliance for the Lower Shore of Maryland, said she comes across more homeless people in the summer, since rentals are cheaper in the winter.\n\nBackground: New 'Housing First' approach to fighting homelessness working in Salisbury, mayor says\n\nThe seasonal discrepancy may affect the accuracy of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's annual Point in Time count, which requires programs like the Tri-County alliance to count homeless people on one night in January.\n\nIn 2017, the count for the Lower Eastern Shore was 260, but a more thorough count for a different assessment report by the alliance found 1,162 homeless people in the same year.\n\nBy anecdotal accounts, Rolland said people who work in the service industry — where part-time and seasonal jobs run aplenty — are hit hardest by the town's expensive rentals.\n\nNagle couldn’t think of any low-income housing in West Ocean City.\n\n“When housing is the primary factor in stability and you’re living in a community where the average rental is only six months, people find themselves trapped in a destabilizing cycle,” Nagle said. “With fluctuating housing prices and job instability caused by the tourism cycle, you’re looking at families and individuals potentially being displaced every six months.”\n\nThe crisis goes beyond seesawing rental prices.\n\nTom Ayd is trying to build low-cost housing in Ocean City. His affordable rental apartment development company, Green Street Housing, is encouraged by the state to build housing in more affluent areas, rather than ones with concentrated poverty.\n\n“I wanted to personally be the one who builds the next nice new affordable housing development,” said Ayd, a Stephen Decatur High School graduate.\n\nThey just cost a lot less than the market rate ones, he said.\n\nMore:Green Street plans for 80 affordable apartment units in Salisbury\n\nBut Ayd said he has a hard time building in places like Ocean City and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, because they’re already well-developed.\n\n“There’s not much residential-zoned property that hasn’t been built on,” he said.\n\nNew homes in Sussex County price out families and seniors earning lower incomes.\n\nThe average Sussex renter's wage is $12.92, according Housing Alliance Delaware. That's a $5 wage gap in affording a two-bedroom rental at fair market rate.\n\nAn employee making minimum wage ($8.25 per hour) would need to work at least 85 hours per week to afford such a rental.\n\n\"The median income of a health care aide or a preschool teacher is not sufficient to afford quickly rising market rents,\" said Kelly, the vice president of an affordable housing developer.\n\nThe median price for a home in Sussex County is about $295,000, making it difficult for a good portion of the workforce — those in retail, construction, health care and many other industries — to live near their employment.\n\n\"Wherever there are employment centers, there will be a demand for housing that can support the workforce,\" said Amy Walls, who chairs the advocacy sub-committee of the Sussex Housing Group.\n\nSchell, the president of Ocean Atlantic Cos., told Sussex County Council members that it would be easier to build moderately priced housing over affordable housing, which he said was not financially feasible without incentives that reduce the developers' cost.\n\nDropping the rent to 50 percent of the market rate — which is about $1,200 — without strong incentives would cause developers to lose money, he said.\n\n\"Because we're a second home and retirement mecca, our land costs reflect that,\" Schell said in a separate interview. \"Our market rate rents relative to construction costs do not support subsidizing a portion of the units as being affordable.\"\n\nThe difference between \"moderately priced\" and \"affordable\" housing is a few hundred dollars every month, enough to push low-income earners away from apartments from which Schell Brothers and other developers could profit.\n\nCouncilman Robert Arlett said developers “are going to go where they’re going to make a dollar,” since both low-income housing and pricier vacation rentals are in demand.\n\nEven with more incentives and allocated land, developers must contend with concerned residents.\n\n“If I make an argument for something near shopping, near transportation, and has county infrastructure, I’ll naturally have neighbors,” Schell said at the meeting. “And those neighbors will naturally show up behind me and tell you guys how horrible of a plan this is. They’ll usually say something along the lines of, ‘We’re in support of affordable housing. We understand it’s a need in our community. We just think this is a bad location.’ And then when you ask anyone, ‘Well, what’s a good location?’ there’s silence.”\n\nCurrently, low-income folks may have to wait up to two years for an affordable rental in Sussex County. As of late 2017, Delaware State Housing Authority had an open list of more than 11,000 people waiting for public housing and private housing vouchers in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nCounty mandates and incentives for developers to build affordable housing into fair market infrastructure would create socio-economic variety, instead of dropping substandard housing into impoverished areas.\n\n“In Sussex County, from a market perspective, we would like nothing more than to build more housing there,” Kelly said. “The demand is absolutely there. It is absolutely there.”\n\nThe housing crisis can hit working families particularly hard in resort areas.\n\n\"As soon as we label what homelessness looks like, it changes,\" said Susan Kent, director of Love Inc., a national church-supported nonprofit with a location in Seaford, Delaware, that assists homeless people. \"This year, we're experiencing a large increase in families.\"\n\nLast year, 144 people received emergency housing at Diakonia in Ocean City. Of those, 43 percent were families with school-aged children.\n\nRebekah James became one of the 144 when she arrived at Diakonia with her four children in September, three days after being evicted from her home.\n\nThe Virginia native strolled into one of the family units, taking her time to sit on a couch adjacent to a small kitchen. She left her walker by the dining table.\n\n\"I learned to just open my mouth and say, 'I’m homeless, and I really need y’all to work with me,' \" James said.\n\nShe worked at Mountaire Farms for six years, commuting four hours each day from Virginia to the Selbyville plant. She worked her way up to a supervisory role and, wanting to provide her kids with better opportunities, moved to Berlin.\n\nJames continued to do what she loved for the next two years, this time with a shortened commute. Her kids attended Stephen Decatur High School.\n\n\"They excelled just by moving,\" James said, with A-plus grades, two kids studying nursing and computer information technologies, and a son who recently struck a basketball scholarship with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore for proof.\n\nBut two years into the move, a serious fall took James out of work. Suddenly, she had no income.\n\n\"I never thought I would ever be homeless,\" James said. \"I never thought it would be a paycheck for me being out on the street.\"\n\nMore:Ocean City visitors tried to drive on the beach. It didn't end well\n\nMore:Showdown over pushing Ocean City offshore wind turbines out to sea draws a crowd\n\nAffordability issues hit resort areas beyond Rehoboth Beach and Ocean City.\n\nLike Ocean City, Asbury Park, New Jersey has a boardwalk with shopping, expansive beach and good eats. But the median income is just $32,000 per household, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThat is considerably less than the Monmouth County median household income of $94,000, according to the most recent New Jersey statistics provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nBut a new affordable housing project could help. The $20 million project, called The Renaissance, is scheduled to open in April 2019. It will feature three low-rise buildings and 64 residential housing units.\n\nThe apartments will rent from anywhere between $300 a month and $1,400 per month, according to Ginger Dawson, vice president of The Michaels Development Co., which is spearheading the project.\n\nTo qualify for housing, eligible applicants can earn no more than 60 percent of the median income in the Monmouth County area. For a family of four, that means earning about $54,000 or less.\n\nThe city is studying a number of measures, including an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which would mandate new developments set aside a certain amount of housing units for low- and moderate-income families.\n\nTo make up for the cost, developers could raise market rate prices somewhat, according to Brett Theodos, principal research associate in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\n\"For the privilege of building in a community, the city says part of that entails you have to produce affordable units as well,\" Theodos said, adding that these measures are targeted to people earning 60 to 80 percent of the median income, not extremely low-wage workers.\n\nIn localities where there is some market strength, evidence shows developers will keep developing, regardless of the mandate, according to Theodos.\n\nIn Collier County, Florida, a tourist-income-based economy coupled with a service-oriented workforce has led to scant affordable housing — something the county is slated to address this year.\n\nBut the nation's housing crisis extends beyond restaurant servers, landscapers and other lower-income employees.\n\n\"We're talking about folks in regular professions — ambulance drivers, school teachers and policeman who have been priced out of the market here,\" Collier County housing and grants manager Cormac Giblin said. \"It becomes a quality of life issue, not only for them but for the very affluent people they’re here to provide services for.\"\n\nThe local economy has been hit by Collier County's decades-long inability to support its workforce with affordable housing. Big companies facing employee shortages have relocated to other counties where they can find a sustainable workforce, Giblin said.\n\nEmployers like JW Marriott are looking for viable solutions on Marco Island, one of Collier County's popular tourist destinations.\n\nMarco Island is four by six miles long, so there is little space for further development, much less affordable housing.\n\nAs JW Marriott undergoes an expansion that will grow the resort by about 200 employees, being able to get staff to work is a top priority.\n\n\"We recognize that to continue to tap into associates who want to work at JW Marriott, we're going to have to come up with a transportation solution,\" said Amanda Cox, director of sales and marketing.\n\nMarco Island has a transportation system that busses workers in from up to 40 miles away, which Cox called a key component of the company's success there.\n\nCollier County's housing and grants department this year is working to increase the supply of affordable housing by finding dedicated funding sources, creating public-private partnerships and implementing other recommendations from its community housing plan.\n\nAbout 500 miles south of Ocean City, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, carries unemployment and few cheap housing options for hospitality employees in the offseason.\n\n“A lot of the hospitality jobs are part-time and low-pay,” said Kathy Jenkins, the executive director of New Directions, a homeless shelter in Myrtle Beach. “People come here thinking this is a great place to start over, not realizing how seasonal it is.”\n\nIts largely seasonal economy carries problems that are glaringly similar to Sussex and Worcester counties' transportation dilemmas.\n\n“The affordable housing is farther out in the county, but there’s no transportation to take them from the rural areas into the city,” Jenkins said, “so it’s sort of a Catch-22.”\n\nLower-income workers living on the more affordable southern end of Worcester County — in Pocomoke City and Snow Hill areas — must take hours-long bus rides to the more job-fertile northern part of the county, said Rolland, administrator for the Tri-County alliance.\n\nInsufficient year-round public transportation also makes it difficult for western Sussex County residents to work in the eastern part of the county, where incomes and rent are higher.\n\nWalls, who chairs the advocacy sub-committee of the Sussex Housing Group, said the organization works with a restaurant employee who uses public transportation to get to Rehoboth Beach from Milton, where he lives.\n\nDepending on transportation schedules, it can take him hours to get to his employment, and he sometimes gets off when the transportation system shuts down for the night, forcing him to spend his last two hours of wages earned on an Uber ride home.\n\nRunning more regular routes and placing housing near bus stations could help workers, according to the Sussex Housing Group.\n\n“In coastal Sussex County, it’s terribly expensive and that’s just the nature of the animal,” Councilman George Cole said during the planning December meeting.\n\nCole said high-density housing would cause more traffic issues, but Schell disagreed.\n\n\"If you want to address traffic, encourage people to live close to where they work,\" he said, arguing that other kinds of development are still allowed by the county. \"If (the county) is going to keep allowing guys like me to sell to retirees, (more people) will keep going to restaurants and hospitals, which means we're going to need people to work there and we need to supply that kind of housing, too.\"\n\nIt’s been about three months since Casey VanCleve, who lost her job due to disabling conditions, left Diakonia in Ocean City. She still comes back to volunteer.\n\nMore than two-thirds of discharged households that left the shelter headed for permanent housing in 2017.\n\nVanCleve stood inside the transitional housing at Diakonia that she once called home, and laughed.\n\nMorning light came through the lacy shades of her old room in the women's house.\n\n\"You have a dresser,\" she said, excitedly, about Diakonia's accommodations. \"Being homeless, the only thing I really wanted and truly missed was having a dresser.\"\n\nThe building was quiet. Everyone left by early morning, as required, to work on their housing situation, job prospects, mental health or substance abuse issues, and contribute to the Diakonia community.\n\nVanCleve attributes much of her current situation to Diakonia. Through the West Ocean City organization, she gained her support system.\n\n\"It's a series of bad things that happen to you and once you’re homeless …\" Greta Rolland said, trailing off once more. \"Really and truly homeless people are the bravest people I know. I could not imagine not having a place to live.\"\n\nSitting on the couch, Rebekah James recalled Diakonia being the first place she called after her eviction.\n\nHer daughter, Keyvina, was studying at Wor-Wic Community College to become a pediatric nurse practitioner. At 20 years old, Keyvina temporarily quit college to help her mother, picking up long hours at McDonald's as a manager.\n\nJames had much-needed surgery during her stay at Diakonia. Sitting calmly, she exuded a palpable energy, doting on how her daughter is slated to return to school in the fall.\n\nEchoing her daughter, James wants to go to school to become a registered nurse once she receives physical therapy.\n\nThat week in February, while coming home from church, James and her kids stopped by a rental in Snow Hill. She felt \"confident\" they could get it, so she messaged the landlord. They met up and had a conversation.\n\nShe told him everything, from her injury and her family being evicted to becoming homeless and living in a shelter.\n\n\"When he shook my hand, I knew the house was mine,\" James said.\n\nThat weekend, he told her he would rent the house to her and asked when did she want to move in.\n\n\"I've been waiting, looking, looking and now ... \" James stopped, letting the news sink in once again.\n\nThe mother of four stood up, slow and steady, and grasped her walker. Strolling out onto a wide, shadowed porch, she breathed in the chilly, vibrant air of another day.\n\n\"I have such determination, I can't stop,\" James said. \"I just can't.\"\n\nAsbury Park Press's Austin Bogues contributed to this report.\n\nMore:New Rehoboth tavern plans to serve classic fare with modern cuisine\n\nMore:Fager's Island event to benefit Berlin fire victims", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2022/07/12/two-weeks-before-condemnation-wilmington-inspectors-say-leaks-fixed/65370848007/", "title": "Two weeks before condemnation, Wilmington inspectors say leaks ...", "text": "Two weeks before apartments on North Adams Street were condemned following an exterior wall collapse and the discovery of a slew of safety hazards, Wilmington building inspectors signed off on the safety of one of those units, claiming ceiling leaks, mold and mildew, and weak floors were fixed.\n\nCity inspectors reported repairs to apartment six at 810 N.

In partnership with Auburn University Montgomery, 600 doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be provided to MPS employees Friday. “We are very thankful to AUM for helping us offer our employees another opportunity to be vaccinated,” Superintendent Ann Roy Moore said in a news release. “We take health and safety seriously, and it is important to us to provide our teachers and support staff access to the COVID vaccine.” The clinic, at the campus’ Wellness Center, will also provide vaccines to the general public. Patients must make an appointment ahead of time at aum.edu/vaccine. As of Monday, the state’s vaccine eligibility was opened to everyone 16 and older. “Throughout the pandemic, the employees of Montgomery Public Schools have demonstrated incredible dedication and resourcefulness in serving the educational needs of nearly 30,000 students,” Auburn University at Montgomery Chancellor Carl A. Stockton said in the release. “As a community-minded, partnership-oriented university, we are delighted to assist our local educators.”\n\nAlaska\n\nBethel: Alaska tribes will receive more than $1 billion from the most recent $1.9 trillion federal coronavirus relief bill. The tribes can take as long as three years to spend these funds, unlike a similar bill that was passed in 2020, which had a shorter deadline, KYUK-AM reports. Teresa Jacobsson from the Alaska Tribal Administrators Association said tribes will have more leeway on how to spend the funds compared to previous legislation. But the government will not just give tribal members checks without a reason. “You have to show a need, which is show basic living essentials like housing and rent expenses, utilities, internet connectivity, personal cleaning and sanitation products,” Jacobsson said. “You have to tie the money to a COVID-related need.” Alaska tribes will be required to document their spending because records will be reviewed by auditors. They can spend part of the federal funds to get professional help to manage the spending, but Jacobsson said beneficiaries will have to be cognizant of consultants and contractors who have taken advantage of tribes who have received virus relief funds in the past.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Monday signed legislation giving businesses, nursing homes and others a broad shield from lawsuits related to COVID-19, making Arizona the latest state to limit liability after the pandemic. Republican lawmakers approved the legislation in party-line votes in the House and Senate last week, saying businesses struggled during the pandemic and shouldn’t have to worry about the potential for frivolous lawsuits. The measure was fiercely opposed by consumer advocates and lawyers, who say it will reward bad actors who flouted health guidance and endangered their workers or the public. They say there’s been no deluge of COVID-19 lawsuits. Business and medical interest groups have pushed hard for a liability shield since the start of the pandemic. Ducey called for the measure in his State of the State address in January. The bill raises the bar for winning pandemic-related lawsuits against businesses, health care providers, nursing homes, nonprofits, governments, churches and schools. Instead of proving negligence by a preponderance of the evidence, plaintiffs would have to prove “gross negligence” or “willful misconduct” by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Active coronavirus cases continued to decrease Monday as the state reported five new deaths from the virus. The Department of Health reported that active cases, ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, decreased by 125 to 1,607. The state’s COVID-19 deaths now total 5,648 since the pandemic began last year. COVID-19 hospitalizations remained unchanged at 145. Overall, the state’s coronavirus cases increased by 44 to 331,098 total since the pandemic began. The department said nearly 8,800 additional COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in the state. More than 1.2 million of the 1.8 million doses allocated to the state have been given so far. Arkansas last week expanded its vaccine eligibility to everyone 16 and older.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Despite promises from Gov. Gavin Newsom to build an “army” of contact tracers to contain the coronavirus, a new audit says the state mustered less than half of the number promised. But even if the staffing goals were met, it would not have been enough. The intended number of contact tracers was based on an assumption that California would average 5,000 new coronavirus infections a day. But the nation’s most populated state averaged 25,000 per day from late November to the end of December. “The sheer number of cases has overwhelmed local health jurisdictions’ contact tracing efforts,” State Auditor Elaine Howle wrote in the report released Thursday. Public health officials say one of the best ways to slow the spread of a dangerous disease is to contact infected people and retrace their steps. The goal is to identify others who have been exposed, contact them and ask them to quarantine before they can spread the virus to others. Contact tracing was central to California’s strategy early in the pandemic. The Department of Public Health estimated the state needed 31,400 contact tracers. Newsom pledged to train 10,000 state workers and deploy them to help local public health departments meet that goal. But by January, California had just 12,100 contact tracers, including 2,262 state workers.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: State health department officials said they would explore the possibility of COVID-19 vaccine passports. As of Monday, there is no statewide program for vaccine passports, the Denver Post reports. “While we are exploring what’s working in other states, anything we do will be specific to Colorado and our needs,” a spokesperson for the state Department of Public Health and Environment said in an email. “A business could not access a customer’s protected health information, such as their COVID-19 immunization status, unless that person volunteered that information.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last Friday that any potential vaccine passports would be primarily directed by private businesses. Vaccine passports have become a political flashpoint in the U.S. even as they have come into use in Israel and are under development in Europe. Some Republicans in the U.S. see them as heavy-handed government intrusion. Live events in Colorado have already begun to open up. Red Rocks Amphitheatre was closed for most of the past year but will reopen later this month with a 2,500-person capacity. A spokesperson for the venue said it does not plan on having concertgoers show proof of vaccination yet.\n\nConnecticut\n\nManchester: Several school districts have been forced to close or stop in-person learning for a day, after educators attending vaccine clinics called in sick with side effects from the shots. Manchester schools reported a shortage of teachers and bus drivers Monday after a vaccine clinic for educators over the weekend. “I understand the challenges this causes for parents and families and had hoped to avoid going remote for the day,” Matt Geary, the town’s school superintendent, wrote to the community Monday. “I apologize for the inconvenience.” A similar incident caused a Colchester elementary school to close for a day last month and forced Stamford schools to delay a return to in-person learning for one day. In Region 13, which includes Durham and Middlefield, officials proactively scheduled a day off for Monday after a clinic was scheduled April 3 to give educators their second vaccine dose. “The good news is that we held one snow day in reserve for this exact scenario, so we do not need to adjust our calendar or change the graduation date,” Superintendent Doug Schuch wrote. Southington officials made a similar decision last month, giving staff a day off the Monday after a March 14 clinic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In March 2020, more than a thousand cars flooded to the Chase Center as people tried to get a box of free food for their families. Many of them had lost their jobs as businesses were forced to shutter. The cars backed up onto I-95 for the Food Bank of Delaware’s first emergency food drive during the pandemic. One year later, the Food Bank of Delaware has distributed nearly 18million pounds of food to families across the state – a record number. It supplied nearly 6 million more pounds to families compared with the same time period a year prior. “I have been here at the food bank since 2008. I was here right when the Great Recession hit, and what we have experienced over the past year cannot even compare to that,” said Kim Turner, a spokesperson for the Food Bank. Before the pandemic, Turner said there were about 121,000 food-insecure Delawareans. Now, she expects there are more than 164,000. The Food Bank was flooded with donations soon after the pandemic began, but they have leveled off since then. Turner said the community “stepped up” with food and monetary donations to help them serve as many families as they have. “We were overwhelmed with the generosity from the community. People were so generous, whether they sent $5 or $5,000,” she said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: All D.C. residents 16 and older will become eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine April 19, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the eligibility expansion in a tweet Monday, a day before a White House official said President Joe Biden expects all U.S. adults to be eligible by that date. All essential workers in D.C.’s Phase 1C Tier 3 will still become eligible next Monday, according to the tweet from Bowser. Hours earlier, the mayor announced that capacity limits for entertainment venues, special events, pools, recreational activities, retail stores, libraries and museums across the district will be increased in May.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gov. Ron DeSantis pushed back aggressively Tuesday against a “60 Minutes” report that suggested he initially made a deal to distribute COVID-19 vaccines at Publix Super Markets pharmacies because the company made a donation to his political action committee. The Republican governor warned of unspecified “consequences” over the report that aired Sunday night on CBS, which stood behind the story. The report focused on the vaccine rollout in Palm Beach County and also suggested Florida’s vaccine distribution had generally favored the wealthy and well-connected. “These are smear merchants,” DeSantis said during a news conference in Panama City. “They knew what they were doing was a lie.” The governor said his office had offered people to be interviewed about Florida’s vaccine rollout for the report, but the news show declined. He called the “pay-to-play” allegations in the report “lies built on lies.” CBS said in a statement that “60 Minutes” interviewed dozens of people about the story and requested interviews with DeSantis, who declined, and Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz, who declined to be interviewed on camera until after the story’s deadline.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state has hit a milestone of administering more than 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday. The state reached the 3 million mark March 19, Kemp said. That means that more than 1 million doses of vaccine were administered in about 15 days. Kemp recently rolled back coronavirus restrictions. He signed an executive order that ends a ban on large gatherings, eliminates shelter-in-place requirements, and reduces any remaining distance requirements at restaurants, bars, and movie theaters and between people at group fitness classes. The rollback starts Thursday and runs through April 30. On Monday, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr and the Georgia Department of Health warned that scammers have been trying to exploit the vaccine rollout, texting or emailing people asking for payments for the vaccine, scheduling an appointment or getting on the waiting list. “Scam artists are attempting to take advantage of people’s sense of urgency about getting the vaccine,” Carr said in a statement. “Remember that the vaccine is free, and hang up on any caller who asks you for money or personal information related to the vaccine.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s vacation rental market has outperformed hotels in occupancy rates in every month since October. Vacation rental owners across the state have said the higher demand was prompted by pandemic-related attitude shifts that prioritize space and seclusion for getaways, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Other rental home operators have said that the pandemic-induced reduction in some hotel services, such as daily housekeeping, has decreased the service gap between homes and vacation rentals, according to the newspaper. Matt Beall, the CEO of the full-service real estate brokerage Hawaii Life, said the company is enjoying its best year on record for vacation rentals. The dramatic demand increase happened as some counties attempted to regulate the industry. Longtime hotelier Jerry Gibson said regulating vacation rentals is important for state residents and to aid job recovery for hotel workers. “Vacation rental occupancy was 7 percentage points higher than hotel occupancy in 2020,” Gibson said. “The current situation is impacting job recovery for hotels. It’s also affecting resident sentiment. The general public would rather have people in the tourism zones than in their neighborhood.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will receive nearly $21 million in federal funds to encourage people to get COVID-19 vaccines and to improve access among racial and ethnic minorities. The $20.7 million comes as part of the latest pandemic aid package signed into law by President Joe Biden. Alex Adams, with the Idaho Division of Financial Management, told the Idaho Statesman that the state is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to finalize possible ways to use the funding while meeting equity requirements. State legislators must approve the appropriations before the money can be spent. Most of the funding must go to programs designed to increase vaccine access and uptake among racial and ethnic minority groups. Much of the money is expected to go to local health departments, community organizations and health centers. Idaho didn’t start collecting race and ethnicity data on people provided COVID-19 shots until the vaccination program was well underway because state leaders incorrectly said they were not legally allowed to track those demographics. As a result, the state is missing race data from about a quarter of the people who have been vaccinated and ethnicity data from more than one-third of the total number.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An indoor event at a bar in rural Illinois triggered 46 cases of COVID-19, the hospitalization of a resident of a long-term care facility and a school shutdown, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Monday. Attendees of the bar opening event in February reported “inconsistent” mask-wearing and lax physical distancing. In the end, those who tested positive for the coronavirus included three bar staff members, 26 patrons and 17 others who were infected by those who went to the bar. A 650-student school had to shut down because so many people were in quarantine, according to the CDC. The findings show that “transmission originating in a business such as a bar not only affects the patrons and employees of the bar but can also affect an entire community,” the report said. For example, one bar patron who reported a runny nose two days after the event had close contact with 26 people during in-person classes and indoor sports practice at school. Within days, two student athletes tested positive for the virus. The school closed for two weeks starting Feb. 18 because 13 school employees were in isolation or quarantine or had a child who was quarantined. The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed Monday that the outbreak occurred in Douglas County.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state is getting $60.8million in federal funding to support efforts to get minority populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic vaccinated against COVID-19. The funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will help programs such as door-to-door outreach to raise awareness about vaccinations or help people sign up to get vaccinated. The money comes from pandemic relief funding approved by Congress. Indiana’s funding is part of $3 billion the CDC is distributing among 64 jurisdictions to encourage vaccination and access to vaccines for communities that COVID-19 has disproportionately affected. While Black people make up about 9.4% of Indiana’s population over the age of 16, Black residents comprise only about 5% of those who have been vaccinated, according to Indiana’s pandemic dashboard. Latino people comprise 6.2% of the state’s population and 2.4% of those who have been vaccinated. Three-quarters of the federal funding must go to support programs that encourage vaccine access and uptake among racial and ethnic minority communities, while 60% must support local health departments and community organizations.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: Iowa State University wants to get as many of its students as possible vaccinated against COVID-19 before the end of the semester, and mass vaccinations will start April 19, ISU leaders told the campus community Tuesday. The announcement came after two weeks of significantly increased numbers of coronavirus cases being reported on campus, with total cases numbering more than double what they had in the weeks since the spring semester started Jan. 25. Mass vaccination is also “a significant step toward our goal of returning to a vibrant campus experience this fall,” according to ISU President Wendy Wintersteen and Erin Baldwin, the university’s leader of student health. The university said last month that it’s planning for classrooms in the fall to be at full capacity with students learning in person, as well as for labs, studios, residence halls, dining, student activities and campus events to return “to pre-pandemic levels.” Decisions about mask-wearing on campus are likely to be made in August.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly said Monday that she has no plans to have the state issue vaccine passports, which are designed to help inoculated residents travel, shop and dine out more freely. The Democratic governor also signed into law a largely symbolic measure approved by the Republican-controlled Legislature to require public schools to offer full-time, in-person classes to all students for the rest of the current semester. Almost all of the state’s 286 local school districts already have most students attending in-person classes, according to the State Department of Education. Vaccine passports verifying people’s immunizations status have become a political flashpoint in the U.S. as they’ve come into use in Israel and under development in Europe. Some Republicans in the U.S. see them as heavy-handed government intrusion. Kelly said she’s concentrating on making sure people get tested for the coronavirus and vaccinated against COVID-19. “I have no interest in vaccine passports,” she told reporters. “We will not be issuing those under my authority.” New COVID-19 cases have declined sharply in Kansas in recent months. State health department data showed an average of just 195 new cases a day for the seven days ending Monday, the lowest rolling seven-day average since late June 2020.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell downplayed a new infusion of federal relief for his home state’s government, questioning the need Monday as the economy looks to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. During a stop in Lexington, McConnell touted federal pandemic aid passed by Congress last year with bipartisan support when the GOP held the Senate and White House. The Kentucky senator was dismissive of the latest round of federal relief championed by Democratic President Joe Biden that passed recently over united opposition from congressional Republicans. State government in Kentucky is expected to eventually receive more than $2.4 billion from the newest federal package. “What we did last year was a big bonus for Kentucky on top of what it needed,” McConnell said. “This is an even bigger bonus. I’m sure they’ll love to have it. But I don’t see that they needed it.” The state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, said he disagreed with the senator’s remarks. The latest round of aid will stimulate job growth and upgrade infrastructure in Kentucky, Beshear said. “It’s a question of: Do you want a long, difficult recession that hurts Kentuckians, that has more people jobless? Or do you want to invest, create jobs and sprint out of this pandemic instead of stumble?” he said at a news conference later Monday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s labor department sent more than $405 million in state and federal unemployment insurance benefits to people who don’t appear to have been eligible for them as the coronavirus pandemic devastated the economy, the state Legislative Auditor’s Office said in a report Monday. The report said an analysis estimates the money was paid to more than 97,500 people who were not eligible, based on their income. The analysis was done using wage reports from employers. A footnote says the amount may be higher because it does not include complete data employers submitted in August or data from self-employed or “gig” workers who don’t report wages to the department. The department in Baton Rouge, known as the Louisiana Workforce Commission, didn’t dispute the report. In a response, it said the pandemic-related surge in applicants and legislative action giving employers more time to submit wage reports affected efforts to verify the accuracy of applicants’ self-reported income. Increased benefits funded through federal legislation passed by Congress last year “greatly incentivized countless criminal enterprises and bad actors to take advantage of already overwhelmed state workforce agencies nationwide,” the department response said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said Monday that the state has updated its pandemic guidelines to allow for more attendance at town meetings next month. The state had been limiting indoor town meetings to 50% of permitted occupancy or 50 people, whichever is greater. That number increases to 75% or permitted occupancy May 24, the governor’s office said. Outdoor town meetings have been limited to 75% of occupancy and will increase to 100% on May 24, the office said. Mills office’ said the rules are “based on the premise that the right to debate and vote as well as public health and safety can be protected with procedures specially designed for elections during the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: All residents 16 and up are eligible to get vaccinated at mass vaccination sites, Gov. Larry Hogan announced. That same group will be allowed to schedule appointments through all providers starting next Monday, the governor said at a news conference. Residents 16 and up represent Phase 3 of the state’s rollout plan. “Appointments for any remaining individuals in Phase 1 or Phase 2 will continue to be prioritized,” Hogan said. “And Marylanders 16 or 17 years of age will only be able to utilize clinics that are providing the Pfizer vaccine, as it is only one that is currently approved by the (Food and Drug Administration) for ages 16 and over.” Hogan underscored that not everyone 16 and over will be able to get vaccinated immediately due to insufficient supply. However, he said over the next few weeks in April and May, state officials believe they will have enough vaccines for people who want them. “And that’s why we’re trying to get an organized process,” Hogan said. “We don’t want to slow down. We want to keep ramping up.” Residents can preregister for an appointment at a mass site online at covidvax.maryland.gov. They can also call Maryland’s COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center at 1-855-634-6829. Maryland has 12 mass vaccination sites available for preregistration, with seven more opening this month.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A sharp-eyed hospital worker is being credited with spotting a shipment of tens of thousands of counterfeit N95 surgical masks that could have potentially put the health of front-line medical workers at risk, officials said Monday. Masks and other protective equipment have been in high demand during the coronavirus pandemic, leading to shortages of many products. James “Barry” O’Shaughnessy, the manager of procurement of South Shore Health in Weymouth with 25 years of experience, recently placed an order for 30,000 masks, but when they arrived, he noticed something was awry. “The labels on the boxes were placed differently than other shipments,” O’Shaughnessy said in a statement. “And the plastic bag inside the boxes had a strange seal. My gut told me something was off.” He asked a 3M representative to help inspect the third-party masks that were not from a 3M-authorized distributor. “I sent 20-30 photos of the product to 3M and the representative confirmed my suspicion. The masks were counterfeit,” he said. The Department of Homeland Security seized the masks and is investigating.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer got her first COVID-19 vaccine shot Tuesday, touting it as the most effective way to protect people and to return Michigan to normalcy. The governor, 49, was vaccinated at Ford Field’s mass clinic alongside her 19-year-old daughter, Sherry, a day after eligibility expanded to everyone ages 16 and older. Whitmer urged parents to ensure their high school- and college-age kids are inoculated, too. The state is facing the country’s highest rate of new coronavirus cases in the past two weeks, which the governor – who does not plan to tighten restrictions – blames on pandemic fatigue, residents’ increased movement and more contagious variants. “I feel good. I feel relieved, to be honest,” Whitmer told reporters after receiving a dose of the Pfizer vaccine from Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state’s chief medical executive. Khaldun said hospitals were treating roughly 3,100 adults with confirmed infections Monday, up nearly 500 from three days before. About half were under age 60. “We are all in this together, no matter your age,” she said, addressing young people in particular. “When you get vaccinated, you’re protecting yourself; you’re protecting your family; you’re protecting your entire community.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday launched an outreach campaign aimed at vaccinating workers in front-line industries in the coming weeks. The outreach effort, part of a broader statewide “Roll Up Your Sleeves, MN” campaign, aims to connect workers in industries like food service with opportunities to get vaccinated at state-run community vaccination sites. The campaign begins this week with workers at restaurants, bars and breweries across the state. “Food service workers have been profoundly impacted by this pandemic,” Walz said in a release. “While we’ve expanded vaccine eligibility, we are still focused on immunizing for impact and the priority populations we identified early in this process.” As of Sunday, more than 1.8 million Minnesotans have received at least one dose of vaccine, and nearly 1.2 million have been fully vaccinated. At least 42% of Minnesotans 16 and older have received one dose, including 83% of people 65 and older. The Minnesota Department of Health on Tuesday reported 3,014 new coronavirus cases and four COVID-19 deaths, which represent cases and deaths for both Monday and Tuesday after the state did not release an update Sunday due to the Easter holiday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has now administered 1.32 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to residents, according to the health department. As of Monday, 815,673 people have received at least one vaccine dose, and 541,241 more are fully vaccinated. Everyone over the age of 16 in the state is eligible to receive a vaccine. People can be inoculated at state-run drive-thru sites, as well as at community health centers, some pharmacies and private health care providers. The Mississippi State Department of Health said Tuesday that the state of approximately 3 million residents has reported at least 306,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 7,000 deaths from COVID-19 as of Monday evening. While most people who contract the coronavirus recover after suffering only mild to moderate symptoms, it can be deadly for older patients and those with other health problems. People eligible to receive the vaccine can make an appointment at COVIDvaccine.umc.edu or by calling the COVID-19 call center at 1-877-978-6453.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The University of Missouri is planning to have full-capacity, in-person classes and activities on the Columbia campus for the fall semester beginning in August, university officials announced Tuesday. University President Mun Choi said in a news release that MU officials will stay in touch with local health officials as they plan for football, concerts and classes. The university had 13 active student coronavirus cases as of Tuesday, Choi said. Some faculty and staff are already working on campus, and all are expected to be back by May 17 to prepare for the full-capacity return this fall. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Missouri has held steady over the past 14 days at about 590. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that 28.5% of the population had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine as of Monday, and 16.5% had been fully vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Gov. Greg Gianforte has continued to show mild systems after testing positive for the coronavirus over the weekend. Gianforte’s office disclosed Monday evening that he had been tested after experiencing unspecified symptoms a day earlier. His office said he notified all of his close contacts since his last public event Thursday. Those contacts were with a staff member, a member of his security detail, family members, and friends with whom he had dinner, spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said. Gianforte received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine Thursday and had been tested regularly since he was sworn into office in January. Vaccinations can take some time before they are fully effective. First lady Susan Gianforte has not exhibited symptoms but was also tested and awaiting results. Gianforte planned to isolate for 10 days on the advice of his doctor and public health guidance. All of his in-person events have been canceled. But he will “continue to conduct his duties and manage the state’s business from his home in Bozeman,” his office said in a statement. Since taking office in January, Gianforte has lifted a mask mandate imposed by his predecessor and eased other restrictions intended to curb the spread of the virus. He’s touted personal responsibility and had kept a mask mandate in place for his own office.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: More than 120,000 residents were vaccinated against COVID-19 last week, up from roughly 106,000 the week before. The state has now opened up vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 and older, but health officials in Lancaster County are still prioritizing older residents at this point. More than one-quarter of all Nebraskans over age 16 have been vaccinated. But the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has risen over the past two weeks from 259.71 new cases per day March 21 to 486.43 new cases per day Sunday. And the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in the state has crept up to 148 over the past week after bottoming out at 102 on March 29. The state said Tuesday that 212,257 cases and 2,183 deaths have been reported since the pandemic began. Nearly 350,000 Nebraskans have registered with the state online to receive a vaccine.\n\nNevada\n\nHenderson: U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto on Monday encouraged people to shop on the state’s health insurance exchange to determine if they can get cheaper coverage thanks to the new federal coronavirus relief law. The Democratic senator held a news conference in Henderson to promote the benefits of the relief law signed by President Joe Biden last month. Cortez Masto said the law increases subsidies for 60,000 Nevadans who are already receiving them to help pay for their health insurance on the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. She said the law also makes 40,000 other people eligible for subsidies and anyone receiving unemployment benefits eligible for free monthly premiums and help paying co-pays and deductibles. “What this means is that if you already have a plan, there’s a good chance it’s cheaper. And if you found coverage to be unaffordable up to this point, you could be eligible for discounted coverage or even a plan that is free to you,” Cortez Masto said. Officials with Silver State Health Insurance Exchange said the new rates and assistance should begin showing up on the online system at the end of the month. The rates and assistance will be effective from May 1 through the end of the year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nWarner: Those who attended events at a small Catholic college in town around Easter are being asked to get tested for the coronavirus after an outbreak infected at least 16 people. Anyone who attended events and services between March 21 and April 4 at Magdalen College of the Liberal Arts – including Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday – may have been exposed and should seek testing, the Department of Health and Human Services said Tuesday. The department also is conducting contact tracing. The campus is currently closed to the public. Meanwhile, contact tracing is underway after a member of Gov. Chris Sununu’s office tested positive for the virus. The employee, who has not been in the office since Thursday, tested positive Monday after experiencing minor symptoms over the weekend. One person who was determined to have been a close contact is quarantining. Sununu was not determined to have been a close contact. This is the second confirmed case of COVID-19 within the governor’s office. Another staff member tested positive in early December.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Residents with the most severe disabilities are regressing physically and mentally because the therapy, socialization and training programs on which they depend have been closed for more than a year. Many are depressed and stuck at home with families at their breaking points while the state is unfairly barring them from needed services, according to families, advocates and some lawmakers. These services, which come bundled under the catchall title of day programs, offer therapy, social activities, job training and classes. Except six weeks last fall, they’ve been shuttered since March 2020 in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19. But the state’s unilateral decision to do so has resulted in hardship for many individuals and their caretakers. Republican state Sen. Anthony Bucco “strongly” urged Gov. Phil Murphy in a letter to “reconsider the reopening protocols” that require a higher bar for getting these programs restarted than schools, businesses and other organizations. “Strangely, these requirements are far more strict than those that apply to public schools, and will prevent most of the day programs from reopening,” he wrote.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: The state has reported that oil and gas production increased by more than 10% last year compared to 2019 even as demand for fuel dropped during the coronavirus pandemic. Data from the state’s oil conservation division showed the state produced about 370 million barrels of oil in 2020 compared to about 330 million barrels of oil produced in 2019. Although last year produced the highest amount of oil since the division began tracking production in the 1970s, officials said rate of growth dropped from a 33% increase between 2018, which yielded about 250 million barrels of oil, and 2019. New Mexico also produced about 1.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, surpassing the 2001 record of 1.6 trillion cubic feet, according to data. However, natural gas production growth also declined, increasing about 7% between 2019 and last year compared to 19% between 2018 and 2019. An annual report by the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association on revenue for the state by the industry said $2.8 billion was generated last year, including $1.4 billion for public education. The amount was second to the record $3.1 billion of state revenue generated in 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Residents over 16 years old can sign up for COVID-19 vaccinations starting Tuesday, a major expansion of eligibility as the state seeks to immunize as many people as possible. The State University of New York also announced plans to offer vaccines to tens of thousands of college students before they head home for the summer. Gov. Andrew Cuomo expanded eligibility to 30 and over last week and announced that people 16 to 29 would be eligible starting April 6. Teens 16 and 17 years old will be limited to receiving the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the only one that has been authorized for use by people under 18. Parental consent will be required for vaccinations of those minors at state-run sites, with certain exceptions including for teens who are married or are parents. None of the available vaccines has yet been approved for people under 16. New York state health officials hope that increased eligibility will help cut down COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations – particularly among millennials and Generation Xers.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nNags Head: The ferry service that carries passengers to the Outer Banks is facing a shortage of deck hands, seamen and captains. The Virginian-Pilot reports there’s often a waiting list to get a ferry job. But this year the service needs to fill an expanded summer schedule. Jed Dixon, deputy director of the North Carolina Ferry Division, said it’s having a “harder time than I can remember finding people.” Dixon said the pandemic prevented an annual job fair that typically helps recruit enough employees. But people could simply be choosing other careers. With a system of 22 ferries on seven routes, North Carolina has the second-largest ferry system in the nation. About 2 million people ride the vessels each year across the state’s waterways between the Outer Banks and the mainland. The ferry service needs roughly 20 more employees. “While there’s always a chance we might not be able to run the full summer schedule if we don’t get the crews, the ferry division is doing everything humanly possible to not let that happen,” spokesman Tim Hass said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: More than 20 North Dakota State University nursing and pharmacy students are volunteering to help “Protect the Herd” during on-campus COVID-19 vaccination clinics for students, faculty and staff, using the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. “I made the choice to get my COVID-19 vaccine to protect myself and others, and I chose to volunteer administering COVID-19 vaccines at NDSU because I want to be able to assist others on campus in protecting themselves and others as well,” said NDSU nursing student Aaron Dwyer, who will graduate this year, after which he has accepted a job to work in an oncology unit at a Fargo hospital. Students are trained in vaccination techniques, said Dr. Amy Werremeyer, chair of NDSU School of Pharmacy and a preceptor for the events. “Students get to combine skills they’ve learned in the classroom such as vaccine administration technique, infection control, public health principles, process management and improvement. ... Not only do they get to combine those skills, they get to see them applied in action, which is invaluable as a learning opportunity.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A group representing Asian American neighbors of the Republican lieutenant governor said Monday that he and his family have agreed to meet with them to discuss their concerns about his recent tweet that referred to the coronavirus as the “Wuhan virus.” Lt. Gov. Jon Husted’s office didn’t immediately return a call seeking to confirm the meeting with residents of Upper Arlington. The group said it is scheduled to meet him Friday. Asian American residents of the Columbus suburb wrote to Husted last week outlining their concerns over the tweet. They want to use the meeting to express how his words affected them during a time when there is an uptick in attacks against members of the Asian American community. “Your choice of words has only raised the anxiety and fear that Asians and Asian Americans in Upper Arlington are currently experiencing,” the March 31 letter said. “Our children have been targeted for bullying and abuse in the district well before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that abuse has increased significantly in the last 14 months and has reached levels that have brought news media attention to our doorsteps.” The letter to Husted has now been signed by more than 80 community members and families, up from the 60 original names.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Choctaw Nation on Monday announced plans to provide COVID-19 vaccines to the general public, becoming the latest tribe based in the state to expand vaccine distribution beyond its own citizens. The Durant-based tribe also announced it is partnering with a new national database, Dr. B, that allows people to be put on standby to receive unused doses of the vaccine. “We realize, to best protect our tribal members, we need to vaccinate the communities in which they live,” said Todd Hallmark, executive officer of health services for the Choctaw Nation. Native American tribes in Oklahoma have been receiving separate allocations of vaccines from the federal government, and the Chickasaw and Muscogee (Creek) nations have previously announced plans to make some of their allocation available to the general public. Oklahoma health officials announced 226 confirmed new coronavirus cases and 29 new deaths Monday. That brings the total number of confirmed infections in the state to more than 440,000 and the state’s death count to 7,961. After weeks of declining numbers, the seven-day rolling averages of daily new cases and daily deaths have both increased in Oklahoma over the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: All residents 16 and older will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine April 19, Gov. Kate Brown announced Tuesday morning. The news coincided with an expected announcement from President Joe Biden on Tuesday that he is accelerating the deadline for states to open up COVID-19 vaccinations to every adult in the U.S. by April 19, a White House official said. Last week officials warned of a fourth COVID-19 wave, expressing concerns about coronavirus variants and the increase in cases. Brown described the coming weeks as a “critical moment for all to double down so we can outrun this next wave.” Officials say Oregon will pass the threshold of 2 million vaccines administered Tuesday and is focused on vaccinating as many front-line workers and people with underlying conditions as possible in the next two weeks. “And yet, in communities across Oregon, COVID-19 is spreading at concerning rates. We must move as quickly as possible to get more shots in arms,” Brown said in a statement Tuesday. People of color, who have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, make up a large percentage of those groups, said Brown, a Democrat.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Fewer state residents are getting tested for the coronavirus, making it harder to detect and counter a potential fourth wave of the pandemic, Acting Secretary of Health Alison Beam said Tuesday. Just 34,887 tests were administered Monday, according to the latest figures available from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Daily testing is down 55% from a high point of 79,237 tests recorded Dec. 3. “Despite the number of cases rising, we’re seeing the demand for testing decrease,” Beam said. “We need to redouble efforts to increase testing even as we ramp up the vaccine process.” More than 14.3 million tests have been administered in a state with a population of 12.8 million. But that doesn’t mean everyone has been tested. Some may have been tested multiple times. “We know that the number of COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania and across the country has been on the rise,” Beam said. “We need people to continue to be vigilant. Testing is the most effective way to identify and contain the virus.” With testing, officials also hope to be able to track variants of the bug that has so far claimed the lives of 25,237 state residents. Testing in K-12 schools will be “prioritized next,” said Beam, who could offer no further details Tuesday on those plans.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University on Tuesday joined a growing number of colleges that will require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before returning for in-person classes next fall. “Starting in the Fall 2021 semester, Brown will require COVID-19 vaccines for all undergraduate, graduate and medical students who will be on campus or engage in any level of in-person instruction,” Christina Paxson, president of the Ivy League school, wrote in a letter to the campus community posted online. Medical and religious exemptions will be allowed. The university is still weighing whether to require employees to be vaccinated. That decision is expected in the summer. The Providence school anticipates a return to a more traditional pre-pandemic academic experience for the 2021-22 school year, including standard occupancy for student residences, as well as expanded dining and recreation options on campus, she said. “This year has been difficult for so many members of our community as the months of this pandemic have stretched on, and I know we all look forward to a greater return to normal,” Paxson wrote. “Although aspects of our lives will continue to be influenced by public health considerations for quite some time, I am looking toward next year with a sense of optimism.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is getting a $47 million federal boost to its COVID-19 vaccination programs, particularly in minority communities. The award announced Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is intended to shore up local efforts to expand vaccine deployment. Officials say 75% of the total funding has to go toward programs and initiatives aimed at getting more vaccines into racial and ethnic minority communities. As an example, the CDC said the money could go toward training people to go door-to-door in their own areas, raise vaccine awareness and help people sign up for appointments. Funds could also be used to hire community health workers focusing on bilingual outreach. Black residents – who comprise about 27% of the state’s population – represent only 17% of South Carolinians who have gotten at least one vaccine dose, according to state health officials. Numbers are even lower among Latino residents. The award – part of $3 billion in total funding going to dozens of jurisdictions across the country – comes from the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package that President Joe Biden signed into law last month.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem marked the occasion of the state opening vaccines to adults 16 and older Monday by receiving her first dose. The governor, who has taken a mostly hands-off approach to restrictions during the pandemic, has encouraged people to get inoculated, saying she is “trusting people to do the right thing.” Health officials reported that 46% of the state’s population has received one dose of a vaccine. South Dakota also has one of the nation’s highest rates of people fully vaccinated – about 25% of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rolling average number of daily new infections has also decreased by about 10% over the past two weeks. However, health officials have warned that new variants of the coronavirus spread infections more easily.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A phone line that offers callers mental health support during the COVID-19 pandemic has added an option to talk via text messaging. The state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services says the Emotional Support Line for Pandemic Stress now lets people call or text the line at 888-642-7886 from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. CDT daily. The line is set up for health care workers, first responders and all Tennesseans working in education to talk with mental health professionals about their work-related stress, anxiety, sadness or depression. The line was created in May 2020.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott used his executive power Tuesday to ban state government and some private entities from requiring COVID-19 “vaccine passports” to access services, in the latest move from a Republican governor pitting public health campaigns against personal freedom and private choices. According to Abbott’s order, state agencies and political subdivisions and public and private organizations that receive public funding in Texas cannot require people to show proof that they have been inoculated against the disease caused by the coronavirus. The mandate also says it will supersede any conflicting local executive orders and calls for the Legislature to take up COVID-19 vaccine requirements during its current session. “We will continue to vaccinate more Texans and protect public health – and we will do so without treading on Texans’ personal freedoms,” Abbott said in a statement announcing the order. Abbott said the U.S. Constitution does not empower the federal government to mandate proof of vaccination. The White House has ruled out a national “vaccine passport,” saying it is leaving it to the private sector to develop a system for people show they’ve been vaccinated.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A new law blocks the state’s government from requiring people to get COVID-19 vaccines, but companies can use so-called vaccine passports to determine who has been inoculated. The Legislature passed the measure blocking vaccine requirements, and Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed it last month, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Vaccine passports would theoretically allow people who have been inoculate to travel, shop, dine in restaurants and attend sporting events with fewer restrictions. Many of the passports being developed are smartphone apps with a code that will verify vaccination, the Tribune reports. The Washington Post reports that at least 17 companies are working to develop the passports. “If we’re talking pure policy, I don’t think we should have vaccine passports or mask mandates now that people are being protected against the virus,” said Republican Utah Rep. Robert Spendlove, who sponsored the bill preventing vaccine requirements. Spendlove said now that COVID-19 shots are more widely available, he doesn’t see the need for vaccine passports, but he won’t try to push restrictions on their use for businesses. The law also blocks state colleges and universities from requiring COVID-19 vaccinations for students and employees. Private schools can still require them.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott on Monday condemned the “racist response” to his administration’s decision to make members of ethnic minorities eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine before residents of other races. The state granted preferential vaccine access April 1 to the BIPOC community – Black, Indigenous and people of color – and anyone living in their households. The Republican governor called their disparity in vaccination rates compared to non-Hispanic whites “unacceptable.” About 20% of the former population has received at least one dose of a vaccine, compared with an about 33% vaccination rate for the latter, Scott said in a statement Monday. “In addition to the greater risk of hospitalization among BIPOC community members, the pace of vaccination for these individuals is too far behind the white population,” Scott said in the statement. He said his office, the state Health Department and vaccine providers have recently been subjected “to vitriolic and inappropriate comments in social media and other forums” over the decision. “And it is evidence that many Americans, and many Vermonters, still have a lot to learn about the impacts of racism in our country and how it has influenced public policy over the years,” he said in the statement.\n\nVirginia\n\nVerona: The tide of coronavirus cases at Middle River Regional Jail has dwindled after a winter of managing a serious outbreak, with the facility now beginning to vaccinate inmates. According to Superintendent Jeffrey Newton and Dr. Laura Kornegay, the director of Central Shenandoah Health District, inmates at MRRJ were being vaccinated Monday with the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot, which helps ease complications with scheduling. “As a one-shot series, this will eliminate efforts at trying to coordinate second doses for persons who leave the jail in the coming weeks,” Kornegay said. Kornegay said the inmate population is a part of the category 1B vaccination effort, but given the large amount of people in the category and the logistics of coordinating inoculation in a jail, it has taken months to get a clinic set up for MRRJ. The clinic is a step in the right direction for the facility, but it will still have a long way to go before operations can return to normal. “MRRJ would need a significant number of inmates to take the vaccine, and herd immunity would need to exist in our communities to change our current intake protocol and how MRRJ is currently managing the inmate population,” Newton said. Kornegay said acceptance of vaccines in inmate populations is typically low.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted to give free legal representation to renters facing eviction. Advocates say the legislation is a small investment that will help people stay in their homes and forestall the more expensive consequences of homelessness, The Seattle Times reports. It passed unanimously last week with a notable change from Council President M. Lorena Gonzalez making the offer available to tenants who are “indigent,” broadly defined as someone unable to pay for a lawyer for the eviction proceeding. No documentation would be necessary, beyond the person signing a form saying they couldn’t afford a lawyer. Gonzalez said the change was necessary to ensure the law survives legal challenges and is in line with similar city policies, like the city’s legal defense fund for local immigrants facing deportation. Councilmember Kshama Sawant, the measure’s lead sponsor, opposed the change, arguing any sort of income eligibility requirement was demeaning and would result in fewer people accessing the service. Gonzalez’s amendment passed 8-1. Local studies have shown that the most common reason for eviction is lack of payment of rent, and it’s often just a small debt. Having a lawyer, advocates say, can slow the process and help tenants access services like rental assistance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University will return to in-person commencement ceremonies for 4,500 graduating students in May. Four separate ceremonies will be held May 15-16 at Milan Puskar Stadium in Morgantown, WVU said in a news release. Some restrictions will be in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. Masks and social distancing will be required. All participants must register. Tickets will be required for admission, the statement said. In addition to the latest graduates, students who graduated in May, August and December 2020 also will be eligible to participate in the exercises, the statement said. Dr. Patrice Harris, the first African American woman to chair the American Medical Association’s Board of Trustees, will speak at all four ceremonies.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The COVID-19 vaccination center at the Alliant Energy Center will be able to increase the number of doses delivered by 2,100 a week thanks to new staffing support from the federal government starting Wednesday, Gov. Tony Evers announced. The site will become the third in Wisconsin run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, which also runs a mass vaccination clinic at the Wisconsin Center in downtown Milwaukee. Another FEMA-run mass vaccination clinic opens Thursday at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire’s Zorn Arena. The state has committed to supplying 7,000 doses of vaccine a week at the Madison center, which has the capacity to inoculate 1,400 people per day, the governor’s office said Tuesday. The additional 26 staff from the federal government will allow for 2,100 more doses to be administered per week, depending on supply, on top of the 5,600 weekly doses currently, Evers’ office said. The mass clinic opened in late December. “This is one of the largest vaccination efforts our state has undertaken and it takes teamwork at every level to ensure we are getting vaccine to everyone as quickly, fairly, and safely as possible,” Evers said in a statement.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state’s unemployment rate ticked up in February, reversing a downward trend that tracked last year’s easing of coronavirus public health orders. The February rate was 5.3%, up from 5.1% in January and 5.2% in December, according to the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services. Wyoming’s unemployment rate reached 8.5% last May but fell over the summer, reaching 5.4% in October, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wyoming’s rate this past February was nearly 1 point lower than the U.S. average, 6.2%. Wyoming still had about 15,000 fewer jobs than it did a year earlier, however. Unemployment rates increased in 15 of Wyoming’s 23 counties in February. They fell in five counties and remained steady in three, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Natrona County, a hub of Wyoming’s still-suffering fossil fuel industries, had Wyoming’s highest unemployment rate, 8.9%, followed by Sublette (8.8%) and Sweetwater (7.6%) counties. Teton (4.4%), Albany (4.5%) and Crook (4.5%) counties had the lowest unemployment.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/07"}]}

Here it is.", "text": "In late November, we told the origins of the Claymont Christmas Weed, an enduring Delaware holiday tradition that began 25 years ago and continues to this day.\n\nEvery December since 1993, local residents decorate a \"weed\" with shiny ornaments and then display it on Philadelphia Pike near I-495.\n\nAn annual parade, held the first Saturday in December celebrating the weed, followed in 1998.\n\nThe weed story took root, so to speak, after a photo by the late Donaghey Brown of a scraggly little Christmas tree appeared on the front page of The News Journal on Dec. 17, 1993.\n\nThe headline read: \"O Christmas Weed.\"\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThen, that same morning, the Delaware Department of Transportation chopped it down in the interest of safety, though some found it particularly Scrooge-y.\n\nBut the photo of the little tree moved Delaware residents, particularly those living in Claymont.\n\nThey soon put up a new tree – only to see it quickly stolen by thieves. Eight trees later, The News Journal hired a local security company to watch over the tree on Christmas Eve.\n\nFormer reporter/editor Al Mascitti wrote a touching fable about the plucky little tree and called it \"The Christmas Weed.\" It first appeared in The News Journal on Dec. 25, 1993, and was reprinted the following year.\n\nThis year, readers have called and sent emails asking for a reprint of Mascitti's fable.\n\nWhile the Christmas Weed looks much different today than it did in 1993, the sentiment of resiliency is still the same.\n\nTo celebrate the Christmas Weed's 25th anniversary, which should resonate with a new generation, we're sharing the fable again. (See below.)\n\nBut, first, a few letters from our readers:\n\nChristmas Weed brings a smile\n\nI just moved to Claymont, Delaware, and love learning about the area. I saw your article and smiled. I tried to read the fable, but it is very blurry and can't make out the words. Would it be possible to publish it in a readable format?\n\nThank you for the smile on my face on these cold rainy days.\n\nMichelle Morris (Imported from Arkansas)\n\nFable made reader cry\n\nI was wondering how I could obtain a copy of \"The Christmas Weed\" (fable) by Al Mascitti from Dec. 25, 1993. I lived in Claymont for 27 years beginning in 1977. I had a copy 25 years ago, but have misplaced it.\n\nThe first time I read it tears rolled down my face.\n\nThank you for your help,\n\nNancy Brown\n\n'Christmas Weed,' a family tradition\n\nToday, I read with great interest your article about the Christmas Weed. When it first appeared in 1993, my two grandsons were 2- and 4-years-old and coming for the first time to Delaware for Christmas.\n\nI had saved the article and read it to them and the adults, too. In the following years, there were two more grandchildren to hear the story. It became a family tradition to hear it every Christmas. Those two grandsons are now 27 and 29, and the article is yellow with age. I stapled it in a manila folder for safe keeping.\n\nThis year, I visited them in Texas for Thanksgiving. I presented the folder to their father, my son, in hopes of keeping this family tradition alive. I want to thank you for reminding us all, that \"The Christmas Weed\" is alive and cherished by many in addition to our family.\n\nI am sending your article to my son to preserve with the original article.\n\nThank you again,\n\nMarjorie Mounts\n\nSettle in with a few holiday cookies and enjoy the heart-warming tale:\n\nThe Christmas Weed\n\nA fable of how the holiday spirit sprouted\n\nBy Al Mascitti\n\nOnce upon a time a little seed grew on a plant high on a hill. From there it could see for miles. It looked down on woods and meadows, fields and streams. Its favorite sight was a spot on the hill below, where many fir trees grew, hundreds of them in long straight lines, row after row after row.\n\n\"Why do those trees grow that way?\" the little seed asked.\n\n\"That is a Christmas tree farm,\" its mother explained. \"When the trees grow big enough and the weather grows cold, people will come to bring them inside their houses. There they'll be covered with lights and tinsel and shiny glass balls. Everyone will gather 'round to open gifts and sing happy songs. Christmas trees make people very happy, and they are remembered with joy.\"\n\n\"That's what I would like to be someday,\" the little seed said. \"A Christmas tree.\"\n\nOne windy day, the little seed and all its brothers and sisters left the hill and drifted into the sky, looking for their own spots to take root.\n\nSome dropped on the hill near their mother. Some fell in gullies, some on the banks of brooks and creeks. But the little seed kept going, looking for a special place to grow.\n\nSoon the seed saw a wide, wide river. \"I would like to see the other side,\" he said, but suddenly the wind died, and the little seed dropped.\n\nIt landed in a spot where the ground was hard, gray and grimy.\n\nThe little seed spent a lonely night. Nothing green was anywhere around. No other plants kept him company. He knew he could never grow here.\n\nThe next day it rained, and the water carried the little seed into a tiny crack in the road, for a road was where he was. Cars and trucks kept whizzing by, making a horrible noise and filling the air with soot. But in the crack was a little bit of dirt, and the little seed knew it was time to sprout.\n\nWhen he did, he saw he was not alone. He shared his tiny crevice with several other little seedlings.\n\n\"Who are you?\" asked the little seed, now a sprout.\n\n\"We're weeds, just like you,\" said the hungry little plants.\n\n\"I'm not a weed,\" said the little sprout. \"I'm going to be a Christmas tree someday.\"\n\nThe weeds laughed and laughed. \"A Christmas tree?\" they said. \"You can't be a Christmas tree. A Christmas tree takes years to grow. They're big and bushy and beautiful, and they never turn brown – they're always green. You're just a scraggly little weed, like us. When the winter comes you will die.\"\n\nThe little sprout didn't care what the weeds said. He would grow and grow and he would be a Christmas tree someday.\n\nSo through the rains of April and the winds of May and the sunshine of June, he grew. The cars and trucks kept speeding past.\n\nWhen the blazing sun of July made other seeds dry up, the little sprout kept growing.\n\nThe thunderstorms of August washed other weeds away, but still the little sprout grew.\n\nBy September, only the sprout was left. Except now he wasn't a sprout anymore.\n\nFrom his reflection in the passing hubcaps, he could see he had the shape of a proud little Christmas tree sapling.\n\nIn October, the days grew shorter, and the little sapling stopped growing.\n\nIn November, the nights grew cold, and he knew it was almost time. Still, nobody came to take him home.\n\nBut the little plant never gave up hope. Soon, he knew, someone would decorate him and sing songs around him, and he would give people joy.\n\nBut December came, and the little plant felt something happening. His leaves were curling up and turning brown.\n\nThe other weeds had been right. He was not a Christmas tree. He was nothing but a weed. He felt sad and tired. Suddenly he knew he was going to die.\n\nThen something unexpected happened. Instead of speeding past, one of the cars stopped beside him.\n\nThe person inside got out and hung something on the little weed's branches – something soft and shiny and sparkling in the sun.\n\nThe next day another car stopped, and then another. People added shiny balls of red and white, little red ribbons and chains of gold.\n\nThe little weed was very tired now, but he held his browning branches as high as he could. And when a big truck stopped next to him, he could see from his reflection in the hubcaps that he looked just like a Christmas tree.\n\n\"Yank that weed out of there,\" he heard a man say. Finally, he thought, someone had come to take him home.\n\nHe would go inside, where people would gather 'round him to open gifts and sing songs. He was so happy he didn't even mind when rough hands grabbed him and pulled him up and threw him on the truck.\n\n\"There,\" the man said. \"Now this bridge is bare, as it should be.\"\n\nBut the little weed didn't go to somebody's home. The truck stopped near a big fire, and the little weed was thrown on top.\n\nSo he had failed after all, he thought. He would never get to hear the songs, or see the happy faces of children opening gifts.\n\nAs the roaring flames touched his dry, brown leaves and carried them toward heaven, he understood his folly. What made him, a common weed, think he could ever bring anyone joy?\n\nBut as the little weed looked down, he could see the bridge where he had sprouted and grown.\n\nDespite what the man said, it wasn't bare. It was full of people bringing Christmas trees – real trees with soft, green branches and garlands of red and gold.\n\nSome people liked the trees so much they took them home. But every time a tree disappeared, a new and bigger one took its place. People came from miles and miles around to see the spot where the spirit of Christmas would not die.\n\nThen the little weed saw that what made a Christmas tree wasn't being taken inside, or opening gifts or singing songs.\n\nAs his ashes swirled into the clouds, the little plant was happy. At last he knew that even a weed could make people happy. And that he would be remembered with joy.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nMORE CHRISTMAS STORIES:\n\nClaymont Christmas Weed has a wacky, 25-year history\n\nSanta's Mailbox a Fairfax tradition for 60 plus years\n\n'The real deal': The story behind the Concord Mall Santa who melted our hearts on Facebook\n\nYour 2018 guide to Christmas lights across Delaware", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/06/04/delaware-juneteenth-associations-fifth-annual-flag-raising-ceremony/73957104007/", "title": "Delaware Juneteenth Associations fifth annual flag raising ceremony", "text": "The federal observance of Juneteenth is a few weeks ahead, yet the festivities marking the holiday have already commenced. The fiftth annual flag-raising ceremony organized by the Delaware Juneteenth Association marked the beginning of events honoring the Black American tradition of commemorating the day when enslaved people in Texas learned about their freedom.\n\nThe flag-raising ceremony was attended by several elected officials and community leaders, including Delaware Gov. John Carney, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, New Castle County Council President Karen M. Hartley Nagle and state Rep. Sherry Dorsey-Walker.\n\nBuffalo Soldier reenactors raised the official Juneteenth and American flags. Sylvia Lewis-Harris, co-founder of the Delaware Juneteenth Association, said their inclusion was intentional. According to Lewis-Harris, the enslaved people of Texas learned about their freedom — two years after the Emancipation Proclamation — only at the insistence of Buffalo Soldiers.\n\n\"The U.S. colored troops are the ones that delivered that message. They told [Granger], 'This is important and you will do it or we will do it,\" Lewis-Harris said. \"[Granger] didn't want them to do it, so he did it.\"\n\nThe ceremony also featured a reading of General Granger's General Order No. 3 issued on June 19, 1865. It declared the freedom of all slaves and that the new relationship between master and slave would now be employer and employee.\n\nThe people are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property, between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them, become that between employer and hired labor. The freed are advised to remain at their present homes, and work for wages...\n\nLewis-Harris explained that reading the general order during the ceremony serves to educate individuals who may not be fully aware of the significant role Black Americans played in shaping the nation's history.\n\nCarney, a guest speaker at the event, acknowledged that while growing up in Claymont, he received little education about Black Americans in American history until he took a college course. State Rep. Stephanie T. Bolden, a former educator noted that the bill Carney signed into law in 2021 — mandating the inclusion of Black history and experiences in the K-12 curriculum of all public schools in Delaware — has yet to be implemented.\n\nCelebrating its 30th anniversary this year, the Delaware Juneteenth Association was founded in 1994 by Delaware native Bernie Wilkins. It is the longest-running organization in the state dedicated to honoring Juneteenth.\n\nEvents marking Juneteenth this month\n\nThe Delaware Juneteenth Association will be commemorating the holiday with this series of events:\n\nFreedom Parade and Festival in the Park - Saturday, June 15\n\nParade kickoff - 11 a.m. at Rodney Square in Wilmington\n\nFestival begins at noon at Tubman-Garrett Park in Wilmington.

He has performed and taught in multiple countries, and ballet regularly brings him to Wilmington from Germany, his home since 1972.\n\nHe’s helping with “Coppélia and Other Ballets,” a recital to be presented at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Laird Performing Arts Center at The Tatnall School. It includes eight pieces by students, as young as 4 and as old as him. The show kicks off a year-long celebration of the school’s 60th anniversary.\n\nHutchinson was 15 when he started studying ballet. In 1956, dancer, teacher and choreographer James Jamieson and dancer Helene Antonova opened the Academy of the Dance. A few weeks after Hutchinson started classes there, he was offered a scholarship. He studied at the academy until 1960.\n\n“Madame Antonova and Mr. Jamieson were my mentors. They gave me a respect for the way people live. I owe them a great deal,” he said in explaining his recurring returns to Delaware, including a 15-year run as Uncle Drosselmeyer in the “Nutcracker,” a holiday tradition for the troupe since 1967.\n\nAs a mentor himself, he is concerned about the future of this art form. “To succeed, you need the four D’s: discipline, dedication, determination and desire. And I also add a P – passion.”\n\nNot many students have all four, he said, and too many are torn between too many after-school activities.\n\n“On Monday, it’s ballet. Tuesday, it’s karate, and Wednesday, it’s piano. I call it dabbling. It’s like instant coffee. You stir it into hot water and call it coffee. It’s not.”\n\nHutchinson said you could see the dabbling in the way some dress.\n\n“In the old days, students were ready with black leotards and white tights and their hair pulled up,” he said. “Today’s they coming in pink tutus. It’s becoming a costume festival.”\n\nHe studied ballet six days a week. He was told to read books, listen to classical music, go to museums “to open your mind to culture” and take walks “because nature is more beautiful.”\n\nHe aced those D’s and developed a career, including 16 years for the Bremen Opera as ballet master and assistant director. In 1995, he was asked to return as artistic adviser to the academy.\n\nThe offer came from Victor Wesley, another former student and then the owner. (Antonova died in 1974, Jamieson in 1993.) In 2008, when Wesley returned to Scotland, the school became a nonprofit.\n\nSo how does his tough love play in class?\n\n“The students crave it,” said Beth Moore, co-director with Tara Agne. “They love being challenged. They love being told ‘I know this is hard, but you can do it.’”\n\nAgne noted that ballet classes benefit students in multiple ways. “It teaches focus and concentration, and it teaches kids to work together.”\n\nHutchinson has other concerns about the future of ballet in America. The country’s culture is “sports-brainwashed,” as contrasted to higher-brow Europe. Children are spending too much time in front of phones and computers. And they tend to devote fewer years to studying ballet than Europeans.\n\nStill, “when I see a person with talent, I nurture it. When God gave you talent, not to use it is a sin.”\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Wilmington Ballet Spring Performance\n\nWhere: Tatnall School, 1501 Barley Mill Road, Greenville\n\nWhen: 2 p.m. Sunday\n\nTickets: $15 at door\n\nFor more information: (302) 655-1004; www.wilmingtonballet.org", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2019/10/29/green-room-wilmingtons-hotel-du-pont-likely-renamed/4063585002/", "title": "Iconic Green Room at Wilmington's Hotel du Pont will likely be ...", "text": "The beloved macaroons are staying, but the name of the Hotel du Pont's iconic Green Room will likely change when the restaurant is redesigned in 2020, Delaware Online/The News Journal has learned.\n\nThe Buccini-Pollin Group, the Wilmington-based real estate acquisition, development and management company, purchased the historic downtown Wilmington hotel from the DuPont Co. in 2017.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2018/03/07/celebrate-saint-patricks-day-family-style-delaware/394551002/", "title": "Celebrate St. Patrick's Day family-style in Delaware", "text": "It's not hard to find a spot to grab a Guinness and shot of Irish whiskey in Delaware over the next two weekends, but spotting family-friendly St. Patrick's Day celebrations across the state can be a bit tougher.\n\nFrom parades and festivals to concerts and 5Ks, there's more than just beer-stained bashes for those who want to get their Irish on.\n\nAnd with clear skies and temperatures expected in the mid- to upper-40s this weekend, folks will be ready to welcome a taste of spring after dealing with this week's sleet-bomb of a winter storm.\n\nIn Wilmington, the 14th annual Turners Irish Festival will be held on Saturday, March 10, from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., hosted by the American Turners of Delaware (701 S.

Go to miltonstpatricksdayparade.com for complete details.\n\nFounded by the town's Irish Eyes location, the parade that follows doubles as a fundraiser for local causes, along with the 5k.\n\nThis year's beneficiaries are the Milton Fire Department, Milton Chamber of Commerce and the Gladys Wilkins Seeding the Future Scholarship Fund, which awards scholarships to Sussex County students who want to pursue a career in sustainable agriculture.\n\nThe parade kicks off at Del. 5 and Atlantic Avenue, heading south and concluding at Milton Elementary School (512 Federal St.)\n\nIf you're looking for a bite or a pint of Guinness, Irish Eyes will be bustling post-parade and Mike & The Fellow Travelers led by Mike O'Loughlin will be playing, starting at 4 p.m.\n\nOn Sunday, March 11, Smyrna-Clayton St. Patrick's Day Parade has its turn in the sun starting at 2 p.m. at Saint Polycarp Church (55 Ransom Lane).\n\nTrack the parade up High Street to West Commerce Street, ending at North Smyrna Elementary School (365 N Main St.) This year's plaques will be awarded at the town's newest restaurant, Eats & Sweets (1 N. Main St.), which opened last month.\n\nThe annual parade is organized by the nonprofit Smyrna/Clayton July 4th Foundation.\n\n\"We have everyone from the fire companies to the police, plus car clubs and plenty of organizations in town marching,\" says foundation treasurer Joanne Masten. \"Anyone who wants to march just needs to be in the line-up by 1:45 p.m. and you're in the parade.\"\n\nFollowing those early shots of St. Pat's fun, the next stop on our family fun tour brings us to The Grand on Friday, March 16, for a concert by Scottish bagpipe/rock act Red Hot Chili Pipers at 8 p.m. on St. Patrick's Day Eve.\n\nThis genre-bending act first performed at The Grand two years ago and have been invited back once again for another high-energy show.\n\nThe act was in the news last month when an English man mistakenly bought tickets to see the band in Ireland, thinking they were American rockers and Firefly Music Festival alum Red Hot Chili Peppers. After making the trip Valentine's Day weekend, he and his girlfriend realized their mistake and made headlines.\n\nSo if you want to see *bagpipers* and not Anthony Kiedis and Flea, tickets cost $32-$38 at thegrandwilmington.org, by calling 652-5577 or in person at the box office.\n\nThe morning after will be the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Dover.\n\nDowntown Dover St. Patrick's Day Parade steps off at 11 a.m.\n\nLast year's half-mile march included more than 50 civic groups, clubs, politicians, military organizations, businesses and religious groups in our state's capital.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

He told me that I am the strongest, bravest person he knows, and I should have the chance to ring a bell. So, sitting on my couch, in my pajamas, I rang the bell. As my husband and kids clapped, I cried tears of joy and was and forever will be thankful.’’\n\nWhile Sexton’s story is especially poignant, she is not alone in singling out an ornament off her tree as the most meaningful of all.\n\nMore:Seeking holiday fun? Here's your one-stop spot for Christmas, New Years events in Delaware\n\nAs we anticipate Christmas, we reached out to our readers and asked them to share with us photos of their favorite ornaments, as well as the story behind them that gives them special status on the tree each holiday season.\n\nWe got an overwhelming response to our question, which prompted memories of lost loved ones, joyful milestones, inside jokes, favorite activities, Delaware pride and much more.\n\nWe share many of the stories here, and more in our accompanying gallery of photos at the top of our story.\n\nNothing small about the memories\n\nCarol Giampietro of Ardentown had no trouble selecting her favorite ornament on the tree.\n\n“[This] very old and tiny stocking is my favorite,’’ she said in an email. “It’s a reminder that not everything in life needs to be grandiose to have value.’’\n\nThat sentiment is echoed by Tish and Fred Gallagher of historic New Castle.\n\n“Our favorite ornament is also the smallest,’’ they explain. “It's a tiny basket carved from a peach pit by Fred's maternal grandfather, Albert R. Kirby. Then he used it as a ‘worry stone’ until it achieved the polished surface it has today.\n\n“We tied a little red ribbon on it years ago and hung it on the tree because we didn't have many tree ornaments. Forty-seven years later, we have lots of ornaments but this little one always has a prime spot on our tree!’’\n\nFrank Borrelli also cherishes a tiny ornament hanging in a place of honor on his tree each year, a handmade drum crafted by his mother 71 years ago.\n\n“The top and bottom of the drum were aluminum milk bottle tops used by Meadow Gold Dairy in Pittsburgh, Pa.,’’ said Borrelli, who now lives in Pittsburgh. The side of the drum is painted by hand in watercolors.\n\n“Although a little crumbled today, it reminds me how my parents being first- and second-generation immigrants of humble beginnings spent days preparing for the celebration of Christmas.’’\n\nAs to the key to Kathy Franklin’s heart, it came with a pair of roller skates.\n\nFranklin, of Wilmington, considers her old skate key a special ornament at Christmas.\n\n“What could be more nostalgic?’’\n\nOldies but goodies\n\nIt’s not surprising that the most precious decorations have seen many, many Christmases.\n\nMargie Webb of Wilmington takes special care with a glass Santa perched on a crescent moon.\n\n“My favorite ornament belonged to my Great Aunt Catherine, who if she were living, would be 111,’’ she explained. “So, imagine the Santa on the crescent moon must be about 150 years old. Blown glass and so fragile. I remember looking at it hanging on her tree when they lived in Hockessin.’’\n\nKay Wells looks forward to hanging a glass ornament from 1948 on her tree each year.\n\n“My mother bought it for me when I was 11 years old. ... It survived four sons and still looks good!’’ the Wilmington resident joked.\n\nBarbara White of Newark has a lifetime of Christmas memories to share, and cherished ornaments to go with them.\n\nThe fragile, glass bell and other ornaments are not something she takes for granted.\n\n“I'm 90 now, and these ornaments were first used Christmas 1932 when I was 9 months old. It was during the height of the Great Depression and I'm surprised that my parents could even afford them. My dad worked in a bakery in Dover … at $16 per week for as many hours as the boss wanted you to work. There was a line of men at the door to take your job if you complained,” she confided.\n\n“There was a fire in my parents’ house in 1965 and the rest of my childhood ornaments were lost,” she recalled. “Fortunately, I had taken these when I was married in 1952 and they have been on my Christmas tree ever since so they're part of my family's Christmas memories, too.”\n\nNow she shares them with her three grandsons and four great-grandchildren.\n\nAll creatures great and small\n\nReindeer are a popular addition to Christmas trees, and Jimmy McKay of New Castle has a special one.\n\nFashioned from peanut shells, “This Nutty Christmas Reindeer was handmade by my grandmother and her friends who sold their ceramics and crafts at craft shows/bazaars. It is from the mid-1980s, and is a reminder of the fun times I had with my grandmother and her friends helping them create and sell their crafts.”\n\nBut Rudolph and friends aren’t the only critters to make it onto Douglas firs and blue spruce branches.\n\nFor Michael Snyder of Wilmington, it’s all about the bears.\n\n“My husband and I collect bears for our special Christmas ornaments,” he shared. “Each year since we started dating, we will pick a new one for the year or if we see one that we especially love during the rest of the year, we will get it. My goal would be to have our own ‘Bear Tree!’”\n\nStill with us at Christmas\n\nChristmas is a time for being with those we love and remembering those no longer joining us around the tree.\n\nFor Stacy Roberts of New Castle, that means unwrapping and finding hooks for ornaments decorated with pictures of Roberts' parents, who died recently. They were a gift from Roberts' wife.\n\nRoberts also holds dear ornaments from a Cape Cod whale-watching trip and from their honeymoon in Amsterdam.\n\nDonald Bischoff owns the Crimson Moon Tavern in Wilmington.\n\nHis favorite ornament is a pair of sparkly angel wings given to him in memory of Robert Ellis, “a dear friend to many at the Crimson Moon and throughout Wilmington who died unexpectedly a couple of years ago.”\n\nReflecting the lights off Karen Hudson’s tree is a gold carousel horse given to her by her sister the first Christmas after losing their father.\n\n“As a child, he would visit family in Ocean City, Maryland, just blocks from Trimper’s Amusement Rides that included a 1912 Grand Carousel full of beautiful wooden animals. Years later, he would become postmaster at Ocean City. And in October 1988 the USPS issued a 25-cent commemorative stamp featuring carousel animals. The last picture we have of Dad is from the stamp’s first day of issue celebration and he is standing next to that beautiful Grand Carousel.”\n\nThe festive – and the unexpected\n\nMike Leister is pretty certain he has an ornament on his tree unique in all of Delaware.\n\n“Who would imagine that the CIA would have a gift store at Langley Headquarters? Who would believe they have a wonderful museum that almost no one can visit?” asks the Magnolia resident.\n\n“I was fortunate to visit both some years ago when I was asked to give some guidance on how to preserve an aircraft in their collection. I used to work at the AMC Museum at Dover AFB. They invited me over to examine their spy plane, and afterwards visit their in-house museum. Before we left, we got to visit their gift store and it had some pretty fine swag including this ornament.”\n\nRick Berl of Lewes and his wife like to accumulate unusual ornaments.\n\n“We have birds from Caribbean islands, a Bigfoot from out west, a Cal Ripken statuette, and since we have children, naturally a large assortment of Disney-related characters,” Berl said. “But the one I like the most is a hand-painted eggshell with scenes of coastal Delaware, where we have resided for the last 40 years.”\n\nTheir favorite is an egg adorned on one side with the Cape Henlopen Lighthouse, on the other the iconic Dolle’s in Rehoboth Beach.\n\n“I can't remember where we bought it or when (although we have had it at least 20 years). As you might expect, it is extremely fragile and I am a little surprised it has lasted this long. But, as long as we continue to decorate trees, and until it falls one night and breaks, it will appear prominently.”\n\nLynne Sklar of Rehoboth doesn’t celebrate Christmas, but she has a cherished ornament nonetheless.\n\n“Our family is Jewish and celebrates Hanukkah but it is very difficult to find beautiful, quality decorations, especially years ago!” she said. “In 1997, a non-Jewish friend of mine gave me this beautiful, glass dreidel ornament as a gift, made by European designer Christopher Radko. This began my 25-year collection of Radko dreidels, all different and each a work of art. I currently have 13 that I proudly display each December but the first one, named Simon’s Dreidel, will always be my favorite!”\n\nMade with love\n\nJohn Schuyler of Wilmington made his family’s favorite ornament with his own two hands sometime around 1968.\n\nThe hand-carved ornament is made of black walnut and spells out “Tradition.”\n\n“Having been made from a scrap of wood, it has no real monetary value but a great deal of sentimental family value. The tree isn’t considered decorated until this last ornament is placed on the tree. Though our tree has become smaller as we age, it is still the centerpiece of our tree …\n\n“Not everything needs to be valued in dollars to be appreciated!”\n\nNancy Proud Freebery of Claymont can’t talk about the holidays without thinking of her dad.\n\n“Charlie Proud was an awesome dad. Father of four, he was not a decorator … he left that to our very capable mom, Jane,” Freebery explained.\n\nWhich is why her favorite ornament, which will turn 65 next month, means all the more to her.\n\n“Back then, you did not order personalized ‘Baby’s First Christmas’ ornaments online. So, with each new child, he selected an ornament just for us and printed, by hand, our name and birth year, and placed it on the back of the ornament. The kicker – he printed it on medical adhesive tape! And it lasted!\n\n“I am the baby and my Santa is the only ornament ‘left hanging’ of the four! Although our parents are no longer with us, all of my siblings are, and we remember our ornaments with such joy. Dad’s favorite line was “Be of Good Cheer” – and not just at Christmas. And boy was he! Merry Christmas!”\n\nMore holiday stories\n\nNeed a feast?These Delaware restaurants are cooking up something good for you this Christmas\n\nNo shame in asking:Where to get a free holiday meal, groceries this month\n\nShare the blessings:Where to find free gifts or give donations during this holiday season", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}]}

Sitting next to Calagione, Dick silently nods yes, yes, yes when Calagione is asked if the Beard Award has changed anything.\n\nCalagione seems surprised. \"Really?\" he says, as the chef continues to nod.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nDick says he believes customers, especially foodies, coming to the new location are going to expect more now than ever before from the Dogfish Head Craft Brewery founder and president and his staff and are interested in what's coming next.\n\n\"Just look at the fingerprints on the window,\" he jokes, pointing to the glass in the booth, purposely shaped like beer bubble, where for months the curious have been peering inside from the sidewalk of the town's main thoroughfare.\n\nIndeed, it could be a whole new playing field for Dogfish Head as it gets ready to unveil a 6,300-square-foot, modern, hard-to-miss two-story building erected in a former parking lot next to the old brewpub that's been several years in the making. Calagione this week gave The News Journal an exclusive look at the new, 180-seat brewpub.\n\nCalagione, a beer drinker with champagne tastes, confirms the price tag for the project is a cool – and pricey – $4 million.\n\n\"If I worked for a corporation, I'd get fired for spending that much on a brewpub,\" Calagione says, standing in the spacious, gleaming kitchen, which includes a pasta machine imported from Italy, a custom open-flame pizza oven and a wood grill that will be fed a continuous diet of oak and hickory logs that are stacked in the main dining room.\n\nLive, original music is so important to Calagione, especially when eating and drinking, \"we built our whole facility around it.\" The main focus in the new building is its elevated, 220-square-foot stage, equipped with a premium sound and lighting system and professional soundboard that was created for showcasing local and national bands. Acts already booked include Richard Lloyd, formerly of the punk band Television, and Marshall Crenshaw.\n\n\"It cost more than our entire original brewing system,\" says Calagione, proudly pointing to the soundboard on the second floor that will have another, smaller bar. Those who desire a quieter, more intimate spot can request one of the barrel-shaped booths. But, take note, it's first-come, first-serve, and Dogfish Head plans to continue its no-reservations policy.\n\nDogfish Head's signature style for 22 years has been always been go big and bold or go home. Calagione, a pioneer of beers with take-no-prisoners flavors and culinary ingredients, has dared to put scrapple in beer as well as other offbeat ingredients like chocolate, lobster and raisins. His \"off-centered\" efforts have been highly praised and rewarded.\n\nDogfish Brewings & Eats is already a popular destination restaurant. Dick says they can serve close to 1,000 customers a day. Yet, while the Dogfish beer selections there have often been labeled as excellent, the satisfying but not-so-memorable food served at the old brewpub hasn't always seemed to match the quality of the beverages.\n\nThat is changing, Calagione says.\n\n\"We never had such an intentional culinary program,\" he says, adding there is now a full-time person in charge of sourcing the best – and most regional – ingredients for chefs at both Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats and Chesapeake & Maine, its next-door seafood eatery that also was recognized this year by the James Beard Foundation as having one of the best bar programs in the country.\n\nDogfish Fish now is so laser-focused on its own products, it no longer does food collaborations, such as a line of sausages, hop-infused pickles and canned clam chowder that were offered for sale at its Milton brewery, online, in some stores and at the Rehoboth brewpub.\n\nBrewpub Chef Zach Dick, a veteran of restaurants in New York and Florida, is more than ready to produce award-winning caliber food at the new location. He has pored over the new menu, tweaking some items, such as crab corn chowder and the Indulgence burger, a crowd favorite, and is completely overhauling dishes like the Dogpile. Previously an artichoke-spinach dip and melted mozzarella, it now will be a Dogfish Head take on nachos.\n\nDick says the homemade pizza dough has changed. While attending culinary school at Johnson & Wales University, Dick studied with baking expert/cookbook author Peter Reinhart, also a James Beard winner, and has picked up many tips for creating a thin, crisp \"neo-Neapolitan\" crust. The pizza, baked in an oven heated to 720 degrees for just over 2 minutes, will be served browned, blistered and topped with house-made ricotta and mozzarella cheeses.\n\nDick has also previously worked with New York chef/restaurateur and James Beard winner David Bouley, known for his high standards, and at The Breakers, a highly rated hotel in Palm Beach, Florida. He plans on baking pretzels in-house and is excited about a giant \"Man's Man\" Wood-Grilled Cheese Sandwich that's stuffed with gooey cheddar, gouda and provolone cheeses and served with dark, rich Palo Santo Marron infused onion jam.\n\n\"We're going to push the envelope on the food,\" Dick says.\n\nCarrie Leishman, president and chief executive officer of the Delaware Restaurant Association, says she thinks customers are looking forward to seeing the same \"Maverick-style\" that Calagione has brought to his beer, now be reflected in his food. She says Calagione has already shown his forward-thinking approach at Chesapeake & Maine.\n\n\"People want to see what made him a rock star and his unique style and funkiness,\" Leishman says. \"This is the perfect opportunity for him to show people his personality and show that his dedication to beer will be consistent with his dedication to food. I know I can't wait to see it.\"\n\nAt the new Dogfish, Calagione has created his own personal \"man cave,\" so to speak, celebrating some of his favorite things – beer, punk rock and hip-hop music, along with casual, wood-grilled food.\n\nThe building actually is anything but a cave. The bright, airy and contemporary design from DIGSAU Architects, a Philadelphia-based firm that also designed Dogfish Head's brewery in Milton, features a soaring, exposed ceiling; full-length windows; and warm wooden walls. Two metal staircases lead to a mezzanine dining area that overlooks the main room and stage. Pendant lighting hangs over some of the booths. Photos of punk rock stars such as The Ramones and Patti Smith share wall space with artwork of Sonic Youth and Run-D.M.C.\n\nThe main dining room has special \"off-centered\" quirks, such as the barrel-shaped booths and a nook by the bar. It is pretty much everything that the cramped and dark former crabhouse was not.\n\nThe old building will remain open all summer for visitors to purchase Dogfish Head merchandise and to fill crowlers and growlers to-go. It will then be razed, and an open courtyard will be created in its place, connecting Dogfish Head and Chesapeake & Maine.\n\nCalagione feels no real sense of nostalgia, no sadness in letting go of the old brewpub.\n\n\"It was not bittersweet; it was sweet,\" he says of the May 7 closing. He was more than ready to say goodbye to the aging building with its sometimes faulty HVAC system and a kitchen that could reach 125 degrees in the summer.\n\n\"The old Brewings & Eats was not world-class. Not one person has said, 'I'm really bummed to see that new space,'\" he says.\n\nHowever, at the May 7 closing, some patrons, perhaps wanting a piece of history, did try to take home bar stool \"souvenirs.\" One even pulled out a screwdriver to score Dogfish memorabilia from the walls. Calagione says staffers had to politely remind the customer that taking something that didn't belong to him is, ahem, stealing, and to please put the tool away.\n\nFor several years, the Calagiones have wanted to create a better atmosphere for customers and improve the aging restaurant's look with a new structure. It turned out to be a much more rocky road than the owners imagined.\n\nDuring an April 2015 city Board of Adjustment meeting, the Calagiones asked for permission to expand and create a modern building, but they were turned down. What was even more startling was when one board member suggested they move the business out of downtown Rehoboth.\n\nThe comment sparked anger among the business community. Dogfish Head has been credited with helping with tourism in Delaware's busiest resort, especially during slower winter months. In 2015, nearly 8 million visitors came to the Coastal Highway, downtown Rehoboth and the Dewey Beach area, according to the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Calagiones eventually received city approval to tear down the brewpub. The new eatery will likely be the last restaurant of its scale in Rehoboth. In November, Rehoboth Beach commissioners voted on restaurant size limits. Eateries that serve alcohol within the city will now be allowed 2,500 square feet of seated dining area and 500 square feet of bar area.\n\nCalagione has long been ready to move on from the initial reluctance for the new brewpub and is looking toward the future. His focus is on collaboration and not competition. The new brewpub, open daily, year-round, will include in-house experimental brews that can't be found anywhere but Rehoboth.\n\nWhen beer lovers rest elbows on the horseshoe-style, walnut-top bar, they can enjoy 24 taps pouring fan-favorite Dogfish Head beers, but they'll also get beverages made in collaboration with other breweries.\n\nThe first brewpub exclusive collaboration at the new site is expected to make a splash – Bloody Beer. Earlier this week, Calagione and Joe Short, owner of Short's Brewing Co., a 13-year-old facility created out of a former hardware store in Bellaire, Michigan, spent the day making Short's Bloody Mary-inspired beer. They filmed their adventures – an homage to the 2001 movie \"Wet Hot American Summer\" – for the Dogfish Head website and social media sites.\n\nTo make Bloody Beer, the brewers used about 128 pounds of blanched, pureed Roma tomatoes, along with a blend of horseradish, dill, celery seed and black pepper, to create the imperial style brew.\n\nCalagione joked that because of all the crushed tomatoes, the brewhouse looked \"like a horror movie scene.\"\n\nThe recipe, which takes about three weeks to complete, produces a golden-hued, slightly spicy, low-hopped beer with about 7 percent alcohol. Eight kegs of Short's Brewing Bloody Beer should be available at the new brewpub in early June, and about 100 limited-edition canned 32-ounce crowlers will be on sale.\n\n\"It's Joe's recipe and we like bringing recognition to him,\" says Calagione, who can't wait to try the beer that won a 2009 Great American Beer Festival silver medal. But he says it won't become part of Dogfish's catalog.\n\n\"You won't see Dogfish do a Bloody Beer,\" Calagione says. \"So, you better come and get it when it's here. If not, you'll need to go to Michigan.\"\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861 or ptalorico@delawareonline.com and on Twitter @pattytalorico\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWHAT: The new Dogfish Head Brewings & Eats restaurant.

Shouting broke out among senators when the exemption was removed without a roll call vote. Democrats and some Republicans objected to the change to the bill, which would make performing an abortion at any stage of pregnancy a felony, being gaveled through quickly. Senate President Pro Tem Del Marsh suggested lawmakers go home for the weekend to cool off and resume debate Tuesday. Marsh said he supports an exemption for rape and wants a roll call vote on the matter next week. The anger underscored tensions over the proposal that would become the most stringent abortion restriction in the country if approved.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Eight conservation groups sued Tuesday to stop the largest sale of Alaska old growth timber in decades, claiming the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental policy and its own management plan for the Tongass National Forest with the sale. The agency’s plan is to harvest as much as 225 million board feet of old growth timber from Prince of Wales Island. The Forest Service didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sharon Gleason, who has dealt two setbacks to the Trump administration this year. She found that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when reversing bans on offshore drilling and that the administration violated federal law with a proposed road that would split a wilderness area in a national wildlife refuge.\n\nArizona\n\nMarble Canyon: One of the most exclusive and dramatic hiking spots in the Southwest could see bigger crowds under a new proposal unveiled Wednesday. The Bureau of Land Management is weighing increasing its daily visitor limits from 20 to 96 people a day at The Wave, a popular rock formation near the Arizona-Utah border. A 6-mile round-trip hike through tall sandstone buttes and sage brush is required to get to the Wave, a wide, sloping basin of searing reds, oranges and yellows in the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument. The agency is asking for public comment, and changes could be implemented as soon as October, agency official Mike Herder says. Visitors compete for permits in a monthly online lottery and at daily walk-in drawings. Less than 5% of the 150,000 people who wanted to hike the trail last year were actually able to do it, according to federal data.\n\nArkansas\n\nBatesville: A juvenile detention facility synonymous with neglect and abuse is to be shuttered and the building transformed into a treatment center for sex trafficking survivors, officials say. White River Regional Juvenile Detention Center will close by this summer, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Jonathan Pickering, facility director, says the new center will provide youths who were forced into the sex trade with at least three individual and three group therapy sessions a week. Pickering says families can join the sessions too, and staff will arrange transportation if necessary. The facility has a storied history. In April, a former White River jailer was sentenced to seven years in prison for what a judge called “sadistic and completely unjustified” punishments for disorderly juveniles. Another was imprisoned in March for violating youths’ rights and falsifying documents.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The San Diego Zoo has two new arrivals: a pair of endangered African penguin chicks. The zoo announced Wednesday that the fluffy chicks – named Doug and Barbara in honor of Douglas G. Myers, president and CEO of San Diego Zoo Global, and his wife, Barbara Myers – hatched two months ago. The eggs came from two breeding couples. The zoo says it’s the first time eggs laid by its adult penguins have hatched there. Staffers have been working with the chicks to get them used to humans before they are introduced into the penguin colony in the next few weeks. African penguins are an endangered species. Their numbers have dropped by more than 60% in the past three decades, and only 23,000 breeding pairs are known to exist. The decline is blamed on several factors, including disease, habitat destruction, and lack of food from overfishing, climate change and pollution.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The end-of-semester Undie Run at Colorado State University started innocently enough, with a few hundred participants in their skivvies and a handful of clothes-filled trash bags carted off to Goodwill, according to its first student organizer. But more than a decade later, CSU is putting its foot down, taking its hardest stance yet against an event it now says is characterized by public intoxication and rampant sexual misconduct. Its message – in a letter distributed to students, emailed to parents and printed in multiple full-page ads in the campus newspaper – is clear: “The university will not allow the ‘undie run’ to take place this year.” The run, which has never been sanctioned or supported by CSU, has sprung up every spring since 2008 thanks to Facebook groups led by largely unnamed organizers and campus word-of-mouth. It’s typically held on the last day of classes before finals week, which for this semester is Friday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s Democratic-controlled House of Representatives has voted to incrementally increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2023, following a marathon, overnight debate. Weary lawmakers advanced the bill to the Senate, 85-59, with one Democrat joining Republicans in opposition, shortly after noon Thursday. The occasionally contentious debate, which began about 10 p.m. Wednesday, was wrapped by New Haven Rep. Robyn Porter, the Democratic House chairwoman of the General Assembly’s Labor Committee. Referencing her own early struggles as a divorced mother of two, Porter said the wage increase will help those who “don’t have two nickels to rub together” and feel like $10 is $100. But Republicans warned the wage increase will harm an already fragile state economy and lead to job reductions and more automation.\n\nDelaware\n\nMilford: Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, one of the state’s best-known businesses, announced Thursday that it is merging with Boston Beer Co., the makers of Sam Adams beer and Angry Orchard hard cider. The merger, valued at about $300 million, is expected to close late in the second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions. It’s a stunning turn of events for the Milford-based, independent brewery founded by Sam Calagione, a Massachusetts native, and his wife Mariah, who was born in Delaware. Dogfish Head plans to retain its name and will still be a craft brewery, according to a press release sent out Thursday. The brewery began in Rehoboth Beach in 1995 as a “nanobrewery.” As the company grew, brewing moved to its current Milton site. The brewery and the tasting room have since become one of Delaware’s top tourist destinations.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The chair of the City Council has proposed an amendment to the city’s 2020 budget that would severely limit access to public records. The Washington Post reports the legislation would allow the city to reject record requests that don’t include specifications about the sought documents, including the subject matter, names of senders and recipients, and a date range. It would only permit the disclosure of information “regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of public officials and employees.” Chairman Phil Mendelson says the Freedom of Information Act “wasn’t intended for fishing expeditions.” His proposal comes after the newspaper requested email records through FOIA and found that Councilman Jack Evans used his government email to pitch himself to area lobbyists.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The wacky, weird and wild world of Florida Man is getting its own show. Oxygen Media, which in 2017 announced a full-time shift to true-crime-related television, revealed Tuesday that a series based on “America’s most notorious, outrageous, craftiest killers from the Sunshine State” has been added to its projects. There is no premiere date for the show. The series will be developed by Blumhouse Productions and Man vs. Robot. Blumhouse, founded by Jason Blum, an Academy Award nominee and Emmy winner, is known for producing low-budget horror films “Get Out,” “The Purge” and “Insidious.” With the working title of “Florida Man,” the series will “unravel the strange twists and turns and try in vain to reason how and why this breed of killers took their crimes to levels beyond comprehension,” Oxygen officials said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s law enforcement will have to preserve rape kits for much longer than what was previously required under a bill signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp this week. Democratic Rep. Scott Holcomb, the bill’s main supporter, says the DNA evidence in the rape kits will help solve cold cases and pursue justice for survivors of sexual violence. Previously, Georgia only required rape kits to be stored for 10 years. The new law requires the state to preserve the evidence 30 years after the arrest date or seven years from the completion of a prison sentence, whichever occurs later. If there are no arrests, the kit must be stored for 50 years. Holcomb also authored a 2016 law that helped cut down on the state’s backlog of rape kits.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Federal officials are asking the public to give adequate space to a monk seal that has been resting on a Waikiki beach. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that the female seal identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi has come onto the beach in Honolulu four times in recent days. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species protected by state and federal laws that typically forages at night and “hauls up” to rest on beaches during the day. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials ask members of the public in the high-traffic area to remain behind barriers set up to protect the seal. Officials say Kaiwi has previously given birth to pups in south and east Oahu. Although she does not appear pregnant at this time, it is possible.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State agencies are racing to beat a Friday deadline to keep alive thousands of administrative rules after the Legislature’s House of Representatives in April killed a bill reauthorizing them. Republican Gov. Brad Little directed state agencies to submit temporary and pending rules by Friday to be vetted before publication in a special Idaho Administrative Bulletin on June 19. A 21-day public comment period follows before the rules can attain temporary status by July 1 and remain in effect. Many state agencies have started the process, and on Wednesday the Idaho Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in a special meeting voted 4-0 to authorize the Idaho Department of Lands to initiate temporary rulemaking on the agency’s oil and gas regulations.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Plans are in the works to open a visitors’ center for the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Laurent House, which opened as a museum four years ago. The Rockford Register Star reports the Laurent House Foundation plans to renovate dilapidated properties across the street from the home. It will offer a visitors’ center and gift shop and have offices and parking. Private donations are funding the $500,000 project. An estimated 2,000 people toured the home last year, and it has attracted visitors from Australia, Japan and the United Kingdom. The 2,600-square-foot Laurent House, built in the early 1950s, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It’s the only house Wright designed specifically for someone with disabilities. The foundation won approval Monday from the Rockford City Council to annex the properties.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Sports betting will become legal and construction of two new casinos will be allowed in the state under a bill signed by the governor Wednesday. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb endorsed the bill on his final day to act on the measure approved by lawmakers after they reached a deal in the final hours of this year’s legislative session. So far this year, Indiana joins Montana and Tennessee in moving to legalize sports wagering after six other states moved quickly following a U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing it nationwide last year. Indiana sports wagering could start in September. Bets could be placed by anyone 21 or older at a casino or by mobile devices after a bettor has registered with an Indiana casino. Holcomb says the state’s casino industry has faced greater competition as neighboring states have legalized more forms of gambling.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: In an effort to help the environment without skimping on photographic fun, the University of Iowa Pentacrest Museums, made up of the Old Capitol Museum and the Museum of Natural History, have made an enticing offer for graduates. Confetti has always been a part of graduations, but the museum group wants it to become a thing of the past, posting on its Facebook page that it’s ready to digitally alter graduation photos to add confetti. The post asked students to consider that “many kinds of confetti are not biodegradable and are a health risk to our wildlife.” Interested students can message the Facebook page directly or email jessica-smith-7@uiowa.edu to send their photos to a museum designer.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A new government report says the state’s winter wheat crop is maturing more slowly than usual. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported this week that about 14% of the wheat has now headed. That is near what it was a year ago but well behind the 41% average for the date. The agency also rated wheat condition as 10% poor to very poor, 32% in fair shape, and 58% in good to excellent condition. Growers have also seeded about 41% of their corn acreage, behind the 51% that is normally in the ground by this time. Planting of soybean and sorghum crops in Kansas is just getting underway, with progress at or near the average.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s re-election campaign is capitalizing on a fellow Republican’s attack, selling “Cocaine Mitch” shirts on his campaign’s website. The shirts appear to have been hot sellers. The Kentucky Republican’s campaign Twitter account said Wednesday that McConnell was closing in on one of his biggest fundraising days of the year and thanked people who chipped in by purchasing shirts. The shirt shows a faceless figure with a sprinkling of cocaine on the side. It says “Mitch” on the front and “cartel member” on the back. The Senate leader’s campaign is laughing off an attack by ex-coal executive and failed Senate candidate Don Blankenship, who called him “Cocaine Mitch” after a magazine article alleged drugs were found aboard a cargo ship owned by the family of McConnell’s wife, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A proposal to exempt diapers and tampons from the state sales tax stalled Wednesday in the Senate, only to be revived later in a different form and successfully sent to the House for debate. Sen. J.P. Morrell, a New Orleans Democrat, proposed a constitutional change to remove the 4.45% state sales tax from diapers and feminine hygiene products starting in 2021. Senators refused to include that exemption in the state constitution. The Senate voted 21-12 for the measure, but it needed 26 votes to pass because constitutional amendments require a two-thirds vote. But later in the day, after stymieing the constitutional change, senators agreed to include the tax break in statute. That law change passed in a 29-5 vote, moving to the House for consideration. Morrell said the items are essential to women and children, in line with prescription drugs, which are exempt from sales tax.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The governor is bringing back the state’s Children’s Cabinet in hopes of reducing youth drop-out, recidivism and incarceration rates. Gov. Janet Mills says in a Thursday announcement that she wants to focus on helping Maine children succeed in school, enter the workforce and live healthy lives. The governor says 37 towns of the top 50 with the highest poverty rates in New England in 2010 were located in Maine. She says 1 in 6 Maine children is living in poverty. The Children’s Cabinet dates back to 1996 and last met in 2010. The cabinet has urged Maine to expand quality and accessible early child care and education. Mills also wants to address the number of children suffering substantiated child abuse, which is up 25% from 2017 to 2018.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Some Marylanders are at risk of having their driver’s licenses or identification cards recalled next month if they don’t soon satisfy document requirements that are part of the federally mandated Real ID process, according to a state agency. Some residents who have the new Real ID card still must bring in certain documentation to comply with the federal REAL ID requirement, according to a Thursday news release from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration. The overall deadline for obtaining a Real ID is Oct. 1, 2020, but more than 66,300 people with a new Real ID star license or identification card have not yet filed the required documents, the release says. Without action, MVA says, administrators will start flagging the affected driver’s licenses and identification cards in June as “recalled,” which would result in confiscation if drivers get pulled over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDartmouth: The federal government says a program that sells scallops to pay for marine science will include a study of how shellfish harvesting affects sea turtles in this year’s projects. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the Atlantic Sea Scallop Research Set-Aside will help pay for 13 projects in 2019 and 2020. Regulators use the program to set aside more than a million pounds of scallops, generating millions of dollars for the science projects. Fishermen and scientists collaborate on the program. This year’s awards include a pair to the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth to use underwater cameras to get a better handle on East Coast scallop population health. The award to study sea turtles is slated to go to the Coonamessett Farm Foundation and Roger Williams University.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: There’s one more sign a riverfront concert venue has been renamed after Aretha Franklin. Workers on Thursday were taking down the Chene Park sign outside the venue and putting up one reflecting the name change. It features a stylized signature of the Queen of Soul’s first name. Mayor Mike Duggan told mourners at Franklin’s funeral in August that the name would be changed to Aretha Franklin Amphitheatre, saying that “when Aretha Franklin sang, it sounded like the voice of Detroit.” Days later, City Council unanimously approved it. The facility is known for its outdoor stage and summer concerts, and it hosted a Franklin tribute show last summer. She performed at Chene Park in 2015 to celebrate its 30th anniversary. The 2019 season starts in June. Franklin died Aug. 16 at 76.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Lawmakers are trying to get their hands around skyrocketing drug costs and the pharmaceutical industry that sets the prices. Bills are moving to tackle the problem, from anti-price gouging efforts to new reporting requirements for drug companies when prices spike. Minnesota Public Radio reports that nearly all those bills have been tucked into House and Senate budget bills and are heading into final negotiations. The bipartisan push has been fueled by personal stories. Nicole Smith-Holt has been a regular around the Capitol, talking about her son Alec Smith, a diabetic who died at age 26 because he was rationing insulin that he couldn’t afford. Both the House and Senate health and human services budgets include assistance for emergency insulin supplies, but their different approaches need to be reconciled.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: A police officer helped a driver out of a wrecked sports car and told the man he was “lucky to be alive.” Less than an hour later, the officer was killed by another person who walked up and shot him outside the police station. Biloxi police records show Patrolman Robert McKeithen responded to a crash Sunday night and then returned to the station because he had gotten a flat tire. The driver, Damon Corrigan, 22, told the Sun Herald that McKeithen also accompanied him to a hospital. He says he was shocked to learn the officer had been killed. “The only thing I remember him telling me was that I was so lucky to be alive,” Corrigan told the newspaper. “He was so nice. I felt so bad.” McKeithen, 57, had worked for Biloxi Police Department for almost 24 years.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republicans in the state House are backing away from a budget compromise that would allow colleges and universities to charge in-state tuition to students living in the country illegally. The GOP-led House on Thursday voted 110-43 against the deal. That means a panel of lawmakers will get another shot to negotiate on the policy and the proposed state budget for public colleges and universities. Missouri schools currently face losing state funding if they offer those students anything less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Bipartisan Senate and House negotiators earlier this week agreed to end that policy. But opposition from House Republicans could unravel the deal. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to pass the budget.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock has signed a bill to continue the state’s Medicaid expansion program for another six years, as long as federal funding continues. He was joined at Thursday’s signing ceremony by bill sponsor Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey and Democratic Rep. Mary Caferro, who sponsored a separate bill that did not pass. The program provides health insurance to about 95,000 low-income adults. Buttrey’s bill adds work requirements, strengthens an asset test and increases premiums for people who stay on the program for more than two years. Bullock on Thursday also vetoed a bill that sought to give regulatory backing to insurance companies so they could negotiate better contracts with pharmacy benefit managers for policies sold through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Bullock argued the legislation could lead to higher costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A judge is considering his verdict in a lawsuit that says six convenience stores along Interstate 80 in the state posted misleading signs about prices. A nonjury trial was held last in week in Lincoln in a February 2017 lawsuit filed by several individuals and the Coalition for Ethical Petroleum Marketing. It accuses North Platte-based Wilkinson Development of violating the Nebraska Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act. Wilkinson is accused of advertising low prices to attract travelers to its Fat Dog stores but then selling gas at those prices only at a limited number of pumps, intentionally hoping travelers accidentally filled up with more expensive fuel. The company president has denied the accusation.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An unusually wet stretch of showers and thunderstorms may help Sin City surpass its yearly average for rainfall this week. And it’s not even monsoon season yet. Since January, the National Weather Service has logged 3.8 inches of rainfall in Las Vegas – a few thimbles away from the yearly average of 4.19 inches. “Getting over (4.19 inches) isn’t impossible,” says meteorologist Kate Guillet. “We’re just going to have to wait and see.” The National Weather Service estimates a quarter to a half an inch of rain could fall on the Las Vegas Valley between Thursday and Sunday – and higher amounts are possible.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: As some states and communities have slowly begun to acknowledge their often purposeful erasure of Native Americans from the dominant narrative, the voices, cultures and histories of the Abenaki and Wabanaki peoples were recently given a rightful home in the oldest “neighborhood” settled by Europeans in what’s now the state of New Hampshire. “People of the Dawnland,” an exhibit at the Jones House Family Discover Center in the 1600s Puddle Dock neighborhood, opens this month. The neighborhood, now known as the outdoor Strawbery Banke Museum, did in fact have remnants of indigenous people, such as pottery, projectile points and tent holes, discovered by archaeologists, but the museum has previously largely focused its efforts on the colonial aspects of the early settlement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The state’s beaches, casinos, forests and cities attracted tourists who spent nearly $45 billion last year. Gov. Phil Murphy says tourism spending in New Jersey has increased for nine years in a row. Speaking at a tourism conference Thursday in Trenton, Murphy said the tourism industry generated $5 billion in state and local taxes in 2018. He said about 111 million people visited the Garden State last year, up more than 7% from the previous year. Tourism is the state’s seventh-largest industry, supporting nearly 334,000 jobs. When indirect jobs, such as those that supply the industry, are included, the figure rises to more than 531,000 jobs. Food and beverages and lodging accounted for the largest share of tourism spending.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: World-premiere operas derived from the gender-bending Broadway hit “M. Butterfly” and from meditations on Victorian-era repression in Bram Stroker’s “Dracula” are coming to the Santa Fe Opera and its open-air stage in the high desert. Opera General Director Robert Meya on Wednesday announced upcoming productions for 2020 that include retooled staples such as “Il Barbiere di Siviglia” (“The Barber of Seville”) and the revival of Tim Albery’s version of Mozart’s “Die Zauberflöte” (“The Magic Flute”). In recent years, Santa Fe has been the backdrop for productions about the dawn of the nuclear age in 1940s New Mexico and a world premiere of a techno-infused opera about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg has been a regular visitor to performances in Santa Fe.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Anna Sorokin, the German con artist who passed herself off as a wealthy heiress to swindle banks, hotels and friends, was sentenced Thursday to four to 12 years behind bars. New York Judge Diane Kiesel said at the sentencing hearing that she was “stunned by the depth of the defendant’s deception” and turned down a request by Sorokin’s lawyers that she be sentenced to time she has already spent in jail awaiting trial. Sorkin, 28, was convicted last month on multiple counts of grand larceny and theft of services and has been in custody since her October 2017 arrest. Sorokin went by Anna Delvey when she defrauded financial institutions and Manhattan celebrity circles into believing she had a fortune of about $67 million overseas that could cover her jet-setting lifestyle, high-end clothing and lavish hotel stays.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMurphy: The U.S. Forest Service is proposing one of the largest timber sales in the nearly 100-year history of the Nantahala National Forest, and the public comment period ends Friday. The proposal, known as the Buck Project, is drawing concern from conservation groups worried about harmful effects of logging and road building in this “special place” of potential wilderness and old-growth areas. But it is being welcomed by others who say it will improve forest health and wildlife habitat in forest areas long overdue for a trim. The Buck Project, which includes a timber sale as well as forest restoration activities including prescribed burns and stream improvement projects, would take place in a 20,638-acre analysis area in southeastern Clay County, in the Tusquitee Ranger District of Nantahala, the state’s largest and most western forest.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner says lawmakers may be called back into session over legislation that limits the powers of the state auditor. The Legislature passed a measure late in the session that requires the auditor’s office to get lawmakers’ permission to conduct “performance audits.” The amendment was put in the auditor’s budget that passed unanimously in the Senate and by a large margin in the House. Wardner says he didn’t know the amendment had been put in the budget bill and thinks other senators didn’t, either. Wardner says he and House Minority Leader Chet Pollert will meet with Auditor Josh Gallion next week to discuss the issue and how it will affect the agency. Leaders can recall the Legislature if they haven’t used all their allotted days.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Voters in the capital have agreed to let the city take on as much as $1 billion more in debt to pay for renovations to roads and bridges, underground utilities and other infrastructure. Near the top of spending among issues approved Tuesday is a new municipal courthouse, estimated to cost about $130 million. Voters also approved reserving $50 million for affordable housing as Columbus prepares for a regional plan to address what experts say is a 54,000-unit shortage. The Columbus Dispatch reports this is the largest bond package approved since 2008, when voters passed a $1.7 billion debt plan, mostly to pay for water and sewer projects. The projects won’t raise taxes, but the city could raise property taxes if it can’t repay the debt.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A former U.S. soldier from the state who was pardoned this week for his 2009 conviction for killing an Iraqi prisoner says he initially didn’t answer the White House’s phone call to tell him of the pardon. Former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna says he was on the phone with his father, retired FBI agent Scott Behenna, when the call came about 2:30 p.m. Monday as he was driving. He didn’t recognize the number and thought it might be a telemarketer, so he let it go to voicemail. After checking his messages, he returned the call and was told President Donald Trump was granting him a pardon and would call him back. When Behenna’s phone rang again, it was Trump’s office putting the president on the line so he could tell Behenna personally. He was convicted in 2009 of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone in the 2008 killing of Ali Mansur Mohamed, an unarmed Iraqi prisoner.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A bill to allow dentists in the state to administer vaccines to patients has been signed into law. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports Oregon is the first state in the country to allow dentists to administer any vaccine available at a primary care doctor’s office. Most people may not get their measles, polio and tetanus shots from the dentist, but Oregon Health & Science University School of Dentistry Dean Phillip Marucha says they might want vaccines relevant to oral health such as HPV. He says a large percentage of new oral cancer diagnoses are linked to HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that can also cause cervical cancer and genital warts. Marucha said this law allows a dentist to educate patients about the value of the HPV vaccine and then administer it onsite.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The State Board of Education is giving its support to proposals by Gov. Tom Wolf to require students start schooling by age 6 and continue until they’re at least 18. The board voted unanimously Wednesday for the Democratic governor’s proposals that he unveiled in February. The Republican-controlled Legislature still must approve the proposals for them to take effect. The Wolf administration says lowering the mandatory start age from 8 to 6 would affect about 3,300 children. Officials say only one other state allows parents to keep children out of school until age 8, a policy Pennsylvania adopted in the late 19th century. Pennsylvania’s minimum age to drop out of school is currently 17. The administration says nearly 14,000 students drop out without graduating every year in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island has sued the state on behalf of nonfiction writers, saying a sales tax exemption for authors is unconstitutional because it only applies to works of fiction. The federal suit filed Tuesday argues that making a distinction between fiction and nonfiction violates the First Amendment’s guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. A state law enacted in 2013 exempts from the sales tax “original and creative works” sold by writers, composers and artists residing in Rhode Island. The ACLU says the state’s taxation agency has concluded that nonfiction books are not “original and creative works.” A Department of Revenue spokesman said in a statement that the department had not received notice of the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has agreed to provide $120 million in tax breaks to the Carolina Panthers to move their practice fields and team headquarters out of North Carolina. The 27-15 vote Thursday came after contentious debate, with several senators questioning whether public money should be given to a billionaire NFL owner and saying the $3.8 billion proposed economic benefit of the new facility is wildly exaggerated. The bill, enthusiastically backed by Gov. Henry McMaster, would exempt the Panthers from paying state income taxes for players, coaches and other employees for 15 years as long as they use the money to build their new complex near Rock Hill. The team will continue to play games 15 miles north in Charlotte, North Carolina. McMaster is expected to quickly sign the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The latest federal census of agriculture finds the number of farms in the state has dropped. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s 2017 census, South Dakota’s farmland was worked by fewer farming operations from 2012 to 2017. The census is conducted every five years. Statewide, more than 43 million acres were operated as farms. But there were 2,000 fewer farming operations in the state in 2017 than in 2012. The Aberdeen News reports the biggest drop came from farms operating between 10 and 1,000 acres. That number dropped by 1,850 over those five years. Nate Franzen, president of the Ag Banking Division at First Dakota National Bank based in Yankton, cites several reasons why farming operations are going out of business, including retirement, financial struggles and other business opportunities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The National Civil Rights Museum is being honored by a federal agency that supports the nation’s museums. The Institute of Museum and Library Services said in a news release Tuesday that the Memphis-based museum is one of 10 recipients of National Medal for Museum and Library Service. Institute officials say the award honors museums and libraries that make exceptional contributions to their communities. Opened in 1991, the museum is built on the site of the former Lorraine Motel. Civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was fatally shot while standing on the hotel’s balcony April 4, 1968. The museum chronicles the history of the U.S. civil rights movement and holds discussions and events related to civil and human rights issues.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Electricity demand is expected to hit record levels this summer, and with a thin margin of reserve power, the operator of the state’s grid says it may have to ask businesses and consumers to conserve. Officials at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas are not ruling out rolling blackouts, although they say other measures are more likely, including importing power from other grids. ERCOT predicted Wednesday that demand in the state will rise as high as 74,853 megawatts. That’s 1,300 megawatts higher than the record set last July 19. The grid operator predicts demand will grow at an above-normal rate of 2.5% to 3% every year through 2022. Demand is booming partly because of growing West Texas oil and gas operations and industrial development along the Gulf Coast.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A popular three-day music festival featuring the likes of rapper G-Eazy has been canceled after state officials refused to grant a liquor license. The Salt Lake Tribune reports the authorities cited past drug and alcohol-related violations in refusing to grant a permit for the Bonanza Campout, which was canceled Wednesday. The 4-year-old event had been scheduled for June 21-23 near Heber City, about 45 miles east of Salt Lake City. It would have presented 36 artists, including electronic-music producer DJ Snake and Australian pop-rock duo Empire of the Sun. Organizers said in a statement that all ticket and lodging purchases for the event will be refunded and that they plan to have the festival again in 2020.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Lawmakers are considering steps to make it easier for prison inmates to reduce the length of their sentences through good behavior or acts of heroism. The previous “good time” system was repealed in 2005 because it was thought to be too complex. Corrections Commissioner Mike Touchette says Vermont is one of a handful of states that lacks a good time program. Currently only prison work-camp inmates can earn shorter sentences. The Legislature is considering a number of proposals. One would allow inmates and offenders on furlough to earn a five-day sentence reduction for every month without a major discipline violation. Touchette says providing incentives for good behavior and rewarding that good behavior is “much more effective” than pure punishment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam has proclaimed May “Second Chance Month” in a bid to focus attention on criminal justice reform and inmate re-entry programs. Northam said in a statement Wednesday that redemption is a “fundamental American value” and that his administration is committed to making sure that former inmates have the support they need to succeed. The governor’s proclamation comes a few months after he asked Virginians for a second chance following a blackface scandal that almost forced him from office. Northam has since prioritized efforts to address long-standing racial inequities, particularly those related to the criminal justice system. The Democratic governor was recently able to overcome strong opposition from key GOP lawmakers and eliminate the suspension of driver’s licenses for motorists with unpaid court fines and costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A state official says wolves should be removed from the federal endangered species list in the entirety of the state. Washington Fish and Wildlife Director Kelly Susewind in April wrote a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in support of the proposal to delist wolves in the Lower 48 states. Susewind calls the proposal “appropriate and timely” as wolves are recovering. Wolves in the eastern third of Washington are already delisted. The Center for Biological Diversity criticized the letter, saying the idea of stripping federal protections from wolves is “appalling.” The environmental group contends 72% of Washington residents want federal protection. The federal government has already delisted wolves in the eastern third of Washington and Oregon, as well as in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClay: A new rail trail is set to be built in the state. Gov. Jim Justice announced Wednesday that the state has signed a letter of intent to purchase land for the project. The trail will use 72 miles of existing rail lines in Clay and Kanawha counties, along the Elk River and Buffalo Creek. Justice says the tracks will be converted into trails for walking, hiking, biking or other recreational purposes. He says the project could become the second-longest rail trail east of the Mississippi. Justice says the he hopes portions of the trail will be up and running by summer 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWest Allis:A plate of eggs stole the attention of social media this week when the president’s favorite TV show, “Fox and Friends,” broadcast from a local diner. Johnny V’s says the plate of a whopping 10 sunny side up eggs that appeared in front of a man deriding politicians’ plans for “free this, free that” was actually part of its King of Johnny V’s breakfast special, which also includes eight huge pancakes, a pound of hash browns, three pieces of bacon, three pieces of sausage, a piece of ham and Texas toast. If a single person can finish it in an hour, they get the meal and a T-shirt free. They also get their picture posted on a wall. The staff was hoping the King challenge would get a shout-out from the Fox TV host, but time apparently didn’t allow for it.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: National forest managers in the western part of the state expect to see large numbers of mushroom hunters in the weeks ahead. Forests that have recently burned are prime places to look for tasty morel mushrooms. A large area of Bridger-Teton National Forest that burned in 2018 could be prime hunting grounds. Morels also like wet weather, and the region has received plenty of rain and snow this spring. The Jackson Hole News & Guide reports forest officials have implemented a $300 fee for morel hunters who sell their finds. They will only allow commercial morel hunting in the northern part of the Roosevelt Fire burn area. Recreational morel hunters can hunt anywhere in the forest for free but may not collect more than 3 gallons of morels.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2023/05/25/delaware-beach-guide-a-locals-guide-to-rehoboth-lewes-dewey-more/70153728007/", "title": "Delaware beach guide: A local's guide to Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey ...", "text": "We feel sorry for those in the region who only know the Jersey Shore or Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nSure, they are bigger than the Delaware beaches and have more to do, but they seem a bit, uh, soulless compared with the character found at our summertime playgrounds.\n\nLewes has the feel of a small New England port town with Stephen King writing a novel in a house overlooking the quaint Lewes and Rehoboth Canal.\n\nRehoboth Beach has a mighty melange of families seeking fun, candy, games and rides, along with an established LGBTQ community that helps make it stand out from its competitors with big boardwalks.\n\nUndiscovered gems:The best 'secret' beaches in Delaware: Broadkill, Pickering, Slaughter. Plan your visit.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nJust south, Dewey Beach may still be a run-and-run town for the young (and young at heart) looking to bar-hop, but it's growing into more than that as more families visit and also settle down in what once were group beach houses.\n\nBethany Beach is the opposite of Dewey with a small boardwalk and sleepier feel known as \"The Quiet Resorts\" in tandem with Fenwick Island, the smallest of Delaware's beach towns ― and the closest to the way Delaware's beaches once were before development took over years ago.\n\nWith five coastal Delaware towns to choose from within 25 miles of each other, it can be tricky to figure out what's right for you and your fellow beach-goers.\n\nTo help, the Delaware Online/The News Journal newsroom brainstormed a local's guide to Delaware's beaches to help point the way.\n\nWhether you want to let loose at a beach bar, take a quiet nature walk or escape a rainstorm with the family for some indoor shenanigans, we have plenty of ideas because we've done them all ourselves.\n\nWith the temperatures rising, it's time to grab your bathing suit and soak in some sun.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nIf you're searching for the classic American summer beach experience, Rehoboth and its milelong Boardwalk, which dates back to 1873, is the place for you.\n\nSoaked in nostalgia, it's the land of beach umbrellas, saltwater taffy, and, of course, hungry seagulls looking for a runaway french fry.\n\nIts main drag, Rehoboth Avenue, is packed with non-chain shops and eateries, and you'll find the LGBTQ-heavy Baltimore Avenue just a block away.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nA beach scene. A foodie scene. A gay scene. That's the reason Rehoboth is Delaware's favorite playground for so many.\n\nIt's where President Joe Biden has his summer beach house in North Shores, sometimes seen riding bikes on the Gordons Pond Trail located in Cape Henlopen State Park. NBC News \"Today\" co-anchor Hoda Kotb also has a home here, often seen on the Boardwalk or at Browseabout Books, a beloved independent bookstore that dates back to 1975.\n\nOther celebrities spotted over the years: Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl, NBA great Michael Jordan, actor Denzel Washington, auteur John Waters, TV host Kathie Lee Gifford, actor Richard Gere and even U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nBy day, the sun and the beach rule with shopping at the town's bountiful boutiques a close second. By night, you can stroll the romantic alleyways lit by string lights where they serve crepes and sell tie-dye after a fine dining experience.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nThere are some staples that have become so intertwined with the town that it's almost a crime not to stop in at least once, if not to just taste what generations of beachgoers have been drawn to.\n\nGrotto Pizza's \"legendary taste\" has several locations in town with its distinctive sauce swirl and use of a mild cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella. Traditionalists should try a couple of other family-owned hometown favorites: Louie's Pizza (since 1974) and Nicola Pizza (since 1971, but now located on Route 1), also home to their famous \"Nic-o-boli\" strombolis.\n\nBesides pizza, the Ocean City, Maryland-founded Thrasher’s with its three Rehoboth locations is a go-to for French fries for decades (try with salt and vinegar!), along with the more down-home Boardwalk legend, Gus & Gus Place. Other Boardwalk spots that have lines for good reason: Kohr Brothers (soft-serve frozen custard), The Ice Cream Store (100-plus varieties of ice cream) and Dolle's (saltwater taffy and caramel popcorn).\n\nBut Rehoboth is much more than beach food for the masses. In fact, its restaurant scene just may arguably be the best in the state, ranging from breweries armed with impressive kitchens to fine dining spots that have foodies flocking.\n\nThe Back Porch Cafe is a classic, splurge-worthy restaurant where \"everything but the baguettes\" are made in-house.\n\nOther favorites include Houston White Co. for steaks and red wine, Lupo Italian Kitchen's to try shaved Brussels sprouts and lobster bucatini, and Henlopen City Oyster House for its impeccable raw oysters and other seafood dishes that never fail to please. Salt Air also has seafood that keeps people coming back, along with a banana cream cake dreams are made of.\n\nMariachi Restaurant is a favorite for Mexican and Latin-American foods, along with Dos Locos with its unique mid-Atlantic take on Mexican food. For Asian cuisine, The Cultured Pearl Restaurant & Sushi Bar is the GOAT for sushi with Stingray as another favorite and Confucius, which boasts an array of upscale Chinese dishes.\n\nFor breakfast, the newly-expanded Egg is a cool spot with inventive offerings such as siracha bacon \"candy\" and a peanut butter French toast sandwich. But if you're really hungry (and hungover), the Crystal Restaurant is a more traditional down-home diner-type setting that draws long waits at peak times.\n\nBars near the beach:Here are 5 new spots for nightlife & bites at Delaware beaches this summer\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nRehoboth Beach has its own King of Beers: Dogfish Head Brewing & Eats. Founded in town in 1995, the brand has helped put Rehoboth on the map, drawing beer tourists from around the world.\n\nPurple Parrot Grill’s outdoor biergarten is a fun detour tucked off Rehoboth Avenue with indoor fun including karaoke and DJs on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights, drawing gay and straight alike.\n\nOther LGBTQ hot spots include AQUA Bar & Grill with a deck that acts as a magnet for day-drinking fun-seekers, along with Rigby's Bar & Grill, Freddie's Beach Bar & Restaurant (a spinoff of the Arlington, Virginia, spot) and Diego's Bar & Nightclub, which boasts an outdoor, sand-filled patio.\n\nAnd if you really want a taste of the local scene, drop into the original Arena's Deli and Bar downtown where deli sandwiches and a full bar collide with live local music Thursday through Sunday during the summer.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe drag scene at Blue Moon, which melds dining with stage shows since 1981, is unmatched. Drag shows sometimes join karaoke at Purple Parrot as well. The LGBTQ organization CAMP Rehoboth has its own arts and culture offerings, as well as Clear Space Theatre Company with its own renditions of musicals and other shows all summer long.\n\nFor live music, Dogfish has a large stage, making bands as important as the beer, just like founder Sam Calagione likes it. You'll find a mix of local, regional and even national acts on their calendar. And if you're willing to head out to the highway, The Pond has local live music nightly, anchored by Thursday nights with hometown standbys Lower Case Blues featuring guitar slinger Jake Banaszak and funky bassist B.J. Muntz.\n\nFor families looking for live music, the Rehoboth Beach Bandstand has it all, ranging from tribute acts and orchestras to local cover bands and military bands. It's been free since first launching in 1963 just off the Boardwalk, giving musicians and fans alike beautiful views and an ocean breeze.\n\nFor the kiddos (and grown kiddos), Funland amusement park (first opened in 1961) is a must-stop with rides and games right on the Boardwalk, with five generations of the Fasnacht family working to keep the throwback just like parents remember from their own childhood.\n\nAbove Ryan's Beach Shop you'll find an 18-hole mini-golf course with killer panoramic views. And if you head out to the highway, Jungle Jim's water park with its waterslides, go-karts and bumper boats is a freshwater alternative to the ocean.\n\nWhat do I need to know about parking?\n\nIf you visit Delaware's biggest beach town, also expect the biggest beach crowds. If you plan to park in a metered space, you're going to be spending a fair amount of time looking for one.\n\nRehoboth Beach parking is by meter or permit only between May 15 and Sept. 15. Meters run 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., while permits are only enforced through 5 p.m.\n\nMeters are $3 an hour and can be paid with quarters or via ParkMobile. Download it before you get there to save a headache. If you're into masochism, change machines are available at the following locations:\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue at First Street,\n\nCenter of Rehoboth Avenue across from City Hall,\n\nThe Parking Department, 1 City Hall Drive\n\nRehoboth has two metered parking lots, off Christian Street next to the senior center and off Rehoboth Avenue next to the Fire Department.\n\nClick here for a map of Rehoboth Beach parking areas.\n\nPermits can be purchased at the Parking Department or from multiple kiosks throughout town. Check the city's website for hours.\n\nDon't forget: All perpendicular or angled parking in Rehoboth Beach, except handicapped, is head-in only.\n\nIf just the thought of spot-hunting on a summer day in Rehoboth causes a blood pressure spike, try DART First State's Park & Ride on the highway. The air-conditioned buses will drop you off at the Bandstand and are able to get you there quicker than a car thanks to bus-only lanes.\n\nWhat do I need to know about the beach?\n\nOnce on the beach, there are no tents, tarps, cabanas, pavilions or canopies allowed, except for small baby tents that must be anchored. Beach umbrellas must not be wider than 7 feet, 6 inches wide.\n\nExpect to be very close to your neighbors. If you have pearls to clutch, leave them at home.\n\nThe entire 2-mile area of beach within the corporate city limits is guarded between Memorial Day and Labor Day, weekdays 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and weekends 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.\n\nIf you're into surf-fishing, it's only permitted when lifeguards are off-duty, except for the beach area between the jetty north of the Henlopen Hotel and 250 feet north. Of course, you'll need a Delaware fishing license.\n\nSorry, pet owners. Dogs are not allowed on the beach or boardwalk between May 1 and Sept. 30.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nThe 6-mile Junction Breakwater Trail from Rehoboth Beach to Lewes gets crowded, but it’s a good option for soft-surface running or walking. For a longer workout, you can connect to the 8-mile Lewes-Georgetown Trail.\n\nGrove Park Canal Dock now hosts Cape Water Tours & Taxi, which offers tours, cruises and taxi service from the dock, much as they do on the Rehoboth and Delaware bays.\n\nAlso, try Cape Henlopen State Park and Gordons Pond to the north or follow the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal south to Thompson Island Preserve.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen raindrops fall, the family-owned Movies at Midway on Coastal Highway is a longtime favorite, as is shopping nearby at Tanger Outlets, also located on the highway.\n\nIf you have wheels, you can also drive out to Dogfish Head's brewery in Milton, located about 13 miles away. It is there where you can get a tour, sip their specialties and eat in the Tasting Room & Kitchen.\n\nThe aforementioned Purple Parrot is a fun place for rainy day drinking and Browseabout Books also offers refuge of a different kind.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, the Fourth of July is the star of the show. When the city hosts its annual fireworks display, a city with only about 1,500 year-round residents draws up to 100,000 some years who fill every square inch of the beach, Boardwalk and sidewalk that can be found. (Get there early and stay late to avoid the nightmare traffic jam each year.)\n\nA Piping Out the Summer parade is held on the Boardwalk on Labor Day to close out the season and The Sea Witch Festival attracts thousands of revelers during the Halloween season, making it well worth an autumnal return to Rehoboth. Also in the fall, the Rehoboth Beach Jazz Festival draws national acts to the beach, playing on stages throughout town.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe Bellmoor Inn & Spa may be an expensive place to stay, but if you like bougie, the breakfast in the morning (free with your stay) is worth it. They have made-to-order omelets and a very nice buffet spread. The hotel now has a bar and you can take your cocktails and sit in the lush courtyard.\n\nAnd when it comes to shopping, boutiques abound, including Bella Luna and its eclectic jewelry, gifts, decor and artwork. For surf shops, try Quiet Storm and Sierra Moon. And to go back in time, '60s-themed Sunshine Octopus has tie-dye, while Gidgets Gadgets has vinyl and retro toys.\n\nDelaware history:8 things to know about newly restored World War II tower in Delaware Seashore State Park\n\nDewey Beach\n\nOnly 20 blocks long and two blocks deep, Dewey is a unique strip at Delaware's beaches, best known for its nightlife.\n\nWhile Dewey can still party hard, the days of the Girls Gone Wild bus stopping in town seem to be long gone as Dewey has grown up a bit over the past decade or so.\n\nMore family-friendly events have been rolled out as the number of families who live in town or visit for vacation has risen a bit.\n\nEven so, summer weekends are dominated by masses of day-and-night drinkers, bopping from bar to bar in search of cover bands and fun.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nDewey is home to only about 300 people year-round, but that number swells in the summer as group beach houses begin to fill, some housing 20 or more people.\n\nBar-hopping in Dewey is as commonplace as reaching for water and aspirin in the morning to soothe a raging hangover. But the town is more than its drinkables.\n\nThere's a cool surfer scene on the ocean side, Rehoboth Bay offers more relaxed water fun, and there are even movies on the beach for the kids.\n\nWhile there are plenty of adults in town (even if some act like children when drunk), the town's relaxed beach vibe also draws teens and tweens running around with lacrosse sticks and skateboards.\n\nThe town's motto is \"A Way of Life\" and it is. With out-of-towners dominating, it still has a tight-knit feel. If you go enough, everyone will know your name, especially if you dress in a ridiculous costume, which is still a familiar Dewey sight.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nSure, Dewey is filled with quick bites. Perhaps the most famous was Mama Celeste's Pizzeria, located next to The Starboard, one of the biggest and most beloved bars in the state, never mind Dewey. Mama Celeste's owners \"Mama\" and \"Papa\" retired in the off-season and it will be open this year as the new Starboard Sauced, serving New York-style slices to late-night hordes of hungry bar-goers. Celeste \"Mama\" Gutt will be working there some days, so you may see her familiar face behind the counter.\n\nBut for a more proper meal, you have to visit Woody's Dewey Beach, best known for its award-winning crab cakes since 2009. It's small. It's busy. It's worth it. They even ship their crab cakes across the country for those who can't make the trip to the beach.\n\nThose looking for healthier options in the land of pizza and fries have found a home at Gary's Dewey Beach Grill, where hummus platters, salads, turkey breast cheesesteaks and sushi are served, along with fresh beer brewed on-site.\n\nIn fact, it's another brewery in town that just may have the best menu: Dewey Beer Co. Its slightly higher-end offerings have more of a Rehoboth Beach restaurant scene feel, allowing for more civilized meals of shrimp and chorizo lo mein, chicken & waffles and steak sandwiches.\n\nThe Starboard is a favorite for brunch, especially their weekly \"Suicide Sunday\" celebrations with a massive Bloody Mary bar and a singing Elvis impersonator wandering around the bar. For an open-air lunch under a roof with live music, try Jimmy's Grille Dewey, best known for its fried chicken.\n\nAlso, the old Hammerheads will be replaced by the new Starboard Claw.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nDid you say drink? You're in the right town.\n\nThere are four major bars, all with their own vibe and all within a half-mile.\n\nWe'll start with The Starboard, the iconic bar with a shark head busting out of the top of the building. A hodgepodge of bar rooms, the 'Board is home to the best Orange Crush in town. It's not even close. They are served in 16-ounce cups with oversized straws for extra-easy drinking and come in many flavors: orange, grapefruit, lemon, watermelon, mango and more. Throw in DJs, live music and celebrities (we're looking at you, Delaware native Ryan Phillippe) and you have a night to remember ... or perhaps a night to try to remember.\n\nThe other three major watering holes are owned by the same restaurant group so you'll see a lot of the same acts, drinks and people. Still, each is a unique slice of Dewey.\n\nThe Rusty Rudder with its large deck and Rehoboth Bay views is more easy-going during the day and turns up at night with cover bands. Local legends Love Seed Mama Jump have a Thursday night residency there that has been going for decades.\n\nFour blocks north is northbeach, also located along the bay with killer sunset views. A sandy patio along the water is the perfect place to try the bar's signature frozen Dewey Devil drink. The bar draws a younger crowd, especially at night, encouraged by DJs and dancing inside.\n\nA block from northbeach is the Bottle & Cork, a 21-only nightclub that hosts national acts with a schedule that has been weighted more toward modern country in recent years. But it's the Cork's Saturday \"Jam Session\" that makes it special. The tradition begins at 5 p.m. and usually rotates three to four cover bands until 1 a.m. A sea of crushed beer cans cover the ground by the end.\n\nOther spots to hit include Hawaiian-themed Nalu Surf Bar & Grill, Dewey Beach Country Club (a golf-themed bar, not an actual golf course) and The Lighthouse, a long-serving favorite recently rebuilt after a fire.\n\nAnd Dewey Beer Co. has more than good food — it boasts the top-ranked beers in the state.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nNearly every bar in town hosts cover acts or DJs, some both day and night. It's what Dewey does and it does it well.\n\nIn addition, the town added Nick's Mini Golf recently, a small course where Ed's Chicken and Crabs stood until a single-car accident caused a fire in 2016.\n\nAnother family-friendly idea is the free weekly movie nights on the beach, a partnership between Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce and the town of Dewey Beach. Films screen Mondays at 8:30 p.m. on the beach at Dagsworthy Street. Glow necklaces are available for a $1 donation.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nSeasonal parking permits are available for those staying in town awhile. You can purchase them via an automated kiosk outside of the Town Hall, at 105 Rodney Ave., or online.\n\nOtherwise, between May 15 and Sept. 15, the ParkMobile app makes paying (and adding time) much easier. Metered spaces are $3 an hour. Some take coins but not all.\n\nMore:More sand coming to Delaware beaches faster. Schedule moved up as another dredger arrives.\n\nBe warned: Finding a metered spot in Dewey can take time and patience in the summer. But there is a silver lining: Parking in Dewey is free Monday through Wednesday from 5 to 11 p.m. Also, those with handicapped license plates or placards park for free.\n\nAs for the actual beach, rules allow surf fishing, bonfires with a permit and dogs before 9:30 a.m. and after 5:30 p.m. during the summer.\n\nCanopies, umbrellas and open-sided tents are permitted on the beach, but should be behind the lifeguard stands so they can see the water. No alcohol is allowed on the beach during the summer.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nDewey Beach Watersports is your gateway to fun on the bay, offering personal watercraft, pontoon, stand-up paddleboard, kayak and bike rentals. They also offer fun \"banana boat\" rides on a tube.\n\nAnother option is Cruisin' Tikis, a six-person tiki bar boat that goes out on the bay for a unique BYOB experience on the water.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nWhen the beach is a washout, The Starboard's digital billboard out front always has the same message: \"When it rains, we pour!\" The bar fills with wet party-seekers and can be a rowdy scene, even in the morning hours.\n\nJust south of Dewey, you'll find the Indian River Lifesaving Station, which dates back to 1876 when it was built to save shipwreck victims near the coast. It has been restored to its 1905 appearance and is an interesting visit on a rainy day for history buffs.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIn the summer, there is only one event that matters: Running of the Bull.\n\nHeld each July, the straight-up goofy event at The Starboard features two people in a bull costume crossing the highway (with a police escort) followed by hundreds of the bar's patrons. They then all run along the beach and return to the bar parking lot where a celebrity matador squares off with the bull, capping one of the weirdest (and most fun) events the state has to offer. Started by a handful of Starboard regulars in 1997, it now draws thousands dressed in red and white just like in Pamplona, Spain.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nOne of the best parties in Dewey each year happens after the summertime visitors leave. The Dewey Business Partnership hosts an all-ages end-of-season party in mid-September on the beach from New Orleans Street to Dagsworthy Street, complete with a band on stage and alcohol and food in hands. It usually costs $5.\n\nTake the ferry:Have you ever been on the Cape May-Lewes Ferry? Here's everything you need to know\n\nLewes\n\nIf you're looking for more of that New England seaport town feel, Lewes is for you.\n\nUnlike some other beach towns in the state, Lewes has a large year-round population, giving it more of a hometown vibe than a tourist trap.\n\nWith the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal cutting through town and a beautiful Lewes Canalfront Park to watch the boats go by, it's about as scenic as it gets.\n\nThrow in historic houses, a slower pace than Rehoboth and Dewey, and its fair share of fine restaurants and you realize why it's one of Delaware's best towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nIts charming, historic blocks boast quaint homes, Dutch architecture and blooming tulips everywhere in the spring. And if you want to visit the Jersey Shore, the Cape May-Lewes Ferry terminal is right near the beach, ready to bring you and your car the 17 miles across Delaware Bay.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nAgave Mexican Restaurant is a true gem and a local favorite. So much so that the long wait there is a punchline because of the crowds. Started in 2007 with 30 seats, they now have two locations (the other is out on Coastal Highway near Rehoboth). Be sure to try the puffy fish tacos, margaritas and even a flight of guacamole. (There's one on Del. 1 as well.)\n\nFor fine dining, Heirloom is a must-visit. Delaware Online/The News Journal food writer Patricia Talorico once wrote it \"might be Delaware's best restaurant,\" wowed by the \"feminine, but not at all frilly, upscale restaurant\" with entrees ranging from pan-seared scallops to grilled flank steak.\n\nOther fun stops include The Station on Kings cafe and market for pastries, Touch of Italy for sandwiches, Mr. P's for wood-fired pizza and Raas for some of the best Indian food in the state.\n\nFamilies really like Crooked Hammock Brewery. It's not just for the fresh beer for parents, but the \"Backyard\" filled with family-friendly games like ping pong, ring toss and cornhole.\n\nFor breakfast, Kaisy’s Delights is a treasure with omelets, quiches and croque monsieur sandwiches. Try the signature Kaisy bowl for dessert. Also, Bountiful Bowls is good for an acai bowl and Nectar Cafe for great brunch and juices/mimosas. And if you can get to Coastal Highway, Surf Bagel has bagels that even New Yorkers will concede are delicious.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nWhile most bars and restaurants close by 10 p.m., it doesn't mean the night has to be over. Irish Eyes Pub & Restaurant stays open until 1 a.m.\n\nBefore it gets late, the Crooked Hammock and Big Oyster breweries offer fresh brews. Try Solar Power, a Belgian blonde from Big Oyster, which is like a Blue Moon beer on steroids.\n\nOne of the most scenic spots to grab a drink is Grain on the Rocks, located right at the ferry terminal near the beach. Striper Bites, a casual bistro, is also a favorite bar/restaurant for many who like a nightcap.\n\nHalf Full is the place to go if you want to grab a glass of wine or appetizer while waiting for tables at Agave or Striper Bites and Nassau Valley Vineyards is a 4-mile drive inland.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nCrooked Hammock and Irish Eyes often host local music acts, as does Stango Park with its Summer Concert Series on Tuesday nights. On Coastal Highway, blues can usually be found at Bethany Blues BBQ.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Grain began hosting large-scale concerts at its waterfront location, selling seats in socially distanced pods. Its Rocking the Docks concert series has lived on with ticketed shows under the stars with the Robert Randolph Band (June 21) and Dumpstaphunk (August 23) among the acts.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nLewes has a calm and shallow beach, which is great for children. Don't plan on seeing any surfing or boogie boarding.\n\nLewes beaches have a little loophole for dogs in the summer season. They're permitted, leashed, before 8 a.m. and after 6 p.m. Surf-fishing is similar: Only before 8 a.m. or after 6:30 p.m.\n\nBeach parking lot meters are in use May 1 to Sept. 30 and downtown meters through Oct. 14. Meters are in use in all areas from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nMeters are $2.50 per hour at the beaches and $1.50 per hour downtown. There is a three-hour maximum downtown. Quarters are accepted only at downtown meters (a change machine is located at Mary Vessels Park, behind Biblion on 2nd Street), while cash is only accepted at the beach parking lots. Credit cards are accepted for all metered parking through the ParkMobile app, with a 50-cent fee.\n\nThere is limited metered parking at the beach with many deciding to park at nearby Cape Henlopen State Park instead. Also, check out the new Lewes Line pilot program that can be picked up all over town.\n\nAnd be sure to walk up to the nearby Dairy Queen for a cone, like locals have done since it came to town in 1954.\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nIf you walk around Lewes, you'll find plenty out there.\n\nThe Lewes and Rehoboth Canal and Lewes Canalfront Park are the crown jewels, but also try Blockhouse Pond at George H.P. Smith Park for a peaceful getaway with a little bass fishing if you're up for it. (Fisherman also can be found at the wharf by the drawbridge.)\n\nThe Lewes Unleashed Dog Park is great for your four-legged friend or if you just want to see doggies out there playing. The Georgetown-Lewes Trail is worth a walk with a big chunk of it running through town. People who live along it go all out with landscaping and decorations.\n\nJust south of town is the 5,193-acre Cape Henlopen State Park filled with all sorts of outdoor fun, a beach and a nature center.\n\nGordons Pond is also a fun trail for a walk or run. You can connect from the beach via the bike loop or park at Herring Point or Gordons Pond and go from there.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nGo shopping inside at The Brush Factory Kings (unique home goods) or try a rum tasting at Beach Time Distilling.\n\nAs we mentioned in the Rehoboth Beach entry, Movies at Midway is great for rainy day films. Also try Lefty's Alley & Eats with bowling, laser tag, ax-throwing and an arcade all under one roof.\n\nShell We Bounce Trampoline Park is also open, giving your kids an opportunity to bounce around so much that they fall asleep early that night.\n\nBiblion Used Books and Rare Finds, as well as its sister store The Vintage Underground, are great for cozy escapes in Lewes. You can probably find something for anyone: the bookworm, the person who likes buttons with sassy sayings, the record lover and more.\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nDuring the summer, you should try to be there for the Fourth of July holiday when the annual Doo-Dah Parade kicks off. Dating back to 1968, you can watch or join the fun-loving parade. Just be sure to be wearing red, white and blue because everyone else will be.\n\nThe same day also offers the Lewes Independence Day Boat Parade with decorated boats making their way along the canal as spectators watch from the canal banks.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nThe historic Lewes Farmers Market is a must and probably the best in the state. And try the rotisserie chicken at Lloyd’s Market, a terrific family-owned market that has local produce and milk from Lewes Dairy.\n\nDelaware Seashore State Park:5 things to do, admission, eats and more\n\nBethany Beach\n\nThis tidy coastal town greets visitors on Coastal Highway with its 24-foot Chief Little Owl landmark totem pole made by sculptor Peter Wolf Toth.\n\nWith its own half-mile Boardwalk — half the size of Rehoboth's — the \"Quiet Resort\" is a dainty throwback that draws an older crowd looking for a slower pace than other bustling beach towns.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nBethany has none of the buzz of Rehoboth or Dewey and that's by design.\n\nMany restaurants close by 10 p.m. even on weekends. Good luck finding a bar with a band. Bars — establishments that focus mostly on selling alcohol — are not allowed in town, and bands are mostly relegated to the town's Bandstand.\n\nFamilies and retirees dominate the area, which has a small number of shops downtown — and almost all are not chains, though Five Guys arrived several years back.\n\nThe Boardwalk isn't mobbed like Rehoboth or Ocean City and most businesses have built up out on Route 26, which has seen plenty of growth as more and more restaurateurs and retail shops have moved in.\n\nOverall, it's a sleepy getaway. Perhaps that's why actor (and New Castle native) Ryan Phillippe purchased a summer home here for seasonal escapes from Los Angeles.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nIf you're traveling from the Rehoboth/Dewey Beach area, there are a couple of restaurants on the way to Bethany that offer unbelievable views near the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nFirst is Big Chill Beach Club with its 360-degree views from an iconic circular bar high above the Atlantic Ocean, offering beers and bites in the sun. On the other side of the bridge in Delaware Seashore Park, you'll find a real hidden gem: the former Hammerheads Dockside, now a Big Fish Restaurant Group's Dockside Marina Bar + Grill. It had been a small eatery and bar complete with a sandy patio with palm trees and live music on a stage along the dock. Expect more of the same, but with the Big Fish stamp all over it.\n\nThe newest addition to the Bethany area is on Route 26 in the form of SoDel Concepts' Ocean View Brewing Co., which brews its own fresh beer and offers a unique menu with favorites like fried chicken and food challenges like The Naptime: a sandwich with doughnut buns, a fried lobster tail and fried egg. (Um, what?!?)\n\nSoDel also has a pair of seafood-themed menus that draw crowds at Matt's Fish Camp and Bluecoast, along with North East Seafood Kitchen in Ocean View, just outside of town.\n\nFans of Italian must stop at DiFebo's Restaurant and slurp on some of Big Bob's Sunday gravy or try their nearby DiFebo's Market, filled with local goodies, baked goods, paninis and homemade deli case items.\n\nA family-style local's pick on the highway is The Cottage Cafe, owned by a pair of college buddies since opening in 1993, serving down-home breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nIn downtown, the large-scale Mango's has stunning beach views, a happy hour that fills the bar and a menu that has everything from tacos and steak to burgers and seafood. A block away is Bethany Blues BBQ, which smokes its own meats for lovers of brisket and pulled pork. (A new, third location will open in downtown Rehoboth Beach this summer.)\n\nOther area restaurants worth your money: Sedona (American cuisine), 14 Global (tapas/small plates), Mickey's Family Crab House and Misaki (sushi).\n\nFor sweets, try Sandy Pony Donuts with their mouth-watering hot, made-to-order doughnuts. They got their start as a food truck on Chincoteague Island and expanded northward. Oh, and Rosenfeld's Big Fish in South Bethany offers cake slices as big as your head and hefty one-pound eclairs (along with Jewish deli standbys.)\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nMango's with its lively bar and beach views is the most fun you'll have in downtown.\n\nIf you drive just outside the town limits, you'll find Bethany Boathouse on the highway with a fun beachy atmosphere and a nighttime party vibe worth checking out.\n\nBethany Blues also has a large bar filled with bourbons and The Salted Rim Margarita Bar & Grille further out on Route 26 in Millville has margaritas away from the beach crowds.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nThe Bethany Bandstand has musical acts on Thursday evenings if you want the \"Pleasantville\" experience of a small-town event.\n\nMango's hosts bands Friday and Saturdays at 10 p.m. until they close at 11:30 p.m., and acoustic acts can be found at Bethany Blues BBQ on Saturdays for happy hour.\n\nBethany Boathouse takes advantage of being outside the town limits by offering the most entertainment around with nightly live music and a true bar experience for those looking for late-night excitement.\n\nAnd don't forget that the Freeman Arts Pavilion with national acts is only 9 miles away, and the Jolly Trolley will pick you up in town for select shows so you can leave your car behind.\n\nWant to head inland? Shipwrecked Mini Golf & Ice Cream is about 2 miles west off Route 26. Also, check out the Millville Boardwalk for mini-golf, ice cream and even a giant beach ball pit.\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nThere are plenty of no-nos: no tents, canopies, tarps, cabanas, ball playing, kites or alcohol, and umbrellas can be up to only 3 feet wide. No dogs on the beach or boardwalk from May 15 to Sept. 30. Surf-fishing is allowed only when lifeguards are off-duty.\n\nAll perpendicular or angled parking is head-in only in Bethany Beach. It's pay- or permit-to-park May 15 through Sept. 15, between 10 a.m. and 4, 8 or 11 p.m., as indicated by signage. There is a two-hour limit on Garfield Parkway.\n\nMeter rates are $2.50 per hour, paid via ParkMobile or using credit cards or quarters at pay stations and meters. Change machines can be found throughout the beach and 100 blocks of Garfield Parkway, as well as at North Pennsylvania Avenue and Central Boulevard.\n\nParking in Bethany Beach is very limited. Metered parking can be found on Garfield Parkway, the beach blocks, Atlantic Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue. Most other downtown parking areas are reserved for those with residential or business permits.\n\nThis map of Bethany Beach parking areas will help with any confusion. Probably.\n\nParking permits can be purchased at the Police Department (214 Garfield Parkway) at a rate of $25 per day, $75 for three days and $175 for seven days. Permits are valid in all pay-to-park areas except Garfield Parkway.\n\nAnd here's a quaint option: Trolleys continuously run from the Friday before Memorial Day through mid-September between 9:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and cost only a quarter. (Driver does not make change, so time to hunt for some coins!)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFresh Pond just north of town off the coast is part of Delaware Seashore State Park, an oasis with walking trails and the nearby James Farm Ecological Preserve.\n\nRight on Coastal Highway, you'll find the 6.8-acre Bethany Beach Central Park for a whole lot of manicured grass and pickup games.\n\nSeven miles out of town you'll find Holt's Landing State Park, a 203-acre bayside escape with a salt marsh, forest, hiking trails, crabbing, a boat launch and family fun nights with music.\n\nAnd if you're thinking about where you might want to stay next time you visit, look into the Indian River Cottage rentals north of Bethany Beach at Delaware Seashore State Park. They're perfect for a more quiet and secluded experience, so book early.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nFor kids — and the grown-up kids that come out in some of us on summer vacations — video games, Skee-Ball, air hockey and pinball can be found at the Shore Fun Family Fun Center just off the Boardwalk.\n\nDickens Parlour Theatre, located 5 miles west of town, hosts nightly magic performances during the summer, along with live music.\n\nWhen it rains, the town's independent bookstore fills (Bethany Beach Books) as does Bethany Beach Comics and Gaming, along with the dozen or so boutique shops that can be found along Route 26.\n\nIf Daddy or Mommy needs a drink, Salted Vines Vineyard & Winery is a 15-minute drive west for wine, live music and food trucks. (They say children are welcome but must be under the supervision of an adult at all times.)\n\nWhat are the don’t-miss annual events?\n\nIf you stay until the end of Labor Day weekend, definitely attend the Bethany Beach Jazz Funeral, which dates back to 1985. A jazz band will mourn the \"death\" of the summer with a march down the Boardwalk as others pretend to weep, dressed in black. Totally unique.\n\nAlso, the Fourth of July fireworks on Bethany Beach is about as red, white and blue as you can get, complete with live music at the Bandstand.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nTake a 20-minute drive south to theAssawoman Bay State Wildlife Area. Sure the name will make the kids giggle, but you'll find more than laughs there: bald eagles, herons, egrets, woodpeckers, deer, amphibians, reptiles and more.\n\nFenwick Island\n\nLet's get one thing straight right off the bat: Fenwick Island is not an island just like Coney Island is not an island.\n\nBut it is a tiny beach town that reports only about 350 people as residents. Unlike Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey and Bethany, it has a beach and that's about it except for a few restaurants (some of which are quite good) and shops.\n\nWhat makes it unique?\n\nThere's no Boardwalk or large-scale amusements, but they don't need it since they border the massive, touristy Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nEven though Fenwick is quiet, it's not quite like Bethany since the excitement of Ocean City sometimes spills over.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nJames Beard-nominated chef Matt Kern purchased Fenwick farm-to-table restaurant One Coastal, giving the local favorite a shot in the arm with high-end entrees worth the money. (He had previously been at Heirloom in Lewes.)\n\nJust like in Bethany, the beach-based SoDel Concepts restaurant group runs a handful of spots that bring in the bodies during the summer, including seafood-heavy menus at Catch 54 (with sweet bay views) and Matt's Fish Camp and Mexican cuisine atPapa Grande's.\n\nOther dining rooms to drop into include Our Harvest (platter-style feasts available), Nantucket's (fine dining seafood) and Warren’s Station, which is family-friendly and does not serve drinks.\n\nAnd for your sweet tooth, a Fisher’s Popcorn with caramel popcorn of all flavors — a perfect gift to bring back for whoever is watching your dog.\n\nWhere to drink?\n\nThe bayside Harpoon Hanna's off Route 54 is your best shot at a beachlike, fun bar experience, complete with a Tiki bar, nightly live music and a sports bar that's open until 1 a.m. It's also a scenic spot for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch.\n\nWhere to be entertained?\n\nViking Golf & Go-Karts is tucked away off Coastal Highway on Island Street with 18 holes of golf, go-karts and water park in one spot.\n\nAnd just like for your Bethany visits, it's a short drive to Freeman Arts Pavilion for ticketed concerts with national acts. (It's 5 miles east of town, and Jolly Trolley offers rides for select shows to and from Fenwick.)\n\nWhat do I need to know about going to the beach?\n\nParking requires paying a meter or purchasing a permit in Fenwick Island, between 9 a.m. and 10 p.m. from May 15 to September 15.\n\nDogs aren't allowed on the beach May 1 through September 30. Surf fishing is permitted only when lifeguards are off-duty, unless they say otherwise.\n\nIf you go to Fenwick Island State Park, you should get there real early on weekends because the small lot fills up very quickly. (It's $5 for residents and $20 for non-residents.)\n\nGetting outdoors beyond the sand\n\nFenwick Island State Park has 3 miles of ocean beaches for swimming and surf fishing, along with access to Little Assawoman Bay with kayaking and stand-up paddleboards available.\n\nWhat to do on a rainy day?\n\nThe DiscoverSea Shipwreck Museum on Coastal Highway is a great escape — just like some of the tales you'll find inside with rotating exhibits that focus on maritime heritage with 10,000 artifacts to dig through.\n\nHidden gems you should know about\n\nIt's easy to miss, but Jimmy's Kitchen on Coastal Highway is that greasy spoon breakfast spot that draws locals early, opening at 7 a.m. and closing 5½ hours later each day. Try the chipped beef or \"The Heavyroller,\" a five-egg omelet that may send you right back to bed.\n\nThe staff of Delaware Online/The News Journal contributed to this report. Have a story idea?

He also was active in charitable and civic organizations, serving on the boards of several organizations and took on many pro bono services.\n\nDespite his busy schedule, Kelly's daughter, Joanna, said he always made time for his family.\n\n\"He always knew what was important and I think he was really good at prioritizing,\" she said. \"I don't think he missed one of my brother's or my athletic games or matches.\"\n\n\"He never sacrificed those things,\" she said.\n\nPerhaps the energy he had to do all that he did came from a family motto, \"Kellys don't quit.\" It could also be that Kelly found energy in fighting for what was right, no matter the cost.\n\n\"He always used to say that 'the true mark of a good person is to help those who can't help you back,'\" Joanna Kelly said. \"He absolutely did that. He lived that every day of his life.\"\n\nWhile Kelly often spoke or joked of his Irish heritage, his mother and grandmother were Lebanese, helping broaden his view and acceptance of different cultures, his daughter said.\n\n\"It was just this beautiful mixture of experiences that made him such a great empathetic and loving person that everyone could connect with,\" she said. \"I think that added so much to my father's upbringing, my father's life, as well as his siblings' lives.\"\n\nKelly litigated high-profile cases in state and federal courts nationwide.\n\n\"The McCarter family mourns the loss of Michael P. Kelly, an amazing lawyer, compassionate human being, and extraordinary friend and leader,\" reads a statement from McCarter & English Chairman Joseph Lubertazzi and Joseph Boccassini, the firmwide managing partner.\n\n\"As a passionate advocate, Mike won the trust and respect of clients, judges, and fellow lawyers throughout the country, who admired his incredible intellect, energy, and commitment.\n\n\"As a leader and Chair of the Executive Committee, he transformed McCarter into a national firm that reflected his own strength and compassion, and greatly expanded both its service capabilities and pro bono commitment. He was a true and loyal friend and has left an indelible mark on all those he touched.\n\n\"His integrity, brilliance and unwavering devotion to the countless people, communities and charitable causes he served will live on among the colleagues and friends he guided, mentored and lifted up. We will miss him greatly.\"\n\nEven though he was seriously ill, Kelly most recently was lead counsel for former Wilmington Trust President Robert V.A. Harra Jr., during the Wilmington Trust bank fraud trial.\n\nIn 2017, Kelly requested to delay the start of the trial while he finished necessary medical treatments, but the request was denied by a federal judge. Kelly remained as Harra’s defense attorney for the 2018 trial.\n\nFour former top executives of Wilmington Trust, including Harra, were facing prison time after being found guilty of bank fraud and conspiracy, but in 2021 a federal appeals court overturned the historic criminal fraud convictions.\n\nKelly said he didn't understand why the case was ever brought forward.\n\n\"This case was an incredible waste of taxpayer dollars that literally ruined the lives of four innocent people,\" Kelly said in January 2021. \"Rob and his family have endured nothing less than a nightmare for almost 10 years now.\"\n\nIn 2016, Kelly represented New Castle County Executive Thomas P. Gordon and the county in a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by former county Chief Administrative Officer David Grimaldi. The former county aide was seeking severance and unspecified damages. Grimaldi later withdrew that claim. Other claims made by him against Gordon and the county were later tossed out of court.\n\n\"I think the judge got it right,\" Kelly said in 2018 after a Sussex County Superior Court judge dismissed a final defamation claim. \"It was a big nothing burger.\"\n\nKelly, who served on the Delaware Judicial Nominating Commission, was remembered as \"a larger than life character,\" by Gov. John Carney.\n\n\"He just had an incredible appreciation for every person he came in contact with, which was in part the result of being raised in his father's bar,\" Carney said.\n\n\"Mike had a great understanding of people, especially those who were down on their luck. And he cared about what matters most – his family, his faith, and his friends. What people don't know about Mike is all the people he helped along the way – all the pro bono work he did and the advice he gave sitting around the bar. It went back to those values that were so important to him, passed down from his dad, John D. Kelly III.\n\n\"Mike was just such a huge presence in every room he walked into, and he'll be greatly missed. Like so many people I've talked to, I find myself laughing through my tears as I think about the loss of Mike. Tracey and I are keeping Mike's family and his many friends in our thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nFormer Gov. Jack Markell also had kind words for Kelly.\n\n\"There are few people in this world who can generate laughter from 1,000 people at a Gridiron dinner, win tough legal cases that few lawyers would want to take on, lead a major U.S. law firm, help anybody and everybody who asks for a hand, and is a devoted husband and parent,\" Markell said.\n\n\"Mike was all of that and more. He was a gem.\"\n\nWhile serving as chairman of New Castle County's Board of Adjustment in the 1990s, Kelly often displayed shrewd judgment and his trademark funny quips.\n\nIn 1992, well-known builder John A. “Jack” Corrozi Sr. had to come before the Board of Adjustment to ask for a variance on a home he built for himself in Newark.\n\nCorrozi, embarrassed, knew that without the variance he would have to knock down part of his garage and family room.\n\n“I’d sue the builder if I were you,\" Kelly joked to Corrozi after listening to the zoning appeal.\n\nCorrozi mumbled he was considering it. He was granted the variance.\n\nDuring a roast of retiring Delaware public defender Larry Sullivan in 2009, Kelly got some of the biggest laughs with his facetious comments.\n\nSullivan was a longtime friend of Kelly's father, John D. Kelly III, a former sheriff and New Castle County register of chancery. Mike Kelly thanked the 72-year-old for being there during life's tough moments.\n\n\"When I lost my job, you were there. When I lost my house, you were there,\" Mike Kelly told Sullivan. \"So what I'm trying to say publicly, Larry – you're bad luck.\"\n\nKelly, a graduate of Tower Hill School, Columbia University and Dickinson School of Law, had deep Delaware roots.\n\nIn 1889, his great-grandfather John D. “Whiskers” Kelly bought an Italianate three-story building at Delaware Avenue and North Du Pont Street.\n\nThe brick structure, built as a hotel around 1864 by William Wharton Jr., is now on the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel, named after American Civil War Gen. John A. Logan, had a tavern on the first floor and rooms to rent upstairs. It also had a barbershop for a time.\n\n\"Whiskers\" Kelly turned it into a tavern, hotel and a home for his large family. He passed the site onto family members through the years.\n\nThe Kelly family has said it is the oldest continuously run family-owned Irish bar in the country.\n\nMike Kelly's father, John D. Kelly III, a co-founder of Wilmington's St. Patrick's parade, renovated the building in 1982. He added live entertainment in hopes of attracting a younger crowd.\n\nKelly's Logan House has since become one of the state's most popular taverns. It has undergone several renovations through the years and a rite of passage for many Delawareans is ordering a drink at the bar.\n\n\"It's in my blood. I spent so much of my life here,\" Kelly said in a 2014 Delaware Online/The News Journal interview with reporter Ryan Cormier shortly before the Wilmington landmark's 150th anniversary.\n\nKelly said he worked as a bartender at the Logan House and, just like his father, he would oftentimes have to work double duty as a bouncer. Being an amateur boxer helped him handle unruly customers.\n\n\"I would say a 'Hail Mary' and 'Our Father' before every shift. I never started a fight in my life, but I had to end a few,\" he said.\n\nKelly said working at the family bar also helped him in his law career.\n\n\"When I'm in front of a jury, I'm not drawing upon what I learned at Tower Hill School or Columbia University. I'm drawing upon what I learned at the Logan House,\" he said.\n\n\"That's where I learned how to talk and relate to people.\"\n\nWhile Kelly had been battling cancer for years, he still would visit the Logan House where his presence was felt.\n\n\"As soon as he walked in the room, we knew he was there,\" said Joe Mujica, Logan House's general manager. \"He lit up the room that he was in, whether it was with a story, a joke, just asking how your family was doing.\"\n\nKelly's genuine desire to help people gave him an energy that kept him going, Mujica said. It was also something that Kelly appreciated in others.\n\nMujica was a recently hired server at Logan House in July 2016 when he was at the bar on his day off. Seeing the staff swamped, Mujica began cleaning off a table where a stranger was sitting.\n\nThe man asked if he was working on his day off and they had a brief conversation. Mujica would later learn the man was Kelly.\n\n\"From knowing him now, it seemed he liked the enthusiasm with it and wanting to get things done,\" Mujica said. \"It was all about the team and making things better.\"\n\nKelly's survivors include his wife, Deanna Henderson Kelly; children Joanna Gerard Kelly and Michael Patrick Kelly Jr.; twin brother, John; and sister, Mary Ann Kelly MacDonald.\n\nFriends and family can visit from 2 to 8 p.m. Thursday at McCrery Harra Funeral Home, 3924 Concord Pike. A Mass of Christian Burial will be at 1 p.m. Friday, Jan. 14 at St. Ann’s Catholic Church, 2013 Gilpin Ave., Wilmington. Burial will be private.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at (302) 324-2861, ptalorico@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @pattytalorico.

The hotel, named after American Civil War General John A. Logan, had a tavern on the first floor and rooms to rent upstairs. It also had its own barbershop for a time.\n\n\"The Logan House was part of the grand plan for that neighborhood,\" Briggs says. \"Along with Joshua Heald, Wharton planned to bring the railway out to build this suburbia and encourage people to move out of the city and use the railway system to get back and forth to work.\"\n\nLoHo lore states that everyone from gangster Al Capone and gunfighter \"Wild Bill\" Hickok stayed there. As owner Michael P. Kelly remembers, \"In the early '60s, they were still talking about the $100 tip Capone left.\"\n\nKelly is son of longtime Logan House owner and former New Castle County sheriff John D. Kelly III, who also is a co-founder of the Wilmington's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade. The personable and comedic John D. Kelly III, who died in 2003, took over control of the Logan House in the early 1960s, more than 70 years after his grandfather, John D. \"Whiskers\" Kelly, bought it in September 1889.\n\nMichael P. Kelly, who works full-time as chairman of the Newark, N.J.-based McCarter & English law firm with more than 400 attorneys in seven cities along the East Coast, still finds himself drawn to his family's still-standing legacy, now officially on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"It's in my blood. I spent so much of my life here,\" Kelly says this week over a blackened Mahi wrap and a diet Coke in the Logan House's side dining room. (He stopped drinking four years ago.) \"There's a certain mysticism to this place. We all feel it.\"\n\nThrough the years, Kelly would sometimes be the only one working at the bar and just like his own father, he would often times have to work double duty as a bouncer. Thankfully, both the elder and younger Kelly were amateur boxers. \"I would say a 'Hail Mary' and 'Our Father' before every shift. I never started a fight in my life, but I had to end a few,\" Kelly says.\n\nAfter all, it's the place where his grandfather was born, his sister Mary Anne was married and where he and his siblings would go for lunch while their St. Ann School classmates went home for peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. It's also where his family's legacy of charity still resides, hosting a seemingly endless string of runs and bar events to help non-profits.\n\nAccording to Kelly, the Logan House is the oldest continuously operated bar owned by the same family in the United States. In fact, his 90-year-old mother Loretta still owns the building. Even as the years ago by, Kelly is still dedicated to the bar and finds that it still fuels him, even when he's doing his day job as an attorney.\n\n\"When I'm in front of a jury, I'm not drawing upon what I learned at Tower Hill School or Columbia University. I'm drawing upon what I learned at the Logan House,\" says Kelly, 57, who leaves the day-to-day operations up to general manager Tim Crowley. \"That's where I learned how to talk and relate to people.\"\n\nSo how big of a deal is the Logan House's multi-generational legacy in Forty Acres, where \"Forty Acres\" author Briggs still lives?\n\n\"I doubt you could come across a single person who doesn't have a colorful story about the Logan House,\" she says. \"It's a rite of passage for some when they are turning 21, they go to the Logan House. It's an institution.\n\n\"When my cousin John comes to visit from Ireland, that's one of the stops he has to make when he's here. As the Irish say, they have to stop in for a couple of jars.\"\n\nSometimes, the love for the Logan House can get out of hand.\n\nIts unofficial mascot – a 4-foot, 150-pound wooden leprechaun – has been battered over the years.\n\nOne time someone stole the arms off the little guy and left them crossed and leaning against the front door a few days later. And then there was the time when a bachelor party was caught red-handed trying to hustle the leprechaun into their limo bus before being stopped.\n\nAnd then in 2007, the unnamed (and downright tortured) leprechaun was stolen and never returned, even with a no-cover-for-life bounty offered. It was then that Darren Hussey, owner of BigBronze.com, a Newark business that sells imported bronze and wooden statuary, made a replacement. And, of course, the replacement has since been stolen and has not yet been replaced.\n\nFor Porter, being part of the house band at the Logan House for 20 years was special, especially since he had a hand in building the first second-floor stage and also built the tiki bar out back. After all, the bar has been there for generations of Delawareans. And for many, it's still the center of the universe when it comes to Trolley Square's famously vibrant bar scene.\n\n\"I never took it for granted. I really loved the atmosphere,\"says Porter, who now lives in Chadds Ford, Pa. \"I felt extremely privileged and lucky to have that gig.\"\n\n-- Ryan Cormier, The News Journal.

The good shows and the bad. The mosh pits and empty dance floors. The make-out sessions in the front row and the blow-out fights among tipsy couples.\n\nSTORY: 35 additions to this summer’s beach scene\n\nSTORY: 360-degree views at beach's newest waterfront bar\n\nSTORY: Breaking down Bromberg's Big Noise line-up\n\nAnd last weekend, the longest serving Logan House team member other than the owners powered down his gear for the last time and spent this past week moving his equipment out of the room that has been his nighttime weekend home for decades.\n\nThat's right. Digital Dave has left the building.\n\nEven though he revelled in the gig, enjoying being in the middle of it all in Delaware's oldest Irish bar, Mudrock decided it was time to focus more on his audio/visual production company, 23rd Century Inc.\n\n\"Everything comes to an end, but I'll miss everything about it. It a once-in-a-lifetime job,\" says Mudrock, who still doesn't know why the band Sparks long ago dubbed him \"Digital Dave,\" a nickname that stuck even though he's an analog fan. \"The Kelly family has done so much to support the local music scene. It really was a pleasure to work there every night.\"\n\nHe kept his departure pretty quiet, giving only management and a couple of the last bands he worked with a heads up.\n\nIt was early Sunday morning when the frontman for Newark cover band Radio Halo broke the news to the crowd before their final song: it would be Mudrock's final song as well.\n\n\"We quieted down and I announced that he had been there forever and had the crowd say, 'Thank you Digital Dave' to him,'\" says Dave Hepner, who dedicated the final song – Fall Out Boy's \"Sugar, We're Goin Down\" – to Mudrock. \"He stood up and took a bow.\"\n\nMudrock, who worked at the Wilmington club Bottlecaps before the Logan House, can quickly rattle off the names of some of the more memorable local acts he worked with, including Wilmington jam band Montana Wildaxe, which once had a longtime monthly residency. Others that stream into his mind include Chorduroy, Pete Casey and Seven Rings, Tommy Conwell, John Faye, Nick Bucci, Cliff Hillis and more.\n\n\"It really is amazing how much talent there is out there,\" he says.\n\nMudrock has watched local musicians grow from 22-year-old novices to 42-year old veterans. In some cases, he's done sound for bands that feature the sons of musicians he did sound for years ago.\n\nAnd he's seen it all – even a keyboard player \"strip down to his BVDs\" during a show.\n\n\"He wanted to make everybody comfortable. He told the crowd, 'If I can do this and be comfortable, then you guys should feel comfortable, too,\" Mudrock remembers. (And, yes, it worked.)\n\nThe shows at the Logan House are not always contained to the stage. A female customer became the center of attention one St. Patrick's Day weekend because she passed out near the stage. The show stopped, an ambulance arrived and she was wheeled out. But not before awakening and telling the hushed crowd, \"I'm fine. I'll be back tomorrow.\"\n\nAdds Mudrock, who lives in Bear: \"The Irish are dedicated to their music.\"\n\nWith Mudrock exiting, Michael P. Kelly, owner of the bar that has been in his family since 1889, tipped his cap to the veteran LoHo soundman.\n\n“We will sorely miss DDD (Digital Dave Da’man),\" Kelly says. \"I have seen nobody better in Delaware. He is a real pro with a gifted ear. He can even make me sound good.\"\n\nAnd the goodbyes aren't stopping. When Mudrock stepped down, Logan House bartender Dave Perritt became the newest name atop the LoHo seniority list, having worked there 19 years.\n\nBut the drink-slinger and guitarist for punk band March of the Mongolian Deathwvrm had also previously decided it was time for his own personal last call. He will serve his final drinks Saturday night.\n\nUp until a few years ago, Mudrock would control the sound from the back of the upstairs room, but he was moved right next to the stage by the rear exit during a remodeling.\n\nIt was there where you could count on seeing the bespectacled soundman on his perch, behind a small wooden fence they built around his equipment.\n\nIf you've seen the old Tim Allen sitcom \"Home Improvement,\" he looked like the neighbor Wilson peeking from atop a fence. And when something would go wrong on stage, you'd see him pop out of his booth and hop onstage to make a quick fix.\n\nBut the shows were never about him. He was always in the background, almost part of the furniture of the bar, which the Kelly family has owned since 1889.\n\n\"I liked staying out of the limelight and being as stealthy as possible,\" he says. \"From an audience perspective, I want them to think everything was being delivered by the band, even if my finger was on the scale a little bit.\"\n\nLogan House general manager Joe Mujica says Kennett Square-based Audiofirm will take out the sound duties.\n\nNot only was Mudrock the party-starter (even though looks more like an IT guy than a rock'n' roller), he was also the party pooper.\n\nWhen 1 a.m. rolled around, it was his job to turn up the lights and make sure band stops playing.\n\nHe was usually successful.\n\nOnly a few bands, such as Montana Wildaxe, could get away with stretching a show too long. One night the jam band told him they only had one song left and then it went on for 20 minutes. Music fans got 20 extra minutes of Grateful Dead tunes that night.\n\nMudrock's other role at the Logan House was to absorb the grumbling from bands who have to load their gear in and out of the 153-year-old tavern in the Forty Acres neighborhood.\n\nLoad-ins go through the rear exit, meaning hauling equipment up and down a steep metal fire escape that can be a real bear if it's raining or snowing.\n\nHe's heard all the complaints and when someone asks if the bar will ever get an elevator, he always had the same answer: \"This building was built when Abraham Lincoln was president. If they haven't done it by now, it's probably not going to happen.\"\n\nThis weekend, Mudrock will find himself in a position he hasn't been in for more than 20 years – with a weekend off.\n\nInstead of blaring rock music and beer-stained floors, he went down to Bethesda, Maryland to visit his son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter and start the next – and much quieter – chapter of his life.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

Then there are screams, as the sound of gunfire rang out. The video also shows police cars.\n\nThe Wilmington Halloween Loop included 10 nightspots throughout the city Saturday night into early Sunday, including four in Trolley Square. Participants could purchase wristbands which offered admission to each of the Loop venues.\n\nThe event regularly draws thousands of people and has been a staple on the city's nightlife calendar for decades.\n\nJerry DuPhily, the publisher of Out & About magazine, the event's organizer, said it's too soon to know what will happen with the Halloween Loop going forward. He said he will have to convene a meeting of bar owners, police and city officials to determine the event's future.\n\n\"The Halloween Loop is a 39-year-old tradition in our city,\" he said in an email. \"It’s helped showcase Wilmington’s nightlife, bring visitors to town, and provide city bars and restaurants with a much-needed revenue boost.\n\n\"It’s beyond disappointing that after nearly 40 years, we have gunshots outside a venue after closing.

He knew he was close, but didn't realize how close.\n\nAfter he moved a few feet away, standing in front of the man now charged in connection with the incident, he watched as Logan House security immediately swarmed New Castle resident Tyler Vega.\n\n\"Yo, one of ya'll did it,\" a member of the security team said while rushing the area.\n\n\"Not me,\" the attorney says in the video, which starts with the sound of the final gunshot. \"I don't have a gun.\"\n\nSoon, Vega was on the ground thanks to the quick action of the bar's 15-member security team working that night, soon followed by police. Bar security also fought off other men who began pulling bouncers off Vega.\n\nAfterward, the attorney looked down to find bullet casings at his feet.\n\nNo one was injured by the gunfire and Vega, 25, was charged with possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and six other gun violations, including possession of a firearm by a person prohibited.\n\nThe witness said he was more confused than scared when the gunshots rang out and thanked the bar's security for quickly subduing the man now sitting in prison on $100,000 cash bail.\n\n\"I want to thank that bouncer.

He wasn't looking in my direction, so I knew he didn't see me coming. If the gun was waving around or pointed at people, I probably would have run the other way,\" said the man, who didn't want to be identified due to threats.\n\nHe soon had Vega on the ground and an on-duty security worker joined in the apprehension. That bouncer also did not want to be identified due to threats made on social media.\n\nHe told The News Journal that a friend of Vega's was fighting and surrounded by security when the gun fired only a few feet away from them.\n\nHe said Vega was under the awning near the building when the shots were fired, adding that Vega then tried to jump a small fence onto the patio before the security team took him down.\n\n\"The gun must have have fell out because it was at my foot and I slid it out of the way,\" the bouncer said. \"In the video you can see [Vega's] friends pulling security off the pile. I didn't want one of them to grab the gun and disappear.\"\n\n\"We just wanted to keep everybody safe. My guys did a great job.\"\n\nHe said the Logan House gave police its security footage, which shows the patio and the gunfire.\n\nIn the wake of the gunfire, Logan House resigned from the Halloween Loop.\n\n\"We wish the Halloween Loop all the best, but we will no longer be a part of it,\" Michael P. Kelly, the bar's chief operating officer, wrote in a statement.\n\nJoe Mujica, Logan House's general manager, said he is meeting with his security team this week to determine if there should be any changes made for the future. He says he had 15 bouncers working that night, as well as three barbacks who also work as bouncers on other nights.\n\nHe was at the entrance when the gunshots rang out and saw his team in action, firsthand.\n\n\"They were able to jump on him right away before it could have escalated into anything more,\" Mujica said. \"They went above and beyond to make sure our staff and patrons were all safe. Some people might run in those moments, but they didn't.\"\n\nWhile the Wilmington attorney who was standing next to Vega said he won't attend another Halloween Loop — he hadn't been to one in five years and was only at the Logan House to meet a friend — he added that he isn't scared away from the historic, 154-year-old bar.\n\nPrevious problems\n\nConcerns over the large crowds that descend on Trolley Square for the Halloween Loop are nothing new.\n\n[Reports of gunfire, fighting at closing time on Trolley Square Halloween Loop]\n\n[New Castle man arrested after gunfire, fighting on Trolley Square Halloween Loop]\n\nIn 2014, every Trolley Square-area bar pulled out of Wilmington's Halloween Loop due to concerns about overcrowding and the potential for danger.\n\nThe one-year boycott came after crowds clogged both the bars and the streets, creating an unsettling scene.\n\n\"At times, you kind of felt like you were sitting on top of a volcano waiting for it to erupt,\" Joe McCoy, owner of Catherine Rooney's, one of the neighborhood's biggest and most popular bars, said at the time. \"It wasn't a good feeling.\"\n\nThe volcano erupted four years later across Delaware Avenue at Kelly's Logan House in the Halloween Loop's 39th year.\n\nLast year's Halloween Loop marked a major change in the event's formula.\n\nLoop organizer and Out & About magazine publisher Jerry DuPhily decided to ditch the 14 school buses that crisscrossed the city, bringing revelers to bars in the city's Trolley Square, Riverfront and downtown areas.\n\nLoop-goers received a $3 discount for the rideshare service Lyft instead. After the Loop, organizers said 212 of the 1,500 codes that were distributed were used.\n\nThe decision to get rid of the buses helped \"complete the loop,\" he told The News Journal at the time, adding that even with buses, some of the loop's thousands of bar-hoppers still drove home at the end of the night.\n\n[Buses out, Lyft in for Wilmington's 38th Halloween Loop]\n\n[Loop partiers used only 212 Lyft discounts for Halloween]\n\nAfter the buses were eliminated, DuPhily countered criticism from loop-goers who pronounced that the Halloween Loop was dead by stressing it was the most responsible decision he could make from a safety standpoint.\n\n\"I'm very, very happy with our decision. We tried to make a decision that was a responsible one,\" he said at the time.\n\nDuPhily will now meet with city officials and Wilmington Police to determine the fate of the Halloween Loop, which would turn 40 next year. The event, which dates back to 1979, drew 3,500 people in 2017, a 12 percent decrease from the prior year.\n\nWilmington Mayor Michael Purzycki's deputy chief of staff for policy and communications, John Rago, said in a statement that the city supports the event’s return next year.\n\n“It is very disturbing that one person’s actions can cast doubts on the future of an annual event that has been as popular, well-attended and non-eventful as this one,” he said. “However, what happened over the weekend gives everyone a chance to review the circumstances and determine the best way to move forward.\n\nOnly 10 bars participated in the Halloween Loop this year: Catherine Rooney’s, Chelsea Tavern, Dead Presidents, Ernest & Scott, Gallucio’s Cafe, Grotto Pizza, Kelly’s Logan House, Timothy’s Riverfront, Trolley Square Oyster House and Trolley Tap House.\n\nThe number of participating bars has steadily declined in recent years, from 23 in 2011 to 10 this year, the lowest number in recent memory.\n\nIn 2014, when Trolley Square bars didn't participate, four bars hosted their own smaller scale bar crawl the weekend before the Halloween Loop.\n\nLogan House, Catherine Rooney's, Añejo Mexican Grill and Tequila Bar and Satsuma Asian Kitchen & Bar — now Trolley Square Oyster Bar — were behind the one-time Trolley Square Pub Crawl.\n\nIn 2013, a large police presence, including Wilmington police's Mobile Field Force and state police reinforcements, watched as the line to some clubs stretched down Delaware Avenue. There was a two-hour wait at Kelly's Logan House at one point as about 30 Wilmington police officers and state troopers patrolled the area.\n\nJacqueline Marie Singles, a Wilmington woman who posted video of the fight and gunfire, said she will return to the Logan House in the future, but thinks they should pat-down customers on big event nights to ensure no one gets inside with a gun.\n\n\"Once the shots were fired, I just ran,\" she said. \"It was pretty scary. In such a crowded area, I didn't know if more people had guns.\"\n\nJeanne Kuang contributed to this report. Contact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

With Hepner behind the mic, the band is rounded out by Chris Young (guitar), Scott Vari (bass) and Brandon Townsend (drums).\n\nNow, the rock cover band is headed to Wilmington's Trolley Square for its debut at Kelly's Logan House (1701 Delaware Ave.) armed with hit songs from the past (Sublime, Weezer and Green Day) and current ear-turners by Bruno Mars, The Black Keys and Imagine Dragons, to name a few.\n\nThere is no cover and the music starts at 10 p.m. Saturday. Go to www. facebook.com/RadioHalo Band for details.\n\n— Ryan Cormier\n\nWinter Jam raises temps in Arden\n\nYes, it's cold out and warmer temperatures seem so very far away.\n\nSo why are the organizers of the Shady Grove Music Festival, which is held each spring in Arden, so busy this week?\n\nThe festival is spinning off a trimmed-down, cold-weather version, appropriately named Shady Grove Winter Jam, to be held tonight at Arden's Gild Hall (2126 The Highway) starting at 8.\n\nWilmington-based jam bands Xtra Alltra and Apex Watson will team up with the soulful, horn-fueled funk band Universal Funk Order, which is also based out of Wilmington.\n\nAll three bands performed at an after-show party at The Chelsea in Atlantic City during Phish's three-night run at the Boardwalk Hotel on Halloween weekend. That experience helped lead to the booking of this show in Arden, with an eye on keeping the party going.\n\nTickets cost $10 at the door.\n\n— Ryan Cormier\n\nDancing spectacle at DuPont Theatre\n\nChannel your two left feet into something useful from Tuesday through Jan. 26 when \"Ballroom with a Twist 2\" brings a frenzy of fringe, sequins and Rumba bass to the DuPont Theatre (1007 N. Market St.) in Wilmington.\n\nRiding on the popularity of talent-based reality TV shows like \"American Idol\" and \"So You Think You Can Dance?,\" the show features sizzling dance moves by professional dancers like Derek Hough, Cheryl Burke and Tony Dovolani. Choreographed by \"Dancing With the Stars'\" Emmy-nominated Louis van Amstel, the evening of dancing and singing highlights Samba, Waltz, Foxtrot Quickstep and Jive.\n\nTickets for afternoon and nighttime performances are $35 to $80 each and can be purchased at duppontheatre.com or by calling (302) 656-4401.\n\n— Margie Fishman\n\nSunday funday in Dover with Joe Theismann\n\n\n\nFootball icon Joe Theismann and jazz virtuoso Miles Jaye – known to a wider audience as the cop from the Village People – are both on tap for appearances Sunday at the Fire & Ice Lounge in Dover Downs Hotel & Casino (1131 N. DuPont Highway) in Dover.\n\nFans can meet the former Washington Redskins quarterback-turned-sportscaster after an interview and Q-and-A with Anthony Gargano of Sport Talk Radio WIP. The interview runs from 1:30-2:30 p.m., at which time Theismann will sign autographs until the end of the AFC Championship Playoff game between the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, which starts at 3.\n\nAfter the game, the club turns to a jazz spot with the former Village People cop returning to his jazz roots for a performance at 9 p.m.\n\nJaye has enjoyed a long music career, including hit singles \"Let's Start Love Over\" and \"I've Been a Fool For You.\"\n\nBoth events are free.\n\nFor more information, visit www.doverdowns.com.\n\n— Sarika Jagtiani\n\nClutch draws hard rock fans to Wilmington\n\n\n\nIt's not every night that World Café Live at the Queen (500 N. Market St., Wilmington) has a hard rock band headlining its downstairs stage and even rarer for the show to sell out a week in advance.\n\nBut that's the case with Maryland-based Clutch and the band's show at the Queen tonight at 8.\n\nThe act has gained a loyal following by touring often during its 20-plus year career as Clutch jumped from small labels to Columbia Records before settling down and releasing its albums on its own label, Weathermaker Music. Last year, Clutch released its 10th studio album, \"Earth Rocker.\"\n\nTickets, which had cost $25 to $28, are being sold by ticket brokers for up to $130 a pair.\n\nKingSnake and Crobot are the opening acts.\n\n— Ryan Cormier", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/01/16"}]}

Then, in the wake of the Democratic National Convention, Harris led Trump by 5 percentage points, 48% to 43%. The poll of 1,000 likely voters, taken by landline and cellphone Oct. 14-18, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nHere are some key points from the poll:\n\nBy double digits, voters said Harris hadn't done enough to explain the specific policies she would pursue in office, 57% to 37%. Those who want to hear more include nearly one in four, 23%, of her supporters. In contrast, those surveyed split evenly, 49% yes to 48% no, on whether Trump had done enough to explain his policies. Just 15% of his supporters want to hear more about what he would do.\n\nThe margins of error for the small subsamples of Latinos and Black voters are plus or minus 9 points − a potential shift of up to 18 points one way or the other − and other recent polls show Harris in a stronger position, including a lead among Hispanics.\n\nHarris edges Trump, 46% to 44%, as the candidate who would do a better job in bringing about change − a crucial asset given wide dissatisfaction with the country's direction. She is favored by double digits, 48% to 31%, as the candidate better able to heal the nation's political divisions.\n\nOn issues, here's what the poll said:\n\nHarris holds a 20-point advantage on handling abortion, 56% to 36%, and a 15-point advantage on health care, 54% to 39%.\n\nTrump edges Harris, 49% to 46%, as the candidate who would do a better job in providing strong leadership.\n\nTrump is more trusted to handle the economy, the top concern on voters' minds, by 10 points, 53% to 43%.\n\nTrump is seen as doing a better job on immigration by 51% to 44% and on foreign policy by 51% to 45%.\n\nHarris strong in Delaware\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by the University of Delaware's Center for Political Communication, which surveyed 400 registered voters in Delaware on Sept. 11-19, Harris and other Democrats held a strong lead in Delaware.\n\nHarris leads Trump with a 55.6% share of the vote. Trump received 35.6% of the votes in the survey, and 3.3% went for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump.\n\nOther presidential race indicators\n\nAllan Lichtman, the historian renowned for accurately predicting 9 out of the 10 most recent presidential elections, has shared his prediction for this year's White House race. He forecasts that Harris will win. In a video first reported by The New York Times, Lichtman explained that his prediction is based on a set of thirteen \"keys\" or true-false questions assessing the strength and performance of the incumbent party in the White House.\n\nHarris and Trump are neck-and-neck in the 2024 race for the White House. In a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Harris leads Trump by 1.7 percentage points. It's even closer when it comes to polling averages from the battleground states. Trump leads Harris by 1.1 percentage points in Arizona, for example, and Harris leads Trump by 0.3 percentage points in Wisconsin.\n\nGambling lines are in Trump's favor. As of Oct. 18, Trump's probability of winning topped 61% on Polymarket, a crypto trading platform, for the first time since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Betfair Exchange, the biggest U.K. peer-to-peer betting platform, predicted on its temperature gauge Thursday morning that Trump would likely win.

She was the only Democrat to vote for it.\n\nMoore won her seat in the November election thanks to support from progressive organizations such as the Delaware Working Families Party.\n\nWhile they did endorse Moore during the election, the Delaware Working Families Party does not support the amendment, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nDuring Thursday's debate, Republicans argued that the wage increase would hurt businesses — especially the ones that have already suffered financial loss during the pandemic. Some also raised concerns about how much the increase would cost the state.\n\n\"This is the wrong time,\" said Rep. Ron Gray, R-Selbyville.\n\nDemocrats argue that workers have also suffered from the pandemic and that an increased minimum wage is long overdue.\n\nAccording to an official financial analysis, it would cost the state an extra $3.7 million per year by 2024 to increase wages for low-paid public employees. The analysis does not project costs for 2025 when the minimum wage would reach $15.\n\nCarney is expected to sign the bill, according to his spokesman Jonathan Starkey.\n\n\"The Governor supports a $15 minimum wage and looks forward to a bill getting to his desk,\" Starkey said.\n\nA week ago, the General Assembly passed a bill — almost entirely along party lines — to erase a 3-year-old law that lets businesses pay young and new workers 50 cents per hour less than the minimum wage. Carney has yet to sign it.\n\nLawmakers are in session until June 30. After that, they go on a six-month break.\n\nEND OF YOUTH, TRAINING WAGE:Democrats move to end law that lets businesses pay younger, newer workers lower wages\n\nTOP OFFICIALS GET PAY RAISES:Why Delaware is giving $20,000 and higher pay hikes to top officials making over $100K\n\nSarah Gamard covers government and politics for Delaware Online/The News Journal.

But for many families, including the family of former geriatric nurse Mary Claudia Jones Barthelmeh, it can lead to little recourse.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:She was a geriatric nurse. Why did it take Delaware so long to realize she was neglected?\n\nAssisted living facilities have no federal oversight, which means it is up to states to serve as a watchdog.\n\nThe Division of Health Care Quality, as of March, had 1,474 complaints for nursing homes and assisted living facilities in its backlog. Data analyzed by The News Journal shows that since 2013, assisted living complaints are overall often investigated less than nursing homes.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2021, an average of about 22% of the assisted living complaints filed were investigated by the state each year. Nursing home complaints, in comparison, had an average investigation rate of about 49% in that time period.\n\nThe state has chronically struggled with hiring and retaining staff to investigate these facilities, in part because of low salaries. The division has asked for additional funding in recent years but has been repeatedly denied by the governor’s office.\n\nNot enough employees to investigate\n\nHealth Secretary Molly Magarik acknowledged at a February budget hearing that the state does not have enough employees to investigate complaints. As a result, the state is also not in federal compliance.\n\n“We're doing what we can to meet as much of the federal requirements as possible and then having very candid conversations with the federal government about where we are,” she said.\n\n“Part of what we're hearing back is: ‘Delaware is not alone in this crisis.’”\n\nWant to share your story?\n\nThe General Assembly’s long-term care and memory care task force is planning to have a public meeting from 5 to 7 p.m. on April 20.\n\nThe group, which mostly consists of lawmakers and people from the health care industry, has been meeting for a few months now. It was a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which showed how understaffed long-term care facilities are in Delaware.\n\nCaregivers are advocating to improve dementia care in Delaware, particularly in assisted living facilities. They are looking for the state to update regulations to require better training and care for these residents.\n\nThe April 20 meeting will be virtual. You can register here.

Homebuyers in the 1980s were ...", "text": "Think mortgage rates are high now? Connie Strait remembers when she was starting her career in real estate in the early 1980s and buyers were contending with rates three times higher.\n\nStrait recalled one couple who were actually relieved when they locked in a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 19% in September 1981. The couple had told her they were hoping to close on their new home before rates moved any higher.\n\n“They were so delighted to be closing at 19%,” said Strait, who now works at William Raveis Real Estate in Danbury, Connecticut. “They said, ‘We made it in just under the wire, next week it is going to 20%!’”\n\nThe following month, in October 1981, the average weekly interest rate for a 30-year, fixed rate loan hit an all-time high of 18.6%, according to Freddie Mac. The average mortgage rate is based on a survey of conventional home purchase loans for borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. But many buyers pay even more.\n\nThis week, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate hit an average of 6.70%. Although it may come as cold comfort to someone who let a 3% rate slip through their fingers just seven months ago, today’s interest rates are, historically speaking, still relatively low.\n\n“Unfortunately, now people don’t remember how Baby Boomers were getting rates of 10%, 12% and higher for most of the 1980s,” Strait said. “Meanwhile, our kids are shocked by 6%.”\n\nThose ultra-high rates made homeownership less affordable in the early 1980s than it is now. By the mid-1980s though, mortgage rates had fallen somewhat, making financing more affordable, even with rates near 10%.\n\nBut many things have changed since the 1980s.\n\nGiven wage growth, sky-high home prices and rapidly rising interest rates, homes today are the least affordable they have been in 35 years.\n\nHome affordability has worsened\n\nMortgage rates were high in the 1980s, but home prices were a lot less expensive, too.\n\nIn October 1981 a typical home cost $70,398. But with mortgage rates averaging 18.45% that month, the $870 monthly payment took up about 55% of the median income at the time, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n\nBy October 1986, rates had dropped to 9.97% and a typical home was $91,488. That brought the monthly payment down to $640, and took up just 30% of the median income.\n\n“If you reduce interest rates by 8.5% that doubles your buying power,” said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research at Black Knight.\n\nWith the typical home currently costing $434,978, and rates over 6%, the monthly mortgage payment of $2,061 eats up more than 36% of the median monthly income, according to Black Knight.\n\n“When we lower interest rates it allows home prices to grow much more quickly than incomes,” said Walden. “It gives folks the ability to buy more home with the same amount of income. So a 1% decline in interest rates allows you to buy 10% to 12% more home, with the exact same amount of money.”\n\nInterest rates have been below 5% for the past 11 years, with the weekly average reaching an all-time low of 2.65% in January 2021. That’s part of the reason why home prices are so high today.\n\nIncomes aren’t keeping up\n\nMaking affordability matters worse, home prices are significantly out of whack with income levels.\n\nOver the past five years, while the average home price has gone up 60%, the average income has risen less than 15%.\n\n“We now have the highest ratio of home price to income that we’ve seen in the past 50 years plus,” said Walden. “We have data going back to 1970 and it is the highest we’ve seen by far.”\n\nHistorically, home prices were between three to four times the median income, a ratio that remained consistent from 1975 until 2000, according to Black Knight. In 2000, as interest rates began to drop below 8%, the ratio began to rise, reaching a point in 2005 where home prices were almost five and a half times the median income.\n\nThe sharp rise in 2005 was largely fueled by expanded credit in the mortgage market, said Walden, with mortgages being offered based on a buyer’s unverified income, and through products like interest-only, adjustable-rate and negative amortizing loans.\n\n“That allowed those shopping to buy more home than their income level would traditionally support,” he said. It also created a bubble that led to the 2008 housing crash.\n\nToday, the typical home price is six times the median household income of about $71,000.\n\nCredit availability has greatly increased\n\nAnother reason why rates were so high in the 1980s was that there was less credit available to borrow, making it more difficult and costly for buyers to secure a mortgage. Banks had to charge higher rates for taking on the risk. But today’s mortgages are often bundled and sold into investment products. That secondary market makes it profitable for lenders to give loans to many more people, and at lower interest rates.\n\n“Back in the early 1980s, rates were in the mid- to upper-teens,” said Pete Miller, senior vice president for residential policy at the Mortgage Bankers Association. “Part of the reason was that the supply of mortgage credit was more constrained. We didn’t have the secondary market liquidity we have today.”\n\nMiller – who bought his first home in California in the mid 1980s with a 13% adjustable rate mortgage – said 6% for a fixed-rate 30-year loan is historically a very good interest rate.\n\n“I remember when interest rates went to single digits and saying, ‘I thought that would never happen.’”", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}

A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey confirmed the state signed a contract with Caddell Construction Co., effective April 15, for construction of a specialized men’s prison facility in Elmore County “that will provide enhanced medical and mental health services.” “The new facility will create a safer security environment for inmates and security personnel. Our construction timeline continues to remain on schedule,” Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, wrote in an email. The Alabama Department of Corrections on Wednesday declined to release a copy of the contract. A spokeswoman said it needed to be redacted, and that would take some time because it is a lengthy contract. The department did not immediately respond to an email seeking information about the cost or the size of the prison. Ivey’s office indicated the prison system should be be able to provide a copy of the “publicly available contract documents in the coming days.” Lawmakers and the governor approved a construction plan that also includes another prison with at least 4,000 beds in Escambia County, a new women’s prison, and renovations to existing facilities.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Some local officials have raised concerns about militarization of the police force after learning of the police department’s plans to buy an armored security vehicle that can seat 12 officers. Some have referred to the vehicle as a tank and said they worry it could harm a transparent relationship between police and the community. Police counter that the vehicle is a way to help protect officers, especially when dealing with people firing weapons, the Juneau Empire reports. “There’s a policy question here about militarizing our police force, and I don’t agree with that,” City and Borough of Juneau Assembly member Carole Triem said. “I think we’ve heard from the community that they really desire transparency when it comes to operations.” Triem raised the issue late at Monday’s assembly meeting, where she also objected to the police department’s ability to buy the vehicle with a grant that doesn’t require assembly approval. The Lenco Armored Vehicle BearCat G3 will cost more than $300,000 when custom-built to Juneau police department specifications, Lt. Krag Campbell said. Campbell said that despite some in the community describing the vehicle as a “tank,” it’s not a military vehicle. “Generally, it’s for our emergency response teams and our fire department,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Electric companies won’t have to worry about competing for customers after Gov. Doug Ducey signed a bill Tuesday that repeals laws allowing for that. His action ends more than 20 years of the state flirting with the idea of customers choosing their power company but never really offering people that choice. Utilities in Arizona supported the legislation because they said allowing competitors to enter the market would threaten the reliability of the power grid as various companies tried to forecast how much power their customers needed. Ducey said competition is a “critically important policy goal” but echoed those concerns about power-grid reliability in his signing letter. “Arizona will not follow the path of California, Texas and other states that have mismanaged their grids and continually experience rolling brownouts and blackouts,” Ducey said in a statement on the bill. Officials at Green Mountain Energy, a company whose move to compete with Arizona utilities appears to have prompted the legislation, said they were disappointed in the governor’s actions. “It is unfortunate that Arizona’s law that would have created competition in the electricity industry, which has been on its books for two decades, has never been implemented,” Green Mountain Vice President Mark Parsons said in a statement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is suing Family Dollar over the discovery of more than 1,000 rodents in a distribution facility that prompted the discount retail chain to recall items purchased from hundreds of stores in the South. The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge in state court, accuses the chain and parent company Dollar General of deceiving consumers, negligence and engaging in a conspiracy that allowed the infestation at the West Memphis facility to occur. “This misconduct by Family Dollar Stores and Dollar Tree allowed them to maximize profits, while causing Arkansas citizens to purchase hazardous, adulterated and contaminated products,” the lawsuit said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced in February that it had inspected the distribution facility following a consumer complaint. Inside the building, inspectors said they found live rodents, dead rodents in “various states of decay,” rodent feces, dead birds and bird droppings. A Dollar Tree spokesman did not immediately return messages seeking comment Thursday. According to the lawsuit, state and federal inspections show Family Dollar had known of the rodent infestation at its facility since at least January 2020.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: People who get hurt because of a doctor’s negligence could soon get a lot more money in malpractice lawsuits under an agreement reached Wednesday that – if approved by the Legislature – would avoid a costly fight at the ballot box this November while resolving one of the state’s longest-running political battles. California does not limit how much money patients can win in malpractice cases for economic damages, which include things that can be counted such as medical expenses and lost wages. But since 1975, state law has limited how much money patients can win for what can’t be counted – such as pain and suffering – to $250,000. Trial attorneys and patients’ rights groups have tried and failed for decades to raise that limit, noting it sometimes costs more than that to take one of these complex lawsuits to trial. Doctors have usually opposed raising the limits, saying it would result in soaring malpractice insurance premiums that could put some community health clinics out of business. With neither side budging, California voters were set to settle the issue in November. But supporters of raising the limit agreed to withdraw the measure from the November ballot Wednesday, instead supporting a new bill in the Legislature that would gradually increase the limit over the next 10 years. The bill has the support of the California Medical Association, the Consumer Attorneys of California, Californians Allied for Patient Protection, state legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nColorado\n\nCanon City: An outbreak of an undetermined and highly contagious disease has killed dozens of wild horses at a federal holding facility in southern Colorado. Bureau of Land Management officials say 67 horses have died since the outbreak began Saturday at the agency’s holding pen in Canon City, about 150 miles southwest of Denver. “We are working with local, state and federal officials to determine what is impacting horses in the facility and how we can respond as effectively as possible,” said Stephen Leonard, the manager of the BLM Colorado Wild Horse and Burro Program. The facility, which is under voluntary quarantine, currently holds 2,550 horses. BLM officials say the horses that have been most affected by the disease were gathered from the West Douglas area last fall. No other information has been released.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Broad agreement has been reached on a revised one-year state budget proposal, Gov. Ned Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly announced Wednesday. The $24.2 billion plan, set to take effect July 1 in the midst of the election season, would see nearly $500 million in tax reductions including the continuation of the 25-cent-per-gallon gas tax cut until Dec. 1, lawmakers said. It also includes substantial new spending for mental health programs for children and early childhood programs, which have struggled to pay workers competitive wages while ensuring services are affordable to families. And the proposal makes $2 billion in payments to help reduce state pension debt, according to the legislators, who have yet to release any documents. Lamont and the Democrats haven’t settled how much of the state’s share of federal COVID-19 funds will be spent in this budget, including how much of that money will be set aside for pandemic pay for essential workers and to reduce the $493 million debt in the state’s unemployment trust fund. But they expressed confidence the budget will be approved before the legislative session ends May 4. Democrats said they were hopeful that at least some Republicans, the minority in the Assembly, will support the proposal.\n\nDelaware\n\nBear: Sixteen years ago after Jason McKenry’s 2-year-old gray tabby escaped from his apartment, he got a text: Ritz had been taken to a veterinarian and was about to be put down when someone found a microchip. Little is known of the cat’s whereabouts after that day in Bear, though McKenry did learn that Ritz had hitched a ride in a neighbor’s pickup truck after charging out of the apartment. For the past couple of years, Ritz has been surviving thanks to the kindness of strangers near Lums Pond. One of those strangers took the cat to the vet and started the chain of events that led to McKenry and Ritz being reunited. But everything in between is a mystery. “I wish he could talk,” McKenry said this week. “I’d love to hear his story.” Everyone connected to the cat, from those who were feeding him to the makers of the microchip, is stunned by the story. “Sixteen years? That’s a new record as far as I know,” said Tom Sharp, president of AKC Reunite, a national database for microchipped pets. “That’s amazing.” Sharp said he expects shelters and veterinarians to check for microchips on animals when they are taken in or before they are adopted out. These microchips, known as radio frequency identification, are not able to locate or trace a pet’s whereabouts because they don’t have GPS.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents in the Southeast neighborhood are being warned after a turkey was seen disrupting bike riders and hikers on a nearby trail, WUSA-TV reports. Late last week, the Department of Energy and Environment, National Park Service, Humane Rescue Alliance and Maryland Department of National Resources were first alerted to an aggressive turkey attacking residents on the Anacostia Riverwalk Trail. Wildlife officials said they had received multiple reports of turkeys attacking people in the district. According to DOEE, it’s turkey breeding season, and the rise in attacks is related to territorial behavior. One of the latest encounters was caught on video by local go-go musician DeDe Folarin of Rare Essence, who was riding his bike on the trail April 12. “All of a sudden, I was coming around the bend, and this big wild turkey just jumps up and almost claws me in the face,” he said. Folarin said he dismounted his bike while the turkey continued to harass him for nearly five minutes. The large bird then turned its attention to another passing cyclist as Folarian captured video of the encounter. “After the lady asked if I could help, I picked up a stick, and I kind of whacked the turkey, and he kind of ran back into the brush, and that was it,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A judge on Wednesday vacated the life sentence of a 55-year-old Black man who prosecutors said was wrongfully convicted because of mistaken identity in 1991. “I feel good. Real good,” Thomas “Jay” Raynard James said Wednesday as he left a Miami courtroom with his attorneys and family members. James was convicted of the 1990 death of Francis McKinnon, largely on identification by an eyewitness who told jurors she watched him gun down her stepfather during a robbery in his Coconut Grove apartment. Earlier Wednesday, James, wearing his red prison uniform and shackles, stood behind his mother, Doris Strong, as Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle detailed a 90-page motion her office filed asking for the conviction to be vacated. “Mom, hopefully the court will grant you the freedom you’ve been looking for for so many years,” Fernandez Rundle told Strong, who sobbed quietly throughout the news conference. James was 23 when he was convicted. Over the past year, Fernandez Rundle said, members of her office’s Justice Project poured over 20,000 pages of documents, reinterviewed witnesses, resubmitted fingerprints and retested DNA samples. In a 90-page motion to vacate the conviction, prosecutors said that “what appears to be a chance coincidence that the defendant, Thomas Raynard James, had the same name as a suspect named by witnesses and anonymous tipsters … led to the defendant’s photograph being included in a lineup, and set in motion a mistaken identity.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Morris Brown College has regained full accreditation after a 20-year journey that its leaders hope will ultimately prompt higher enrollment. The Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools voted Tuesday to grant the liberal arts college full accreditation status, meaning its students can apply for federal loans and Pell grants, the association confirmed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools revoked Morris Brown’s accreditation in 2002 after a former college president and financial aid director were found to be misappropriating federal funds and rising debt. “Morris Brown College just made history,” President Kevin James told the newspaper. “We’re excited about it. A lot of people had written us off. But due to a lot of hard work and dedication, we were able to regain our accreditation.” Morris Brown sought accreditation from TRACS, which also approved reaccreditation to another HBCU in Georgia: Paine College in Augusta. James, Morris Brown’s leader since 2019, called the process “the hard reset.” The historically Black college planned to formally announce the reaccreditation Thursday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s top public health officials said Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic is still active but is moving into a new phase of the disease, in which people can test themselves at home and ideally avoid serious illness thanks to vaccination and the use of therapeutic treatments. Gov. David Ige described the change as a transition from “emergency response” to “public health management.” He said at a news conference that state officials would be handling COVID-19 more similarly to other diseases. The adjustment has been underway for a few months, said Dr. Libby Char, the director of the state Department of Health. One example is how the state uses contact tracers. “We’ve seen a shift from trying to track down every single case and all of their contacts to instead getting the message out so that we all have our own personal COVID-19 preparedness plan,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the state’s epidemiologist. Part of that change is possible because home test kits are now widely available. But another reason is that universal contact tracing isn’t the best method to control an airborne disease like COVID-19, she said. People can follow self-isolation guidelines and notify those with whom they’ve been in contact about their exposure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Jurors have begun deliberating in the rape trial of a former state lawmaker accused of sexually assaulting a legislative intern last year. Prosecutors and the defense attorney for Aaron von Ehlinger made their final arguments to the jury late Thursday morning, moments after von Ehlinger gave his own recounting of the events. Von Ehlinger, 39, has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object – both charges carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison – and maintains he had consensual sex with the 19-year-old intern. The Associated Press generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted and has referred to the woman in this case as “Jane Doe” at her request. Doe told her supervisors that von Ehlinger, then a Republican representative from Lewiston, raped her in March 2021 at his Boise apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. Von Ehlinger resigned from the House of Representatives last year after a legislative ethics committee recommended he be banned from the Statehouse because of his conduct with Doe. Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told jurors the case was about “power in the wrong hands” used to the “great devastation” of Doe. Von Ehlinger had social, political and physical power over the petite intern, Farley said.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed four pieces of legislation into law Wednesday aimed at easing a shortage of teachers and classroom aides in public schools. The new laws lower the fee to reinstate a lapsed teaching certificate, allow student teaching by college seniors, lower the minimum age for classroom aides, and extend the number of days in a row a short-term substitute can spend in one classroom if a disaster is declared. Pritzker signed the bills during a ceremony at Springfield High School, just two blocks from the Capitol. The Illinois State Board of Education estimates there will be about 4,120 openings in public schools this fall. That includes 1,700 teachers and 1,240 paraprofessionals, who are qualified but unlicensed educators who help teachers. It’s not a new situation and predates the COVID-19 pandemic. But the coronavirus, which forced schools into a roller coaster of openings and closings, scheduling and staffing, worsened matters. Several lawmakers have been focused on getting classrooms staffed with qualified people. Rep. Sue Scherer, a Decatur Democrat and former teacher, said a retired teacher who is a constituent wanted to help out because of the crisis before learning it would cost him $500 to reinstate his license. Scherer’s legislation, run through the Senate by Meg Loughran Cappel, D-Shorewood, lowers that fee to $50 immediately.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafeyette: Purdue University and Duke Energy plan to jointly explore the feasibility of using advanced nuclear energy to meet the campus’s long-term energy needs and reduce its carbon footprint, they announced Wednesday. Purdue and Duke intend to study power produced through small modular reactors, which are significantly smaller than traditional nuclear power plants. An SMR could meet current and future needs for the West Lafayette campus and provide excess power to the state’s electric grid. SMRs can be prefabricated off site, saving money and time in construction. “No other option holds as much potential to provide reliable, adequate electric power with zero carbon emissions,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said. However, nuclear power plants use large amounts of water for steam production and cooling. They also produce spent uranium fuel, which is stored in pools or steel-lined concrete vaults for decades. Purdue provided no time line on when its first SMR might arrive on campus. Duke said it is the largest regulated nuclear plant operator in the nation, with 11 nuclear units at six plant sites in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Bureau of Refugee Services says it is seeking families to become official sponsors of Ukrainian refugees who may be coming to Iowa under a new federal program. In a news release, the bureau said it plans to assist families with webinars and training sessions to help sponsors understand what resettlement entails, what their duties and responsibilities will be, and the resources available to help them. The news release did not say how many Ukrainians are likely to come to Iowa or what plans are being made to deal with those Ukrainians after Afghan refugees who began arriving in the Des Moines metro late last year told reporters they’ve struggled without sufficient long-term housing, food and other assistance. While the bureau said it stands ready to help prospective sponsors, they also can apply directly through the federal program at welcome.us. But Des Moines Refugee Support, a nonprofit that has been working closely with Afghan refugees, said in a statement Wednesday that volunteers would love to welcome Ukrainians, but Des Moines is not ready to take them. “We are worried about the logistics, as we have many Afghan families still in hotels, Afghans still needing food assistance, Afghan babies without diapers,” the statement said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state saw a 4.1% increase in the number of abortions performed in 2021 compared with 2020, with more Missouri residents but fewer Oklahoma and Texas residents coming into Kansas to terminate pregnancies. A preliminary report Tuesday from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showed that 7,849 abortions were performed in the state last year. That’s 303 more than the 7,546 performed in Kansas in 2020. The state saw an increase of more than 9% in the number of abortions performed in 2020 over 2019, due to an influx of patients from Oklahoma and Texas, where Republican governors shut down providers early in the coronavirus pandemic, while Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, kept them open. But the number of abortions performed in Kansas for women from Oklahoma and Texas dropped to a total of 370 in 2021 from 566 in 2020, a decline of nearly 35%. Meanwhile, the number of abortions for women from Missouri was 3,458 last year, up 8% or 257 from 2020. And 8% more Kansas residents had abortions in the state in 2021 than in 2020. The increase was 292, making the total 3,937.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A long-controversial proposal for a pipeline that would snake through Bullitt County and a beloved arboretum is being sent back to the drawing board after a vital permit for the project was suspended. After several conservation groups threatened to sue to prevent Louisville Gas & Electric from building the natural gas pipeline, which would cut through some property owned by Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to review how the project could affect three bat species protected by the Endangered Species Act that live in the region. Construction on the 12-mile pipeline has not yet started and, under the new ruling, will not be able to begin until the two agencies ensure the species – Indiana bats, gray bats and northern long-eared bats – are not put at risk. The contested project has been in the works for years, sparking outcry from environmental advocates and others in the community since it was first proposed in 2015. “Save Bernheim Forest” yard signs are a common sight around Louisville among homeowners concerned about the proposed pipeline’s potential impact on the popular 16,000-acre wildlife sanctuary just south of the city.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A bill to outlaw spanking and all other forms of corporal punishment in the state’s public schools cleared its first hurdle Wednesday as lawmakers determine whether hitting children in schools is an appropriate form of discipline or abuse. The Louisiana House Education Committee advanced Metairie Republican Rep. Stephanie Hilferty’s House Bill 649 without objection. “We don’t allow juveniles in our detention centers or (inmates) in our prisons to be hit; I’m asking for the same treatment for our children while they’re in school,” Hilferty said while testifying for her bill. An identical bill in 2021 by Hilferty made it to the House floor, where it was defeated on a 48-49 vote. Louisiana is one of 19 states that still allows corporal punishment in public schools. Among the others are neighbors Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas. Fellow Metairie Republican Rep. Laurie Schlegel made the motion to approve Hilferty’s legislation. “I was shocked that this is still a thing,” Schlegel said. Louisiana Partnership for Children and Families executive director Susan East Nelson, who has previously described corporal punishment as “state-sponsored child abuse,” testified again in favor of banning the practice. “This has been a priority for us for 10 years,” Nelson said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A hunting group is suing the state to overturn its long-standing ban on Sunday hunting. Hunting bear, moose, wild turkey and deer is popular in Maine, but the state has barred Sunday hunting for generations. Opponents of the ban filed their lawsuit Wednesday with a claim that the law violates the state’s new “Right to Food” amendment. Maine voters passed the nation’s first such constitutional amendment last year. The amendment states that individuals have a right to harvest food of their own choosing. The opponents of the Sunday hunting ban said in a statement that Maine’s long-standing ban “was created based on the religious and social beliefs at the time, not biology or science.” But the ban has withstood challenges in the past. The Legislature’s Committee on Inland Fisheries and Wildlife voted against a proposal to end the ban in March. The Maine Professional Guides Association, which represents guides who assist hunters, was among the groups that opposed the change. The only other state that bans Sunday hunting is Massachusetts.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints U.S. currency, is moving forward with plans to build its new facility in Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Wednesday. The bureau is expecting to house at least 850 workers on site, with 600 additional employees working remotely, the governor’s office said. The 104-acre site, located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Prince George’s County, has been officially transferred to the Department of the Treasury. It will house a new state-of-the-art and environmentally conscious production facility to print U.S. paper currency and other federal security products. “Over the past three years, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the state of Maryland have worked closely on evaluating the potential for this Beltsville facility and determining how we can best work together to make this project successful,” Hogan said in a statement. The bureau is in the design stage of the project and plans to wrap up design development by summer 2023. Construction of the new facility, which is being managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Baltimore District, is anticipated to be completed by early 2027, with currency production starting midyear.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former transit police officer has pleaded guilty to assaulting and violating the civil rights of a 63-year-old man who refused to get off a bus last year but has avoided jail and could eventually have the charges dismissed. Prosecutors on Wednesday asked a Superior Court judge to sentence Nicholas Morrissey to a one-year suspended sentence with three years of probation, according to a statement Thursday from the Suffolk district attorney’s office. The judge, citing Morrissey’s military service and the fact he resigned, continued the case for an 18-month probationary period. That means charges could be dismissed if Morrissey complies with the terms of probation. He is also not allowed to seek another job in law enforcement. “The actions of one officer can sow seeds of distrust in our entire system,” Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I’m grateful to the Transit Police Department for their immediate actions to hold a member of their own ranks accountable and to ensure the wellbeing of the public they serve.” Morrissey’s attorney said his client is a Marine Corps veteran who had no prior disciplinary problems. “I think it was a fair disposition,” Robert Jubinville said. “This fellow had been on the job for 13 years and had never had any issues.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man in prison for 15 years for kidnapping and sexual assault was cleared of the crimes Wednesday after authorities discovered many mistakes, including a failure to disclose DNA results proving his innocence. “There were so many things missed along the way,” said Valerie Newman of the Wayne County prosecutor’s office, who reviews Detroit-area cases that can turn out to be wrongful convictions. Judge Kelly Ramsey approved a request to erase Terance Calhoun’s convictions in two cases from 2006 and immediately release him from prison. His earliest parole date would have been November 2023. Calhoun, 35, declined to speak during the court hearing, which was held by video conference, but wore a big smile when lawyers Tabitha Harris and Michael Mittlestat congratulated him. “Good luck to you,” the judge said. In 2007, Calhoun pleaded no contest to kidnapping and other charges and was sentenced to at least 17 years in prison. He was accused of targeting two teen girls in Detroit in 2006. But a few months after Calhoun was sent to prison, tests revealed a condom linked to an assault on the second victim had ruled him out as the perpetrator. There is no indication the DNA results were given to his lawyer, Newman said. She also noted that a description of the attacker as a man with braids and a puzzle tattoo didn’t fit Calhoun.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Legislative leaders announced a deal Thursday to refill the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund and to pay bonuses to front-line workers, resolving a months­long impasse. The tentative agreement includes $2.7 billion to replenish the trust fund and pay back a debt to the federal government for jobless aid, as well as $500 million in bonuses for workers who took risks during the pandemic. House Democrats came down from their $1 billion proposal for bonus checks, cutting the amount per worker in half to $750 but keeping eligibility at about 667,000 workers. The proposal – which would spend all of Minnesota’s remaining federal pandemic relief funds of more than $1 billion – also includes $190 million for a pandemic response account to support efforts that are already ongoing, like the state’s testing apparatus. A House provision making hourly school employees eligible for unemployment insurance during the summer months was cut in the compromise. “We tried to get it done earlier,” said Senate Majority Leader Jeremy Miller, R-Winona, citing the Senate passage of its unemployment insurance bill in February on a bipartisan 55-11 vote. “It took a little bit longer than we’d hoped, but the final deal is a good deal for the people of Minnesota, and we’re happy to get it done.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves has vetoed part of a budget bill for the University of Mississippi Medical Center, saying he objects to spending $50 million for improvements to the adult hospital in Jackson. The Republican governor issued the partial veto of Senate Bill 3010 on Tuesday. Legislators specified the $50 million would come from Mississippi’s pandemic recovery money from the federal government. UMMC declined to comment on the partial veto, spokesperson Marc Rolph said Wednesday. Reeves wrote on Twitter that UMMC’s academic functions – teaching physicians, nurses and other health care professionals – are largely funded by the state, but the hospital is not. “They are responsible for their own operational budget – just like other hospitals,” Reeves wrote. The governor wrote that UMMC receives “competitive advantages” over other hospitals and physician groups because it does not need the Health Department’s approval for new facilities or large equipment. However, UMMC does need approval from the state college board. “There is little reason that Mississippi taxpayers should radically increase the commitment to further subsidize the operations of UMMC to the detriment of competitors,” Reeves wrote. “Furthermore, they currently have enough money to willingly turn away patients on private insurance, clearly indicating that they have no need for the state to underwrite their ambitious building/spending goals.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A divided state Senate narrowly passed legislation Thursday that could allow thousands of elderly, disabled and homeless residents to spend government food stamp benefits at restaurants – something currently allowed in only a handful of states. The bill revealed deep divisions within the Republican-led chamber, where most GOP members voted against what they described as an “expansion of the welfare state” even as Republican leaders joined with Democrats to support it. The measure passed 18-15, receiving the bare minimum to advance to the House with just two weeks remaining in the legislative session. Low-income residents receiving aid from the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program generally must get food at retail locations, such as grocery and convenience stores. But the federal government allows states to enact policies authorizing elderly, disabled and homeless residents to buy food at restaurants that agree to sell meals at lower prices. Some in the conservative caucus claimed their party leaders were violating a core GOP campaign pledge by supporting the legislation and encouraging low-income residents to squander their benefits. Others pushed back, noting the bill doesn’t increase the overall cost of the program but rather offers options for hot meals for people in need. Those who are disabled or elderly might not be able to cook, and people who are homeless don’t have refrigerators to store food or kitchens to prepare it, said Sen. Tony Luetkemeyer, the Republican whip responsible for rallying votes.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new law that requires the state’s attorney general to warn voters if a proposed ballot initiative would hurt businesses does not apply to ballot measures that would amend the state constitution, a state judge has ruled. Wednesday’s decision by District Court Judge Chris Abbott of Helena allows signature gathering to continue for a constitutional initiative that seeks to cap residential property taxes at 1% of the assessed value and limit annual changes in valuations, thus limiting changes in residential property taxes. Market value assessments would be performed when property is sold or significantly improved, under the proposed initiative. The Montana Federation of Public Employees, the Montana Farmers Union, Realtor Jeff Barber, farmer Ron Ostberg and rancher Dennis McDonald argued in a complaint filed in January that Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and Attorney General Austin Knudsen did not meet the requirements of the new law before allowing signatures to be gathered to put Constitutional Initiative 121 on the November 2022 ballot. The state argued and Abbott agreed that the law passed in 2021 applies only to initiatives that seek to change the law, not to change the state constitution. The plaintiffs oppose the ballot initiative because putting a limit on residential property taxes could shift the tax burden to agricultural land and other property and lead to reductions in state services.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Another large case of bird flu at a farm has been confirmed, state and federal agriculture officials said Wednesday. The highly contagious avian influenza was found on a farm in Knox County in northeast Nebraska along the South Dakota border. It is the seventh confirmed case of the disease in the state this year, the Nebraska Department of Agriculture said in a news release. More than 2.1 million laying hens will be euthanized, agriculture officials said. The farm will also be quarantined, and a 6.2-mile control zone will be established. The department also announced that an order prohibiting any type of birds from events such as fairs, expositions, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird auctions has been extended to May 15. It was scheduled to expire Saturday.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A wild coyote howls at the glow of a lamp post in a snowy parking lot. A mustard-yellow recliner is beached in a flooded grove of trees. These images depicting interactions between the human and natural world are part of the Nevada Museum of Art’s Altered Landscape collection and the inspiration behind a new classical composition, “Altered Landscape,” which the Reno Philharmonic will perform May 7-8 at the Pioneer Center for the Performing Arts. In the upcoming performance, the Reno Phil plans to present a composition that will tackle the complexity of climate change and how the pandemic reflected that complexity. “This is a project that sheds both light and hope on one of the most urgent issues of our time: climate change,” said Reno Phil Music Director Laura Jackson. “There is no question that we are in an era where human impact has reached every corner of the earth, and we can no longer take for granted the health and abundance of the natural resources we hold dear.” In 2019, Jackson commissioned Peruvian-born composer Jimmy López Bellido to create a piece of music that would tell a story about climate change. The Reno Phil is approaching orchestras worldwide to perform the symphony in their respective communities. Rather than paying a consortium fee to the Reno group, other orchestras will donate a minimum of $1,000 directly to The Nature Conservancy.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has blocked an attempt to eliminate a registration system put in place years ago to prevent widespread hepatitis C outbreaks. New Hampshire created the Board of Registration for Medical Technicians in response to David Kwiatkowski, who is serving 39 years in prison for replacing painkillers with saline-filled syringes tainted with his blood. Despite being fired numerous times over drug allegations, Kwiatkowski had worked in 18 hospitals in seven states before being hired in at Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire. After his arrest in 2012, 46 people in four states were diagnosed with the same strain of the hepatitis C virus he carries, including one who died in Kansas. The New Hampshire House recently passed a bill that would eliminate the board, with supporters saying it creates unnecessary bureaucracy at a time when health care facilities are struggling to hire workers. But the Senate killed it Thursday, citing the importance of patient safety.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Orsted, the Danish wind power developer, signed an agreement Thursday with New Jersey officials to use a state-financed manufacturing port to build the components of the state’s first offshore wind farm. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the agreement during an international wind energy conference in Atlantic City, from whose coast the project’s turbines should be visible on the distant horizon. Orsted, which is partnering with Newark-based PSEG to build the project, will lease the New Jersey Wind Port in Salem County for two years starting in April 2024. Murphy did not reveal how much the developers will pay for the lease. The parties signed the letter of intent Thursday, but binding agreements are to be submitted to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority by June. The pact marks the first return on the state’s investment of up to $500 million in the wind port, designed to help the state attract companies interested in building wind power projects as New Jersey seeks to become the East Coast hub of the offshore wind industry. “This is a huge moment: Today is a vision turning into reality,” Murphy said at the conference, sponsored by the Business Network for Offshore Wind. “This is truly New Jersey’s ‘if you build it, they will come’ moment.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s K-12 schools should cut staff and think about downsizing the district’s footprint amid dwindling enrollment while spending more for the education of low-income students who fell further behind their peers during this school year, according to a report from the Legislature made public Wednesday. The report from the powerful Legislative Finance Committee recommended Albuquerque Public Schools let go of 400 of the district’s 12,000 employees but didn’t specify how many of the district’s increasingly empty schools it should shutter. The system has 144 schools and 73,000 students, down from 85,000 six years ago. Public schools in New Mexico have not recovered from the exodus of students that accelerated during the pandemic, with enrollment across the state and in Albuquerque still down about 4%, more than the average of 2.6% for 41 U.S. states. Thousands of families in New Mexico amid the pandemic tried home-schooling or charter schools for the first time and didn’t send their kids back to traditional classrooms this year. Despite getting financing federal pandemic relief funds, most school districts across the U.S. now have fewer students and less funding than before the pandemic, forcing educators to consider cutting spending.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s highest court on Wednesday rejected new congressional maps that had widely been seen as favoring Democrats, largely agreeing with Republican voters who argued the district boundaries were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The decision may delay New York’s primary elections by as much as two months and is likely a hammer-blow to Democrats’ national redistricting hopes, which leaned heavily on their ability to gerrymander New York state to maximize the number of seats they could win in the U.S. House of Representatives. The state’s Court of Appeals said the Democratic-led Legislature lacked the authority to redraw congressional and state Senate maps after an independent redistricting commission charged with crafting new maps failed to reach a consensus. The judges also said lawmakers gerrymandered the congressional maps to Democrats’ favor, in violation of a 2014 constitutional amendment designed to rout out political gamesmanship in redistricting. The Appeals Court handed authority to draw new district maps to an expert, known as a special court master, instead of the Legislature. “Prompt judicial intervention is both necessary and appropriate to guarantee the People’s right to a free and fair election,” said the court’s opinion, written by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State residents can now cast ballots in person for the May 17 primary elections. Election boards in all 100 counties opened early voting sites Thursday morning. People who are registered to vote or who apply at a site can cast ballots. Party nominations for the U.S. Senate and House, the Legislature, judicial positions and county offices are at stake. There are also municipal races – many of them officially nonpartisan – in towns and cities where 2021 elections were delayed. The early-voting period continues through the afternoon of May 14. Some counties will have early voting on preceding weekends. An unaffiliated voter can choose to cast ballots in the Democratic or Republican primary but not both. Registered Democrats and Republicans must vote in their party’s primary. People who are already registered have other voting options. They can request a mail-in absentee ballot by May 10, or they can vote in person May 17.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The planned Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in western North Dakota won’t get all the money initially promised from a Walmart heir, but officials say they surpassed its $100 million private fundraising goal anyway. Rob and Melani Walton had pledged $50 million to the project near Medora but wound up committing to $15 million instead, as first reported by KFGO radio. Melani Walton, a Williston native, had been a member of the library’s board but resigned last month. Rob Walton is the eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Both library officials and the Waltons downplayed the diminished donation. “When the history of this remarkable institution is told years from now, Melani and Rob will occupy a significant place in that story,” library foundation CEO Ed O’Keefe told The Bismarck Tribune. “We wish them nothing but the best.” A statement from the Rob and Melani Walton Foundation said the couple “is so pleased to have supported this project from its inception.” Library organizers set the fundraising bar at $100 million in order to access an additional $50 million in state money. O’Keefe declined to say how much money has been raised, citing “the quiet phase of the capital campaign,” but said that “I can assure you it is in excess of $100 million.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Frustrated Democrats took the unusual step Thursday of calling their own political mapmaking hearing of sorts, inviting public testimonials and streaming the proceeding on Facebook. State Sen. Vernon Sykes and House Democratic Leader Allison Russo are both members of the bipartisan Ohio Redistricting Commission, a seven-member panel controlled by Republicans. The commission has not yet reconvened despite facing a May 6 deadline set by the Ohio Supreme Court for fixing its fourth set of invalidated Statehouse maps – though it has set a meeting for May 4, the day after the primary election. Sykes and Russo said their decision to schedule the forum followed their repeated attempts to get the other commissioners to the table, or to convene the panel themselves. Neither strategy worked, they said. The GOP’s casual approach to the deadline follows a key decision last week by a three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which indicated in a separate federal lawsuit that it plans to impose the commission’s third set of legislative maps May 28 if no alternative is passed by then. The state Supreme Court has ruled the third set of maps – like the first, second and fourth – an unconstitutional gerrymander unduly favoring Republicans. “Too bad so sad,” influential Republican state Rep. Bill Seitz, of Cincinnati, said in a Twitter spat with former Ohio Democratic Chair David Pepper over the ruling. “We win again.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state House gave final approval Thursday to a Texas-style abortion ban that prohibits the procedure after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. The bill approved by the GOP-led House on a 68-12 vote without discussion or debate now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who is expected to sign it within days. House members also voted Thursday to adopt new language prohibiting transgender students from using school restrooms that match their current gender identity and requiring parental notification to parents ahead of any classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity. “They’re all concerned about their elections coming up and making sure they have something they can put on a postcard to talk about,” said Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Midwest City. The abortion bill, dubbed the Oklahoma Heartbeat Act, prohibits abortions once cardiac activity can be detected in the fetus, which experts say is roughly six weeks into a pregnancy. A similar bill approved in Texas last year led to a dramatic reduction in the number of abortions performed in that state, sending many women seeking the procedure to Oklahoma and other surrounding states. Although Stitt already signed a bill this year to make performing an abortion a felony crime, it’s not set to take effect until later in the summer and might not withstand a legal challenge.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Court of Appeals on Wednesday overturned a $1.1 billion verdict against the state over its forest management practices, the latest development in a decades­long dispute over the best use of vast tracts of forestland that cover much of the state’s rural areas. A Linn County jury found in 2019 that Oregon breached its contract with 13 rural counties and 151 local taxing districts by failing to maximize timber harvests on state forests over the past two decades. The counties have said Oregon must manage more than 700,000 acres of state forestland for maximum timber revenue, while the state Department of Forestry believes it has the discretion to manage the land for wildlife and recreation. Gov. Kate Brown applauded the reversal and said in a statement that Oregon manages its forests sustainably “not only for the benefit and prosperity of this generation but those to come.” “Today’s decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals is a validation of the fact that a balanced, science-based approach to public forest management will produce the greatest long-term outcomes for all Oregonians, including the counties and taxing districts that receive revenue from state forests,” she said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHonesdale: A candidate in next month’s Republican primary for lieutenant governor was ordered this week to stay away from his home after his wife made claims of physical and mental abuse in obtaining a protective order. Teddy Daniels was accused of making threats, saying he would kill the family dog and grabbing his wife by the shirt. The woman also told a judge Daniels stalked her at work, “screaming at me, making me cry,” and continually cursed at her and threatened to throw her out of the home if he loses his campaign. He has hurled verbal abuse toward their son, she said in a handwritten, three-page petition. He also prevents her from seeing her family and told her she couldn’t attend a family funeral, she wrote. Daniels, 47, is one of nine candidates seeking the GOP nomination in the state’s May 17 primary, running with the endorsement of a leading candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano. Both are vocal supporters of ex-President Donald Trump. Daniels has said he, like Mastriano, was outside the U.S. Capitol during the insurrectionist riot Jan. 6, 2021. Responding to his wife’s accusations, Daniels vowed to stay in the race and claimed without evidence that he was the target of “political terrorism” meant to damage his campaign. A Wayne County judge granted a temporary protection from abuse order to Daniels’ wife Tuesday. Daniels was removed from his home in a gated community in the Poconos. The judge gave Daniels’ wife temporary custody of their child and ordered Daniels to turn over his guns.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee on Thursday pulled out of a planned gubernatorial debate next week as a new online poll showed his popularity has fallen dramatically since last year. McKee was slated to participate in the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council candidate forum May 5 but said Thursday that he won’t do any debates until the election ballot is set at the end of June. “I’ll engage in these debates and forums once everybody signs their name on the line that they are running, and I am going to have to do that as well,” McKee told reporters at a general news briefing Thursday without elaborating on the decision. McKee skipped the first gubernatorial debate in February hosted by the Rhode Island Democratic Women’s Caucus. McKee’s office told RIPEC he is not doing debates last week after twice confirming he would attend, the business-backed fiscal watchdog group said Thursday. The announcement that McKee will not debate his rivals until the summer coincided with the release of an online poll from Morning Consult that found 42% of Rhode Island voters approve of the job he is doing, and 40% disapprove. It’s a big drop in popularity from last year, when Morning Consult found 59% of voters surveyed from July to October approved of the job McKee was doing, and only 25% disapproved.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People who want the state to become the 49th to pass a hate crimes law have explained, bargained and begged Republicans in the state Senate just to hold a debate on the bill. On Wednesday, with just days left before the measure dies, they turned to one of the survivors of one of the most heinous racist attacks in modern America seeking to persuade senators to at least take a vote on the bill. They showed a two-minute video of Polly Sheppard to the Senate chamber, where the bill has been stuck for months, with eight Republicans senators objecting and only eight more legislative days to take action. The racist gunman who killed nine of Sheppard’s church friends in 2015 pointed his gun at the woman but said he would spare her life so she could let the world know he was killing Black people because he hated them. One of the dead from the attack was Sheppard’s pastor, state Sen. Clementa Pinckney, whose portrait hangs in a place of honor in the Senate chamber. “Eight members of the South Carolina Senate are giving a safe haven to hate. Every time you look at senator Pinckney’s photograph, you should be reminded that hate killed him,” Sheppard said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nWatertown: In the wake of a high school teacher handing out a letter that refuted the gender identities of transgender students, some local organizations and businesses are working to provide a safe, supportive community for LGBTQ+ kids. Watertown Love held an event Tuesday night during which students, friends and family could converse in a safe environment. The gathering also provided an opportunity for community members to show their support for those affected by Monday’s incident at Watertown High School, which the school district is investigating. Students received a letter from German teacher Calvin Hillesland saying that when they asked him to call their friends by masculine names, he felt it was “wrong” and “a lie.” First Congregational United Church of Christ in Watertown was one of the community entities that offered support. Pastor Dustin Bartlett provided a letter of his own to the students and all LGBTQ+ individuals who might be struggling with their understanding of God and how religion fits with their sexuality and gender. “I have read the Bible. I have read much of it, including the so-called ‘clobber passages’ that have been used to attack LGBTQ+ people, in the original Hebrew and Greek languages,” he wrote. “I am something of an expert on this question, certainly more so than that of a high school German teacher.

The measure is just one of several proposals introduced in Tennessee this year designed to impose more scrutiny and transparency in school libraries amid a national spike in book challenges and bans. School librarians have become the target of scorn from GOP lawmakers pushing for more oversight on materials provided to children, particularly those that touch on racism and LGBTQ issues. Rep. Jerry Sexton, R-Bean Station, introduced a last-minute amendment this week to a school bill that would give the state’s textbook commission – made up of politically appointed members – veto power over what books end up on school library shelves. Schools would have to provide the commission a list of their library materials. Rep. John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, asked Sexton what he would do with books deemed to be inappropriate. “You going to put them in the street? Light them on fire? Where are they going?” Clemmons asked. “I don’t have a clue, but I would burn them,” Sexton said on the House floor. Later, he amended what he had said on the floor to note that he wasn’t a member of the textbook commission and didn’t think any book-burning was likely to occur.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas officials are warning students to stay away from raccoons on campus after three students were bitten and received rabies vaccinations as a precaution. The UT Office of Campus Safety tweeted Wednesday that the university has seen “an increase of incidents involving raccoons and the UT student population where raccoons may be made bolder due to being fed by humans.” The raccoon in question is believed to be located around the outside of the McCombs School of Business and the Perry-Castañeda Library, and it might feel threatened by close contact, especially if it has offspring nearby, according to the UT Office of Campus Safety. The school said people should be aware of their surroundings in the area and seek medical attention immediately if they are scratched or bitten by a raccoon or any other wildlife. The university also is urging people to not approach raccoons with the intent to feed, pet or take pictures with the animals.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Canyon Overlook Trail, one of the oldest hikes in Zion National Park, is getting a facelift this summer, the park announced. With upgrades like improved trail tread, rehabilitated masonry, and handrails, the more than 5 million annual visitors to the nation’s second-most-popular national park will have an upgraded sight to see. “The (National Park Service) planned this work to protect the trail’s historic, rustic appearance and enhance safety for hikers,” officials said in a press release. The trail will be closed Monday to Thursday each week while work is underway until early June, and though it will be open most Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, there might be intermittent closures on weekends. The Pine Creek canyoneering route and lower Pine Creek Drainage, with sections below the Canyon Overlook Trail, may be closed for short periods to “ensure safety,” the release said. “Canyoneers traveling this route need to be mindful of their surroundings, watch for signs showing closed areas, and be aware that work may be happening above them,” it said. The Canyon Overlook Trail is outside the east end of the Mount Carmel Tunnel and was originally built in the 1930s, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A foundation is working with the state community college system to provide a free, two-year college degree over the next five years. The J. Warren & Lois McClure Foundation announced the “Free Degree Promise through the Early College Program at CCV” on Tuesday for Vermont students in the high school classes of 2022-2026. In addition to providing tuition and fees after any federal and state financial aid, the foundation will provide career and education counseling and stipends to help pay for books, transportation and other college costs. The McClure foundation’s plan builds upon the Community College of Vermont’s Early College program that allows high school seniors to complete their last year of high school and first year of college at the same time. “Young people deserve a degree they can count on and afford,” McClure Foundation President Barbara Benedict said in a statement. “By guaranteeing this pathway through Early College to a free degree at CCV, we are telling Vermont’s young people we believe in them and we believe in their futures.” Vermont officials have been working for years to help alleviate what has become an acute labor shortage caused by declines in the number of working-age adults and the lack of trained workers.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the House of Delegates voted Wednesday to remove their caucus leader, months after an unsuccessful election cycle that saw the party lose full control of the state government. The 48-member caucus voted by secret ballot to remove Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn, who previously served as Virginia’s first female House speaker, according to lawmakers and staffers who spoke with reporters shortly after the vote. The membership voted against removing caucus chair Charniele Herring, lawmakers said. No immediate vote was held on who would fill Filler-Corn’s role. The vote on whether to remove the two women came after a campaign led in part by Del. Don Scott, an attorney and two-term House member from Portsmouth. Scott resigned a caucus leadership post, vice-chair for outreach, on Sunday and called for the election to remove Herring and Filler-Corn. He nominated himself to take over Filler-Corn’s role and nominated two young, progressive members to serve along with him. Filler-Corn, who served as the first female and first Jewish speaker of the House of Delegates for two years after Democrats flipped the chamber in 2019, conceded her role immediately. She called leading the caucus “the honor of my life.”\n\nWashington\n\nIssaquah: An invasive species is consuming and competing with native species in western Washington, including salmon. Scientists have spotted African clawed frogs in Issaquah, Lacey and Bothell, KING5 reports. The frogs were initially brought into the United States to be used in pregnancy tests and later became pets, said state wildlife scientist Max Lambert. Although Washington made it illegal to own them, some still do. Others who decided not to keep the frogs ultimately released them into ponds and streams. As officials began looking into the issue, they discovered hundreds of frogs. “These are considered one of the worst invasive species on earth,” Lambert said. “They’ll eat a lot of native insects, which are good forage food for our fishes and our amphibians, they will eat tadpoles of our native salamanders, and they’ll eat fish. We looked at some of their stomach contents – and they’re full of baby fish.” People working to restore salmon populations fear the frogs will infringe on that progress. Since Trout Unlimited began trapping in January, the organization has caught about 300 frogs, Rebecca Lavier said. About half of those have been found in the past few weeks. They believe it’s just a fraction of the population.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: An investigation of conditions at a jail has found no evidence of inhumane treatment of inmates, Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday. The Republican governor ordered the investigation last month after a TV station reported allegations of water deprivation, failure to provide toilet paper, and inmates having to sleep on hard floors without a mattress at the Southern Regional Jail in Beaver. “Our investigators talked with a bunch of people and pulled a bunch of records and, at the end of the day, they determined that the allegations were simply not true,” Justice said in a statement. The investigation by the state Department of Homeland Security determined inmates have continuous access to water at sinks in their cells and an industrial water fountain in each section of the jail. Every inmate is provided tumblers for water consumption, and the jail maintains a minimum three-day supply of bottled water for emergencies. In addition, inmates receive three drinks each day for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including those in segregation and quarantine units. There was no history of medical cases of dehydration, and no inmates have filed grievances for being deprived of water, according to jail records. In addition, ample toilet paper is provided to inmates, while the jail buys new mattresses for inmates regularly, according to the investigation.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Most of the respondents to the Wisconsin Conservation Congress’ spring survey say they support limiting the state’s wolf population to 350 animals. The congress, an influential group of sportspeople who advise the state Department of Natural Resources on policy, holds a survey each spring gauging respondents’ support for a wide range of outdoor and environmental proposals. This year’s survey was conducted online earlier this month. One question asked if the respondent supports limiting the wolf population to 350 animals. Of the Wisconsin residents who responded, 12,978 said they supported that number, 6,410 said they did not, and 2,277 had no opinion. Overall, 13,136 respondents said they supported the limit, 6,633 said they did not, and 2,326 had no opinion. The results are advisory only. The question comes as the DNR is revising its wolf management plan. A draft is expected to be released by June. The DNR’s current wolf management plan dates back to 1999 and lays out a goal of 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have held up the number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The virtual emergency room visits that a hospital began allowing early in the COVID-19 pandemic have been suspended, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Cheyenne Regional Medical Center’s telehealth visits began as a way to screen patients from home so that some could avoid visiting the hospital and risking the spread of the coronavirus, but as the virus’s spread “has cooled down,” CRMC is pausing the program and considering changes, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/29"}]}

The shift left smaller chains like Dash In behind.\n\nBut now the Maryland-based company is attempting to craft its own identity and compete with those industry giants. After completing a series of renovations over the past few years, Dash In is bringing a new look and menu to two new ground-up Delaware locations (more are likely on the way). Notably, they have ditched Shell and Exxon fuel and will instead offer Dash In-branded fuel in an attempt to make Dash In a household name.\n\n\"That's just how the business has evolved,\" said Mark Samuels, head of real estate for Dash In. \"We've identified and realized from a guest perspective it's difficult for people to realize what a Dash In is when it has a Shell or Exxon logo in front of it.\"\n\nDash In opened the first of its new stores, using its third-generation layout, in Middletown on Friday. The store is at Middletown Warwick Road and Doc Levinson Drive. It is part of the Northside shopping center where a Target and Sprouts Farmers Market are planned.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nThe company is putting the finishing touches on a store across from the Wilmington Airport along the northbound lanes of Route 40 near New Castle. Located between Crown Motel and Price Toyota, the store is scheduled to open Nov. 30.\n\nA third location has been proposed in Newark. It would replace the Rodeway Inn along Route 896 near the I-95 interchange. A Wawa with gas pumps is planned across the street.\n\nDELAWARE C-STORES:Wawa, Royal Farms adding multiple Delaware locations\n\nAll but one of the nine existing Dash In locations in Delaware have been renovated or rebuilt since 2017. There are more than 50 Dash In stores on the East Coast. Samuels said the company plans to triple that number in the next decade.\n\n\"It's all about scaling,\" Samuels said. \"We have a very aggressive growth plan.\"\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal spoke with Samuels last week to find out why the company thinks it has what it takes to compete with the likes of Wawa and Royal Farms in Delaware.\n\nThe unifying identity\n\nDash In's parent company, The Wills Group, has a long history as a fuel marketer.\n\nIt was the first company in Maryland to distribute under the Texaco name and has since had long-standing partnerships with Shell and Exxon. Putting Dash In on the signs at its gas stations may not seem like a significant change, but the company is hoping it helps its name stick in your head.\n\n\"Our competitors have kind of done the same in that regard,\" Samuels said.\n\nA new logo also comes along with the third-generation stores. It is a white circle with an icon resembling a Google Maps pin at the top and \"Dash In\" in lowercase script.\n\nA 'wholesome' menu\n\nOf greater consequence to travelers is what's for breakfast, lunch and dinner?\n\nThe new menu includes craft pizzas; grill-pressed burgers; and the chain's signature line of \"stackadillas,\" a take on a quesadilla. Samuels described it as a \"wholesome\" menu, adding that all of the new location's food prep and production is occurring on-site.\n\nThat includes everything down to the baked goods.\n\nThe new stores will have a three-tier convection oven, in addition to fryers and griddles. Earlier locations have smaller Merrychef ovens, Samuels said.\n\n\"We are taking a different approach to food service,\" Samuels said.\n\nThe Splash In car wash\n\nThe Wills Group launched a car wash brand called Splash in 2010.\n\nIt's an offering some convenience store companies don't have. Others that do \"don't focus attention on it\" as Dash In does, Samuels said.\n\nThe company now has more than 50 automatic car washes accompanying Dash In stores. They are a standard addition to new locations.\n\n\"We saw value in branding a very fragmented market,\" Samuels said.\n\nLike knowing what stores, restaurants and developments are coming and going in Delaware?

The law has narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities incompatible with life or if the life of the pregnant woman is in danger.\n\nState Republican leaders are celebrating the ban as a victory after a years-long legislative and legal effort.\n\n\"Today, the support for protection of life becomes a reality. Lives will be saved starting today,\" Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, said. \"Many Iowans have voted, volunteered and prayed to see this day finally happen.\"\n\nThey were joined in celebration by national organizations opposing abortion, including Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.\n\n“We thank Gov. Kim Reynolds, Attorney General Brenna Bird and legislators for persisting in the fight for life and representing the people’s will to protect babies with a heartbeat,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the nonprofit, in a statement.\n\nWith the ban now in place, Reynolds and other Republican leadership have said they plan to emphasize policies meant to aid pregnant women and to foster fatherhood. Iowa House Speaker Pat Grassley, R-New Hartford, said Monday that House Republicans will also continue to craft \"common sense policies that promote and protect life.\"\n\nThat could include legislation that failed in the last session defining life as beginning at conception. Critics have said such as bill would threaten in vitro fertilization.\n\n\"We will continue to promote strong families in all that we do in the Iowa House,\" Grassley said in a statement. \"We must build on the work we’ve already done to expand access to affordable child care, extend postpartum coverage on Medicaid, and improve our foster care and adoption systems.”\n\nThe new law was cleared after a June 28 ruling from the Iowa Supreme Court put an end to the district court's injunction on the ban. The justices' ruling also set a lower legal standard for laws limiting abortions, removing the previous \"undue burden\" standard and instead allowing for a rational basis standard.\n\nIn the face of this friendlier legal landscape for potential future restrictions, top Iowa Democrats say they are looking to the November elections to stop Republican lawmakers. Already, the issue of abortion is taking center stage in campaigns for state and federal offices, including the presidential race.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, called out Iowa's new restrictive abortion ban Monday as \"a Trump abortion ban,\" linking it to the former president whose three U.S. Supreme Court appointments helped overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that had legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nMore:What you should know about Iowa's 6-week abortion ban that is now in effect\n\nAbortion to take center stage in upcoming election, top Iowa Democrats say\n\nThe state's top Democrats strenuously denounced the law in a call with reporters Monday, placing blame on Reynolds, Bird and other elected Republican officials for their role in enacting what Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart described as a \"draconian abortion ban.\"\n\n“Essentially, what Kim Reynolds, Brenna Bird and the Republicans have done is practice medicine without a license,\" Hart said. \"They think that government, not women, know what’s best for themselves and for their families.”\n\nTop Democrats say they are centering local campaigns on the issue, arguing that most Iowans agree with their position. They point to results from polls such as the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll from March 2023, which found that 61% of Iowa adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nRepublican officials counter that Iowa voters have consistently reelected Republican lawmakers who have passed the six-week ban.\n\n\"Since first passing the heartbeat bill in 2018, Iowans have grown Republican majorities in the Legislature election after election,\" Melissa Saitz, spokesperson for the Iowa House Republicans, said in a statement. \"Democrats’ fear-mongering on this law may fool the media, but it hasn’t worked on Iowa voters in the past, and it won’t work this time either.”\n\nMore:With Iowa's 6-week abortion ban soon in effect, will Republicans go even further?\n\nStill, Democrats are confident Iowa voters will rebel once they see the impact of the stricter abortion ban, said Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights.\n\n\"Make no mistake, between now and Election Day a woman will die because of this abortion ban. A woman will be injured permanently, her reproductive future will be injured permanently because of this ban,\" she said. \"So what I'm asking Iowans to do is to look at the consequences of where we are now. We're no longer talking about a threat. We're talking about what really has happened. I think that's going to change Iowans' minds in many ways.\"\n\nIowa City resident shares firsthand experience\n\nOn Monday, Iowa City resident Allison Bierman was a featured speaker at an campaign event hosted by Democrat Christina Bohannan, who is challenging U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, for her 1st Iowa Congressional District seat. Bierman and her husband have been trying to have a child using in vitro fertilization since 2018.\n\nOn the first successful pregnancy attempt, she had an ectopic pregnancy that landed her in the hospital. Ectopic pregnancies develop outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes.\n\nIf undetected, ectopic pregnancy can lead to a rupturing of the fallopian tubes. These ruptures are the leading cause of maternal death in the first stage of pregnancy, according to a 2023 analysis by the National Institutes of Health, with a maternal mortality rate of 9% to 14%.\n\n\"If we would have just let it go on, I most likely would have died,\" Bierman said. \"The fact is that most women who are in my situation don't see any cardiac activity until after six weeks. If it's an ectopic pregnancy, it's really almost impossible to see that and confirm it via ultrasound, and by the time you can, it's well past the six-week mark and the woman's life is gravely in danger.\"\n\nBierman's doctors detected the ectopic pregnancy just a few days before she was six weeks pregnant. She had an abortion after six weeks and said she wasn't sure whether the exceptions in the current law would have allowed for her doctors to make that decision in the same timely manner because none of her vital organs was failing at the time she had the procedure.\n\n\"I'm at high risk for a repeat ectopic (pregnancy), so as we go into our seventh round of IVF with a donor embryo, we kind of have this hanging over our heads,\" Bierman said. \"We're just holding our breath and hoping that nothing happens that causes a complication where my doctors aren't able to help me.\"\n\nIf she experienced a repeat ectopic pregnancy, Bierman said she and her husband are \"blessed\" by a strong support network of people living inside and outside of the state of Iowa. She declined to elaborate further, citing worry over the potential for retaliation.\n\n\"This does not feel like a free country to me when I now have to consider fleeing to another state to get lifesaving health care, when all I'm trying to do is be a mother,\" Bierman said. \"I am probably the last person on Earth who would ever choose to have an abortion. But that wasn't my reality. It was just that, a choice between life and death.\"\n\nPresidential, congressional candidates weigh in on Iowa's ban\n\nAccording to Vice President Harris, Iowa is one of 22 states that have enacted a similar ban since the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"What this means is that one in three women of reproductive age in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban,\" Harris said. \"So what we need to do is vote. When I'm president of the United States, I will sign into law the protections for reproductive freedom.\"\n\nOther Democratic candidates vying for races in Iowa have linked the state law to their Republican opponents. During her event in Iowa City Monday, Bohannan said Miller-Meeks is \"happily watching her agenda become reality.\"\n\n\"After years of relentless attacks by anti-choice politicians, abortion is now banned across the state before most women even know they are pregnant,\" Bohannan said.\n\nMiller-Meeks fired back in a statement, accusing Bohannan of misrepresentation and extremism.\n\n“Christina Bohannan is blatantly misrepresenting my record. I am pro-life with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,\" Miller-Meeks said. \"My opponent is the extremist in this race. If she helps Democrats get control of the House, Washington will overturn all of Iowans’ ability to make our own laws and protections. She will vote to force taxpayer funding of abortion — and for wide-open abortion laws like they have in China and Russia.\"\n\nLanon Baccam, Democratic candidate for Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, lobbed similar criticism at his opponent, Republican U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn Monday. He accused Nunn of supporting a nationwide total abortion ban.\n\n“(Iowa’s ban) is really unfortunate to see, and a really good and clear reminder here of how important it is that we pay attention to the people who we elect because there are folks right now who will protect the rights found under Roe vs. Wade,\" Baccam said.\n\nNunn said Baccam was misrepresenting his position. He said in Congress, he was \"fighting back against extremes in both parties and working to bring real solutions for Iowa families.\"\n\n\"Good people can disagree on the issue of abortion,\" Nunn said in a statement. \"Let me be clear on where I’ve always stood: I’m pro-life, voted for exceptions and fought for access to contraceptives and IVF. I oppose a federal ban and believe abortion policy should be left up to the states.\"\n\nMichaela Ramm covers health care for the Des Moines Register.

We shouldn’t have done it,” Aguinaga said.\n\nBrian Fletcher, principle deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department, argued that the plaintiffs against the U.S. government \"mistook persuasion for coersion,\" saying the Biden administration was just using the \"bully pulpit\" to contradict dangerous misinformation as have previous administrations throughout U.S. history.\n\n\"(The government) can encourage, but not mandate,\" Fletcher said. \"We think that's what the government is doing. Our position is there wasn't any coersion.\"\n\nFletcher continued the government's argument that a prohibition of communication between U.S. officials and social media platforms could cause \"grave harm\" by preventing the government from “engaging in a vast range of lawful and responsible conduct.”\n\nHe said it could prevent agencies like the FBI from warning of dangerous misinformation about elections or possible terrorist threats.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomay said she had problems with the states’ arguments for not showing harm to the people they were representing. She said lawyers cited events that happened to the wrong people or contentious posts that were simply reposted by the litigants.\n\n“I don’t know what to make of all this,” Sotomayor added. “I’m not sure how we get to prove direct injury in any way.”\n\nThe court is expected to rule on the case in early summer.\n\nUSA Today contributed to this report.\n\nMore:Supreme Court schedules Louisiana Facebook case accusing Biden of censorship\n\nGreg Hilburn covers state politics for the USA TODAY Network of Louisiana.

But now, even as National Library Week arrives this week, the attempt to limit what materials are available to young people is spilling out from the classroom into the library.\n\nThough battles over access to controversial titles traditionally have been fought district by district, and even school by school, Republican-controlled states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas are now pushing statewide rules that make it easier for critics to remove books they dislike from school libraries in every community.\n\nAt the same time, although none have yet passed, more red states are seriously debating proposals that would make it easier for critics to force the removal of books even from public libraries serving the adult population.\n\n“The primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries,” says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association.\n\nTo the conservatives pushing this agenda, these new restrictions on libraries – like the parallel red-state laws limiting certain discussions in the classroom – are a means of protecting parental rights.\n\n“Parents want education for their kids: They are not interested in indoctrination through the school system,” DeSantis argued late last month when signing a bill facilitating efforts to remove books from school libraries.\n\nBut to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents – conservative Whites – over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society in which kids of color now compose a clear majority of the public school student body nationwide.\n\nThere is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project\n\nThe parallel battles over how teachers address race, gender and sexual orientation and how libraries regulate access to books represent the broadest attempt to limit what students are taught since the “loyalty oath” demands on teachers during the red scare period of the 1950s, or even the “Scopes trial”-era laws banning the teaching of evolution during the 1920s.\n\n“There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information,” says Vera Eidelman a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. On both fronts, she says, critics are “targeting the same set of viewpoints and experiences and aspects of education,” primarily materials relating to race, gender roles and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals.\n\n‘Parallel movements’\n\nThe torrent of laws approved in Republican-controlled states since 2021 to limit how teachers can discuss race, gender or sexual orientation has been part of a much broader current. Since the 2020 election, the 23 states in which Republicans control both the governorship and the state legislature have approved a surge of statutes restricting abortion rights, making it more difficult to vote, barring transgender girls and women from participating in grade school or college sports, banning transgender care for minors and increasing penalties for public protest. Cumulatively, as I’ve written, these proliferating red-state measures constitute an attempt to reverse what legal analysts call the “rights revolution” of roughly the past 60 years, in which Congress and the Supreme Court have generally expanded the circle of basic civil rights and liberties guaranteed to all Americans and reduced the ability of states to curtail those rights.\n\nCritics of the new wave of red-state measures see an especially powerful through line connecting the laws that make it more difficult to vote and increase the legal penalties for disruptive public protest with the bills that censor classroom instruction or empower critics to ban books in school libraries. All three thrusts make it more difficult for opponents to mobilize opposition to the agenda the red-state Republicans are advancing.\n\n“There are parallel movements across voting rights and protest rights and education rights,” says Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors. “In each case, you have a kind of flowering of experimentation of legislation to see what kind of things can fit to make it harder for people to vote, to make it more costly to protest and what would make it harder to access information in school.”\n\nThe restrictions on classroom teaching have exploded across the red states since 2021. Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who tracks these proposals for PEN America, counts at least 13 Republican-controlled states that have approved laws censoring how teachers talk about “divisive concepts,” such as systematic racial inequity, and five more states with GOP governors that have imposed administrative limits on such teachings through state boards of education or other bodies.\n\nThe conservatives pushing these bills portray them as a necessary barrier against liberal attempts to “indoctrinate” students through concepts such as critical race theory, an academic analysis of systemic discrimination, or the 1619 Project, a New York Times project that stressed the impact of slavery on American society. At a recent event with DeSantis, Alicia Farrant, a mother and school board candidate in Orange County, Florida, described her state’s version of these proposals as proof that parents “will not cower to the divisive agendas that are infiltrating our public schools in order to corrupt and destroy the educational foundations of our great nation.”\n\nThis wave does not appear to have crested. The Florida legislation barring discussion of sexual orientation in the youngest grades and limiting it in older grades has spawned copycat bills in other Republican-controlled states. More states are also considering laws that would extend the classroom censorship to public colleges and universities. Other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri, are considering their own bills on race and gender, and some of the states that have already passed such laws are doubling back with new proposals – such as a proposed amendment to the state constitution in Arizona to ban the teaching of critical race theory.\n\n“The level of focus and unity of language that we are seeing across all of these different bills is pretty extraordinary,” Sachs says. “There is an incredible amount of overlap, down to the punctuation of these bills, so we can definitely consider this a national campaign and not one that is responding to the specific context of each state.”\n\nPublic libraries are not immune\n\nThis campaign has developed so much momentum that it has overflowed the classroom to reach the library – particularly those in schools, but now also, for the first time, lapping at the doors of those that serve the public.\n\nIn recent decades, these fights have unfolded mostly locally, with challenges to specific books at individual libraries. Those fights are clearly intensifying: On Monday, the American Library Association reported that in 2021 it had recorded 729 such efforts to ban books at school or public libraries, the most since it began cataloging these efforts in 2000. The most-challenged books, the group reported, were from Black or LGBTQ authors or centered on characters from those communities.\n\nBut this struggle is also expanding to a new level, with multiplying red-state efforts to create statewide policies designed to lead to the removal of more books. In Texas, for instance, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is pressuring school boards to remove what he calls “pornography” from school libraries. Abbott’s letter followed a more detailed complaint from a Republican state legislator who sent districts a letter inquiring about the presence of 850 books, including several by prominent Black or LGBTQ authors.\n\nIn Florida, DeSantis signed a bill late last month that requires school libraries to post more information about their collections and seek community input on materials they acquire. Most importantly, the new law requires the state Department of Education to collect and publish a report on which books have been removed in any district across the state.\n\nAt the bill-signing ceremony, DeSantis said these provisions would ensure that students are exposed only to age-appropriate books. The new measures will increase schools’ “ability to choose what is appropriate for different age groups,” he argued. “Parents are going to have the ability to have their voices heard.”\n\nBut opponents of the legislation say the requirement for the state Education Department to publish a list of books removed in any district provides a road map for critics to demand the removal of such books in all districts.\n\nFlorida, as is the case with many of the cultural flashpoints now dominating red-state legislatures, has moved fastest and furthest. But Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature last week passed its own bill facilitating challenges to books in school libraries; measures targeting school libraries have also passed one chamber in the GOP-controlled legislatures in Kansas and Tennessee, though they face uncertain prospects of final approval. Similarly motivated bills have surfaced in Nebraska and Oklahoma as well.\n\nIn another escalation to the book wars, red state proposals are now emerging to ease the removal of books even in public libraries serving the adult, as well as the youth, population. These proposals generally would strip away the protection for librarians (and educators) from state obscenity laws, allowing officials to criminally charge librarians if they stock materials that a prosecutor considers obscene.\n\nWe all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association\n\nRepublican legislators have introduced bills to eliminate those protections in more than half a dozen states, according to the American Library Association’s tracking. None have yet passed into law, though one has cleared the state House in Idaho. Yet given the pace at which ideas once on the fringe, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, are advancing through the red states, Caldwell-Stone says the library association is “deeply concerned that one of these bills will eventually pass and will be used as a means of both intimidating librarians or actually charging them with crimes – based on this falsehood that mainstream materials, published by mainstream publishers, are somehow illegal speech unprotected by the First Amendment.”\n\nLast fall, a library faced such an investigation in Campbell County, Wyoming, after a local church complained about the presence of LGBTQ and sexual education materials there; a special prosecutor appointed by the county ultimately decided not to press charges.\n\nAll these confrontations underscore the cultural chasm between increasingly diverse younger generations and the socially conservative, predominantly White and Christian, Republican coalition that holds power in the red states. Children of color have constituted a majority of the public school K-12 student body since 2014, according to federal statistics, and now make up nearly 55% of the total. Gallup recently reported that 1 in 5 members of Generation Z, as well as 1 in 10 millennials, identify as LGBTQ, far more than in older generations. And the Public Religion Research Institute has found that more than a third of young adults identify as secular, without affiliation with any organized religion.\n\nSupporters of the efforts to restrict classroom teaching and/or ban books, by contrast, often cite a threat to “traditional” morality as a justification. When DeSantis signed the bill easing challenges to school library collections, one of the speakers he brought to the podium was a mother who had been prominent in protests against school masking requirements in Volusia County. She said her concern about school libraries was prompted in part by a picture book called “Red: A Crayon’s Story,” in which a crayon labeled red discovers that it’s really blue. The mother, Rebecca Sarwi, said she objected to “subliminal messaging for kids that young” that “normalizes them to believe” that they may be “something other than the unique individual that God created them to be.”\n\nServing ‘the needs of everyone’\n\nSuch arguments highlight what may be the core issue in this intensifying dispute: Though the classroom and library restrictions are being portrayed as an effort to strengthen “parents’ rights,” in practice they mean giving one set of parents a veto over educational content not only for their own kids, but others’ as well.\n\nLibrarians “don’t disagree with parents who want to guide their children’s readings … but they stand firmly opposed to one family dictating what is available to everyone else in a school library or a public library,” Caldwell-Stone told me. “We all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection.”\n\nPolls have generally found broad skepticism about the new classroom and library restrictions. A recent CBS survey found that more than four-fifths of Americans opposed banning books because they criticized American history or discussed race. A recent Grinnell College national poll found more than 70% of Americans trusted school officials to decide what materials were appropriate for their libraries. In a recent CNN poll, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how race is taught in schools.\n\nOne element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students. I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world. Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America\n\nOpponents of the restrictive measures are trying to organize greater resistance to them. Red Wine and Blue, a nationwide group of suburban Democratic-leaning women fighting the red-state proposals, has organized a nationwide “read-in” of banned books on Thursday hosted by Dolly Parton’s sister Stella that features the authors of targeted books such as “I Am Rosa Parks” and “Heather Has Two Mommies.” That same day, a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is holding a hearing on the book ban efforts, which could signal a turn toward greater attention to the issue from national Democrats.\n\n“After a long time of banging my head on the kitchen counter, I do feel like there’s progress and we are seeing some results,” says Katie Paris, Red Wine and Blue’s founder.\n\nParis says thousands of women have gone through the group’s training, which is designed to counter the organizing of the conservative organizations supporting the restrictions, such as Moms for Liberty. Though the number of proposed book bans continues to rise, Paris says, a smaller share of them have been approved in recent months by districts or school administrators, according to the group’s figures. In several cases, others note, students themselves are taking a more visible role in opposing these measures – as in the widespread walkouts in Florida against the “don’t say gay” bill and a lawsuit brought by Missouri students against a book ban in their school.\n\n“One element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students,” says Friedman. “I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world.”\n\nStill, even with occasional setbacks, the drive to control the flow of information to young people is demonstrating enormous energy in red states. With Congress unlikely to pass any national legislation combating this trend, opponents’ best chance to slow the tide are legal challenges, some of which are already working through the courts. In the 1982 Pico decision upholding the First Amendment rights of students, the Supreme Court ruled, as the ACLU’s Eidelman puts it, “schools cannot remove books from their shelves merely because they disagree with the ideas expressed in those books.”\n\nYet many observers note it’s unclear whether this more conservative Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority would uphold that standard. What is clear is that more of the red states appear intent on testing the boundaries of what the Supreme Court will allow through new laws facilitating the banning of books from school, or potentially even public, libraries.\n\n“This is one of the key characteristics of the era in which we live,” says Paris. “I think we’ve had to learn there are no bounds.

Howard Baker during the Watergate hearings in 1973 — \"What did the president know, and when did he know it?\" — is central to determining whether Trump's policy is both legal and constitutional.\n\nIt's been more than two years since presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\" It's been more than a year since President Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, only to see it blocked in court.\n\nAnd its been five months since Trump ventured into rhetorical overdrive on the third version of his travel ban by retweeting a far-right British group's anti-Muslim videos alleging atrocities such as \"Muslim Destroys a Statue of Virgin Mary!\"\n\nWere it another president, the question before the high court probably would concern only the scope of presidential powers in areas of foreign policy and immigration. But this is no ordinary president, and for that reason, the Supreme Court showdown is extraordinary.\n\nMore:Travel ban lexicon: From candidate Donald Trump's campaign promises to President Trump's tweets\n\n\"The president’s order,\" says Neal Katyal, attorney for the challengers to Trump's travel ban, \"is without parallel in our nation’s history.\"\n\nSo it's fitting that Wednesday, the Supreme Court should finally get its say, on the last day for oral arguments in its term. It's been a long time coming.\n\nLast June, after federal appeals courts struck down the second version of the travel ban, the justices said citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen without close ties to the USA could be barred for up to 90 days while vetting procedures were reviewed. Travelers with a \"bona fide\" connection were allowed to enter.\n\nAfter Trump changed the policy in September — subtracting Sudan, adding Chad, North Korea and Venezuela, setting separate criteria for each country and making it indefinite rather than temporary — federal courts again struck it down. The high court let it take effect while the case was appealed.\n\nHanging in the balance are nearly 150 million could-be travelers from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as others who may be protected or threatened by the Supreme Court's decision. Chad, a majority-Muslim nation, was removed from the list this month. North Korea and Venezuela, also named in Trump's latest executive order, are neither Muslim nor nations of frequent U.S. emigration.\n\nIt will be Trump's words — from his campaign promises to his presidential tweets — that will be front and center, as evidenced by the Justice Department's filing with the court last week:\n\n\"The president’s retweets,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco wrote, \"do not address the meaning of the proclamation at all.\"\n\n'Remarkably consistent'\n\nThe president's remarks do provide fodder for the ban's challengers.\n\nThe case reaches the Supreme Court from two liberal federal appeals courts — the 9th, based in San Francisco, and the 4th, based in Richmond, Va. Those courts and the district judges below said courts can and should examine the purpose behind government actions; that Trump's words reveal his purpose to be, at least in part, banning Muslims; that his initial focus on six majority-Muslim nations was a means to that end; and that Trump as president cannot distance himself from Trump as candidate.\n\nIndeed, most of the judges who issued rulings on Trump's travel ban said his statements as a candidate, president-elect and president are relevant.\n\n\"These statements, taken together, provide direct, specific evidence of what motivated both (executive orders): President Trump’s desire to exclude Muslims from the United States,\" Chief Judge Roger Gregory wrote for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in a 10-3 ruling.\n\nKatyal, a former U.S. acting solicitor general with vast experience arguing before the court, will represent Hawaii and immigration rights groups Wednesday. He contends in legal papers that \"for over a year, the president campaigned on the pledge, never retracted, that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States.\"\n\n\"The court need not engage in judicial psychoanalysis of the president’s motives,\" Katyal wrote. \"It may simply examine the objective indicia of intent that any neutral observer would consider.\"\n\nIn a brief submitted on behalf of constitutional law scholars, George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin says campaign promises — though they occur before a candidate is elected — signal a politician's intentions.\n\n\"Despite the stereotype that candidates routinely break their commitments, empirical evidence suggests that presidents keep the vast majority of their campaign promises — generally two thirds or more,\" Somin wrote.\n\nTaken together, Trump's promises as a candidate and pronouncements as president show he \"engaged in an open, sustained and targeted attack on people of the Muslim faith,\" says Amir Ali of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center in a court filing.\n\nCecillia Wang, deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union, which won its 4th Circuit battle against Trump, says the consistency of Trump's message should sway the justices.\n\n\"The court,\" Wang says, \"cannot ignore what the president has said.”\n\nPurpose over motive?\n\nJudges and legal analysts who defend the travel ban argue that Trump's words cannot form the basis for a constitutional violation. It takes too much interpretation, they say, to read anti-Muslim bias into an executive order or proclamation that, on its surface, is devoid of religious content.\n\nSeveral judges have gone further, arguing that campaign promises should be off-limits, or at least dwarfed by government actions that are not overtly discriminatory.\n\n\"Opening the door to the use of campaign statements to inform the text of later executive orders has no rational limit,\" 4th Circuit Judge Paul Niemeyer wrote in a dissent. He mused that such past history could extend to \"statements from a previous campaign, or from a previous business conference, or from college.\"\n\nFrancisco's final brief to the court says challengers have cherry-picked Trump's words, ignoring \"the president’s many statements disclaiming religious animus and praising Islam.\"\n\nTrump's supporters before the high court say his motives are not important compared with the travel ban's purpose: protecting the nation from terrorism.\n\n\"The law makes a clear distinction between motive and purpose,\" says a brief from the Foundation for Moral Law. \"The purpose of the travel ban — protecting America from terrorism — is as clear a secular purpose as anyone could possibly imagine. Candidate Trump’s motives in advocating a travel ban — whether to gain votes or any other purpose — are irrelevant.\"\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, which has represented several religious believers before the court, argues in its brief that \"tweets, public relations puff and video posts\" are no match for a president's implementation of immigration and national security policies.\n\nSome defenders of Trump's executive branch power do not condone his methods. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston and a prolific blogger on Supreme Court matters, says Trump's campaign rhetoric was \"terrible.\" But as president, he says, \"the stuff is much more innocuous.\"\n\n“If Trump did not have Twitter,\" Blackman says, \"this would be a 9-0 case.”\n\nMore:Supreme Court to issue final verdict on Trump travel ban\n\nMore:Supreme Court allows Trump travel ban to take full effect\n\nMore:Supreme Court removes travel ban case from calendar pending new review", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/06/23/washington-redskins-trademark-trial-first-amendment/29186277/", "title": "Confederate flag case argued in Redskins name case", "text": "Erik Brady\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. -- The Confederate flag, which is much in the news in other contexts this week, took center stage at a federal court hearing Tuesday morning in a long-running dispute over the Washington NFL club's team name.\n\nAttorneys for the team and attorneys for Native Americans who oppose the team name argued over the import of last week's Supreme Court case that said Texas did not violate the First Amendment when it declined to allow specialty license plates with images of the Confederate flag.\n\nThe team is asking U.S. District Court Judge Gerald Bruce Lee to overturn a decision made last year by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board that canceled the team's federal trademark registrations on the basis that \"Redskins\" was disparaging to a substantial composite of Native Americans when the marks were granted from 1967 to 1990. (The team retains its federal trademark rights while that ruling is under appeal.)\n\nMany of the arguments on each side are familiar in a case that has roots as far back as 1992, but Lee asked the attorneys at the start of the hour-and-40-minute hearing how last week's Texas license plate ruling could affect this matter.\n\nJeffrey Lopez, who represents Amanda Blackhorse and four other Native Americans who petitioned the appeal board to cancel the registrations, said their case had been buttressed by the Supreme Court ruling. Lopez said that because the team is free to use its team name with or without federal trademark registrations that its First Amendment rights are not at issue in this case.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nTeam attorney Robert Raskopf argued that a section of the Lanham Act that bars federal registrations that may disparage or bring a group of people into disrepute is unconstitutional because it limits the team's free speech rights. And he said that the license plate case is not a parallel to the team name case.\n\nRaskopf said for a state to issue plates with the Confederate flag could make it appear as government endorsement of the heritage group's appreciation for the flag; he said government does not appear to be endorsing the team's viewpoint by the mere act of issuing a federal trademark registration. He also said that license plates are clearly about government speech as they include a state's name and involve the state function of vehicle registration. He said it is clear in other sorts of cases that a trademark owner, not the government, is the speaker.\n\n\"No one looks at a Coke can and sees the federal government speaking,\" Raskopf said.\n\nLopez said the act of federal registration of a trademark is in itself government speech. He compared the circled-R — the symbol of federal trademark registration — to a state's name on a license plate. And he said the reasoning behind the license plate case is \"strikingly close\" to the disparagement section of the Lanham Act.\n\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans can put bumper stickers on their cars with the Confederate flag, Lopez said, they just can't put them on specialty plates — and that in similar fashion the team is free to use and promote its name without federal trademark protection.\n\nRaskopf advanced another constitutional argument when he said that the taking of the team's federal trademark registrations violates the team's due process rights. Moreover, he said the other side had failed to prove that a substantial composite of Native Americans thought of the team name as disparaging in the relevant time period — 1967 to 1990 — and especially when the name is used in the context of pro football.\n\nLopez pointed to a meeting between team president Edward Bennett Williams and several Native American leaders in 1972 that indicated vocal opposition during the time frame. He said that the leader of the National Congress of American Indians alone represented the voices of many tribes.\n\nRaskopf argued that the seven Native American leaders at that 1972 meeting represented themselves as individuals. He said that news reports at the time quoted the leaders as saying they would sue if the team did not change its name — and argued that because they never did that it's unfair for others to make legal claims many years later.\n\nJudge Lee asked pointed questions of both sides and said he would issue a written decision that could decide the case or determine if it goes to a bench trial. A ruling could come relatively quickly as the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia carries a reputation as a \"rocket docket.\"\n\nIn a corridor outside the courtroom, attorneys for both sides said they were pleased with the day's arguments and expected to prevail. Raskopf said a burden on speech is as bad as a ban on speech and that cancellation of the team's federal registrations is a significant burden. Lopez said he thinks chances that Judge Lee might find the Lanham Act unconstitutional are exceedingly small.\n\nWould the team consider changing its name if it does not prevail in court? \"That's not for me to decide,\" Raskopf said, smiling. \"Based on what I know, the answer is no. I believe my client has made himself clear on that point.\"\n\nRaskopf was apparently referring to a comment made by team owner Daniel Snyder to USA TODAY Sports in 2013 when he said he would never change his team's name: \"NEVER — you can use caps.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/01/politics/ketanji-brown-jackson-senate-question/index.html", "title": "New Senate questionnaire details Ketanji Brown Jackson's White ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee posted on Tuesday Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate questionnaire for her Supreme Court nomination, as lawmakers’ scrutiny of her record takes center stage in her confirmation push.\n\nThe questionnaire revealed new details about the judge’s contact with the White House in the weeks leading up to her nomination announcement, and it shed light on how she’d approach recusals if confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhite House counsel Dana Remus reached out to Jackson on January 30 about the vacancy, according to the submission.

Ted Cruz said Tuesday night. \"Look around you. This arena holds about 18,000 souls. Now imagine 639 arenas just like this filled to the brim.\"\n\nAmericans are showing increasing concern around immigration issues, a Gallup Poll from February showed. For the first time in a decade, Americans said immigration is the most important issue facing the country. A separate survey by the Pew Research Center showed that 80% of Americans said the government is doing a \"bad job dealing with the large number of migrants at the border.\"\n\nHow have Trump and President Joe Biden each approached concerns about border security? Here's what we found:\n\nBorder encounters hit a record high\n\nThe Trump administration promised \"the largest deportation effort\" in U.S. history if elected again.\n\nDuring his presidency, about 935,000 non-residents were deported, while there had been about 340,000 such deportations under Biden through February, NBC News reported, citing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nU.S. Border Patrol encounters have increased over the past decade. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, border encounters primarily included people apprehended while illegally entering the country, according to USAFacts, a nonprofit that provides analysis on U.S government data.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, the Border Patrol began expelling migrants without giving them the opportunity to seek asylum. This action was carried out under a public health provision called Title 42.\n\nWhen Biden first took office, he vowed to reverse some of Trumps strict immigration policies, including turning away unaccompanied minors who arrived at the U.S. border without a parent or guardian. His administration temporarily kept Title 42 until it expired in May 2023.\n\nSince taking office, the number of people taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol under the Biden administration reached a record high, averaging 2 million people per year, according to the Washington Post.\n\nHow much money does the U.S. spend on border security?\n\nLast year, the Biden administration said its budget allocates nearly $25 billion for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nYou can keep up with the USA TODAY Network's live coverage of the 2024 Republican convention and watch the livestream here.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/12/donald-trump-busy-week-court/72568624007/", "title": "Trump cases update: action in at least 5 court cases this week", "text": "Former President Donald Trump has a busy week in at least five courts, with decisions expected on whether he can continue to do business in New York state and whether a federal trial on charges of election interference will be postponed.\n\nThe variety of court hearings reflects the crowded litigation calendar Trump faces as he campaigns to return to the White House as the Republican front-runner.\n\nOn Monday, Trump is attending a closed-door hearing in Fort Pierce, Florida, in his federal case alleging the mishandling of classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon will meet with Trump and his lawyers to discuss evidence in the case – without Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. Then Cannon will meet with Smith.\n\nLater Monday, Trump faces a deadline to ask the Supreme Court to hear arguments about whether he is immune from prosecution on charges of election interference.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Trump isn’t immune. But the appeals court agreed to continue postponing U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan’s trial if Trump commits to appealing to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe arguments in the criminal case would come on the heels of the high court’s hearing Thursday on whether Colorado can remove him from the state’s presidential ballot for insurrection in the Capitol attack Jan. 6, 2021. Lawyers for Colorado and Smith’s team are seeking quick answers in both cases.\n\nThursday features two more hearings in criminal cases against trump.\n\nIn New York, state Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan scheduled a hearing on charges Trump falsified business records in 2016 to pay an adult-film actress and a former Playboy model not to talk about their claims he had sex with them.\n\nMerchan had scheduled the trial to begin March 25, but pretrial work on the case paused while the federal cases took center stage. The hearing could clarify how soon the case could go to trial.\n\nIn Georgia, Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee will hold a hearing about the prosecutor in the election interference case against Trump and 14 co-defendants. Trump and other defendants have asked to remove District Attorney Fani Willis from the case because of her personal relationship with another prosecutor, Nathan Wade.\n\nWillis has acknowledged the relationship, but said she hasn't benefitted from it financially and that she intends to remain on the case. Removing her could further delay a trial not expected to start until at least August.\n\nAlso possible this week is a ruling for damages in the civil fraud case against Trump in New York. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron has aimed to issue his ruling by mid-February, after already ruling Trump and his namesake company committed fraud by overvaluing real-estate repeatedly for years to gain benefits from lenders and insurers.\n\nEngoron postponed his ruling after the New York Times reported that a witness, Trump’s former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, was negotiating a possible plea agreement for alleged perjury during the trial. But lawyers for Trump and state Attorney General Letitia James each urged Engoron to issue his ruling without waiting for possible criminal charges against Weisselberg.\n\nJames has asked for $370 million and a halt to Trump doing business in New York.

Ron DeSantis isn't known for his subtlety.\n\nBut when it comes to abortion, an issue that, after the fall of Roe v. Wade over the summer, became top of mind to the voters he'll ask next month for a second term, DeSantis has taken an uncharacteristically avoidant approach.\n\nThe governor vowed in June to \"expand pro-life protections\" after the Supreme Court handed down the opinion overturning Roe but otherwise has either not addressed or declined to elaborate on his vision for abortion policy in Florida.\n\nAdvocates on both sides of the issue told the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida that the most likely next step is a so-called heartbeat bill banning the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nBut as mail-in voting has begun ahead of the November election, DeSantis has faced renewed criticism from state Democrats over his silence on the issue.\n\nDodging specifics:What are Ron DeSantis' plans on abortion in Florida?

Its framers designed it that way.\n\nSince Politico published a leaked version of the Supreme Court opinion in May, throwing abortion into center stage of midterm election politics, the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida counted at least 10 times DeSantis dodged specifics.\n\nPolitico publishes leaked opinion\n\nDeSantis did not issue statements on the governor's website or Twitter accounts reacting to the news. He also wouldn't say during a news conference whether he would seek more restrictions beyond the 15-week ban (House Bill 5) that went into effect in July, according to Politico.\n\nSupreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade\n\nThe governor released a statement on Twitter on June 24 saying he would \"work to expand pro-life protections.\"\n\nThe full statement read: \"The prayers of millions have been answered. For nearly fifty years, the U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited virtually any meaningful pro-life protection, but this was not grounded in the text, history or structure of the Constitution. By properly interpreting the Constitution, the Dobbs majority has restored the people's role in our republic and a sense of hope that every life counts. Florida will continue to defend its recently-enacted pro-life reforms against state court challenges, will work to expand pro-life protections, and will stand for life by promoting adoption, foster care and child welfare.\"\n\nPublic appearances after ruling\n\nSince the post-Roe statement, DeSantis \"has not seemed eager to engage on the issue,\" the Tallahassee Democrat reported July 2.\n\nHe didn't mention the ruling \"during two more recent public appearances and didn’t take questions from reporters after either event. He hasn’t spoken publicly about the ruling.”\n\nGovernor's office declines to weigh in\n\nIn the same Democrat story, governor's office-turned campaign spokesperson Christina Pushaw declined to say whether DeSantis would pursue a six-week ban, which he said he supported during his first gubernatorial campaign in 2018. From the article:\n\n\"Asked if the governor will pursue such a measure, which leading Florida anti-abortion activists have pointed to as a preferred next step in recent days, DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw said ‘we very much look forward to pursuing additional legislative protections for the unborn’ but did not offer specifics.”\n\nIn subsequent articles published in July by three more news outlets, representatives from the governor's office also declined to elaborate.\n\nDeSantis spokesperson Bryan Griffin told the Tampa Bay Times, “We very much look forward to pursuing additional legislative protections for the unborn. Our future legislative action necessarily depends on the resolution of these legal issues.”\n\n“A spokesman for Mr. DeSantis’s office would only refer to a previous statement when asked whether a special session of the legislature — or any other move related to abortion — was in the offing,\" The New York Times reported.\n\nAccording to WPTV NewsChannel 5, “Press Secretary Christina Pushaw said the office didn't have anything to add to the governor's prior statement but added, ‘we will continue to defend HB 5, and the fight to protect life is far from over.’”\n\nAfter August Cabinet meeting\n\nAfter a statewide Cabinet meeting that happened to fall on the Aug. 23 Primary, DeSantis again sidestepped the issue. The Florida Phoenix reported:\n\n“I think we want to make sure that what we’ve done will stick, and then work with the Legislature,” DeSantis said.\n\n“But I will tell you, you know, that 15 (week ban) was very difficult to be able to achieve. We were happy that we were able to achieve it. And so, you know, we look forward and we welcome future endeavors. But we realize there’s still going to be a fight on the legal end on that.”\n\nAsked at that point what sort of abortion-related legislation he’d like to see, DeSantis left the room.\n\nOne last dodgeball\n\nWhen asked this week what specific abortion restrictions the governor is seeking, spokesperson Bryan Griffin fell back on previous statements in a response to the USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida:\n\n\"As the governor stated after the Dobbs decision was released, we celebrate that decision as an answer to countless prayers from across the State of Florida and the nation. We very much look forward to pursuing additional legislative protections for the unborn.\n\n\"Currently, we are actively engaged in a legal battle over the recently signed pro-life HB 5. These challenges are pending in state court and are distinct from the federal issues resolved by the Supreme Court. Our future legislative action necessarily depends on the resolution of these legal issues.\n\n\"We are in continuous contact with the legislature as this litigation proceeds, and we look forward to future policy plans to defend the unborn.\"\n\nKathryn Varn is statewide enterprise reporter for the Gannett/USA Today Network - Florida.

We threw ourselves down on the floor. Then the emergency doors were opened and we threw ourselves at them.\"\n\nHow are Japan's buildings prepared for earthquakes?\n\nJapan, which rests along the tectonic belt in the Pacific Basin known as the Ring of Fire, is prone to earthquakes. The country has long been a leader in disaster preparedness and uses advanced warning systems, practiced response services and strict building codes.\n\nJapan was the first country to institute a building code that requires contractors to consider seismic force, according to the Building Center of Japan. The code took effect in 1924.\n\nIn 1950, Japan enacted the Building Standard Law to further protect residents from building collapses and damage from extreme events such as typhoons and earthquakes. The law has been amended through the decades as technology has improved and often after a natural disaster, such as the 2011 earthquake, which prompted the construction of sea walls along the country's northeast coastline that reach heights of 41 feet.\n\nThe law, which requires regular inspections of a building's structural integrity, applies to buildings with two or more stories and those with more than 650 square feet of floor space. But the standards are different in regions throughout the country depending on the area’s history and conditions.\n\nNewer buildings, especially skyscrapers near the coast, undergo rigorous planning evaluations and must meet strict standards. Many of the country’s older buildings have been made more resilient with shock absorbers and steel reinforcements.\n\nEmergency drills, which are common in Japan, also prepare the country’s citizens and first responders for natural disasters.\n\n“There is probably no people on Earth other than Japanese who are so disaster-ready,” said Toshitaka Katada, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in disasters.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/04/03/taiwan-earthquake-live-updates/73188095007/", "title": "Taiwan earthquake live updates: Aftershocks rumble; rescues ...", "text": "After a massive earthquake killed nine and injured over 1,000 people early Wednesday, rescuers in Taiwan were combing through the rubble to find scores of people missing or trapped, while experts say a slew of aftershocks could make the search and rescue even more dangerous.\n\nTaiwan's National Fire Agency said at least 1,050 people were injured when the earthquake, measured as 7.2 magnitude by Taiwan officials and 7.4 by the U.S. Geological Survey, struck near the east coast city of Hualien at about 8 a.m. local time. Hualien is a popular tourist destination 100 miles south of Taipei, where buildings swayed and some damage was reported. A series of aftershocks followed, reaching up to 6.4 magnitude.\n\nSome buildings tumbled or were leaning precariously while scores of people were trapped inside the damaged structures. Around two dozen of almost 50 hotel workers on their way to a resort in Taroko National Park had been located.\n\nThe temblor set off a tsunami warning for southern Japan and the Philippines that was later lifted.\n\n\"It was very strong. It felt as if the house was going to topple,\" said Chang Yu-lin, 60, a worker in a hospital in the capital of Taipei.\n\nTaiwan has developed significant search-and-rescue capabilities, but it's a difficult undertaking to identify and recover victims who may be buried deep under concrete while dodging the perils of aftershocks, said Joseph Barbera, an emergency physician and professor of engineering management and systems engineering at the George Washington University. Barbera was part of a response team deployed by the United States Agency for International Development to the 1999 Jiji earthquake that killed over 2,400 people in Taiwan.\n\n\"The issue of trying to identify anyone that might be alive can be difficult. Then getting to those that you’ve located that are deeply entombed can require a Herculean effort with multidisciplinary teams,\" Barbera told USA TODAY.\n\nThe death toll may rise some in the coming days as search teams sift through collapsed structures, Barbera said.\n\nIn Hualien, the city's mayor, Hsu Chen-Wei, said by the end of the day everyone in buildings there that are considered dangerous had been evacuated and demolition had begun on four.\n\nThe White House said Wednesday morning that it is monitoring the impacts from the earthquake on Taiwan and Japan. \"The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance. All those affected are in our prayers,\" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ On Thursday morning, a helicopter rescued six people who had been trapped in a mining area, the fire department said.\n\n∎ The railway line to Hualien re-opened ahead of schedule on Thursday, although one rural station north of Hualien city remains closed due to damage, the railway administration said.\n\n∎ Officials in Taiwan's air force said six F-16 fighter jets were slightly damaged in the earthquake, but they are expected to return to service soon.\n\n∎ Wu said an investigation is underway to determine why not all Taiwanese received a nationwide alert issued following the quake.\n\n∎ There was no tsunami threat to Hawaii, the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam or the west coast of North America, the U.S. National Tsunami Warning Center said.\n\nEarthquake rocks Taiwan:Strongest temblor in 25 years\n\nTaiwan's earthquake preparedness may have spared lives, damage\n\nTaiwan, prone to earthquakes, sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” where 90% of the world's temblors take place. Emergency services are prepared for quake rescue and recovery. The densely populated island nation is also exceptionally well prepared for earthquakes, Barbera said, which makes the damage from Wednesday's quake potentially much less than it would be otherwise.\n\nTaiwan is a \"model\" for its seismic building codes and strict enforcement of them, he said. Critical buildings that need to function in emergencies are built on a foundation that allows for it to roll during a quake, he said. Taipei 101, a skyscraper that once held the title of tallest building in the world, features a famous tuned mass damper, essentially a massive pendulum that sways during an earthquake to counteract and limit any swaying of the building.\n\n\"There's a dramatic difference between building failures – structural failures, not just buildings – in Taiwan versus other other countries that have similar size earthquakes,\" Barbera said. \"They’ve had a true commitment for decades to risk reduction.\"\n\n'We are frightened. We are so nervous.'\n\nLinda Chen, 48, said her apartment in downtown Hualien city had been so badly damaged in an earlier earthquake in 2018 that she had to move. But her new apartment block was damaged, too, in the latest earthquake.\n\n\"We worry the house could collapse anytime. We thought we had already experienced it once in Hualien and it would not hit us again, because God has to be fair,\" she said.\n\n\"We are frightened. We are so nervous.\"\n\n− Reuters\n\nAftershocks near epicenter could continue for days\n\nAt least 29 aftershocks above a 4.9 magnitude have rumbled near the city of Hualien on Wednesday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Dozens more have been clocked by Taiwan's Central Weather Administration.\n\nWu Chien-fu, director of Taiwan’s Seismology Center, said aftershocks reaching 7.0 could shake the nation of 23 million people for three or four more days. Over a dozen aftershocks on Wednesday were greater than 5.0 in magnitude, and one was over 6.0, USGS data shows.\n\nAftershocks are a sequence of smaller quakes that are a part of the \"readjustment process\" along a fault line where a main shock took place, the USGS said. They can continue for days, weeks, months or even years after a large earthquake, and their frequency usually decreases with time.\n\nDozens rescued from tunnels where they were trapped\n\nOver 70 people have been evacuated from tunnels near Hualien City, fire authorities said. Video published by Taiwan National Fire Agency shows responders conducting search-and-rescue operations underneath collapsed buildings.\n\nThe rescued people include two German nationals.\n\nWhere did the earthquake strike?\n\nThe earthquake’s epicenter was 6 miles northeast of the small town of Hualien City.\n\nThe area is known by some as “the Hawaii of Taiwan” because of its warm, tropical weather, lush greenery and crystal clear ocean waters. In addition, it’s home to the Taroko Gorge, a stunning natural granite gorge with transparent turquoise and dark blue water that is a destination for hikers.\n\nSigns along the pathways and hiking trails in the gorge warn visitors of possible falling rocks. Five-star hotels in the town of Hualien and in the vicinity of Taroko National Park where the gorge is located cater to tourists from around the globe coming to see and hike the area.\n\n− Elizabeth Weise\n\nVideos show dramatic moments when earthquake hit\n\nSocial media videos showed rescuers using ladders to help trapped people out of windows. Buildings could be seen collapsing onto streets as landslides swept across roads and highways. Bridges swayed and items on shelves splattered onto the ground. Some damage was reported to the Taipei subway system, which closed briefly before resuming partial service.\n\n\"At present the most important thing, the top priority, is to rescue people,\" said President-elect Lai Ching-te, speaking outside one of collapsed buildings in Hualien.\n\nRescue and recovery efforts underway\n\nThe quake shook Taipei, knocking out power in several parts of the city. Elsewhere, authorities said they had lost contact with 50 travelers aboard four minibuses heading to a hotel in a national park, Taroko Gorge.\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the military will be deployed to help with rescue and recovery operations. She pledged that federal and local governments would cooperate with each other to \"minimize the impact of the disasters.\"\n\nShallow quake was close to land\n\nWu said the quake's epicenter was very shallow and close to land, the result of movement in the Philippine Sea Plate. He said it felt strong in Taipei because of the “basin effect,” which occurs when earthquake reverberations become trapped in soft ground.\n\nThe quake was Taiwan's largest since the 1999 Jiji earthquake that killed over 2,400 people and injured 11,300 more.\n\nNuclear power stations unaffected\n\nMost power has been restored after the quake, electricity utility Taipower said, with the island's two nuclear power stations unaffected.\n\nTaiwan's high-speed rail operator said no damage or injuries were reported on its trains, although services would be delayed as it made inspections.\n\nA major supplier of chips to Apple and Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. said it had evacuated some fabrication plants and safety systems were operating normally. Nvidia said it expects no supply disruptions from the earthquake.\n\nIt said later its workers were safe and had returned to their workplaces shortly after the earthquake, adding that impacted facilities were expected to resume production during the night.\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/08/08/earthquake-japan-tsunami/74716587007/", "title": "Earthquake hits southwest Japan leading to tsunami warning", "text": "A strong earthquake rattled southwestern Japan Thursday triggering tsunami advisories, the United States Geological Survey is reporting.\n\nThe notable quake registered a magnitude 7.1, the USGS said, and took place about 12 miles southeast of Miyazaki, a city on the island of Kyushu.\n\nThe quake occurred at 4:43 p.m. local time (12:43 a.m. EST).\n\nIt was not immediately known if anyone was injured or whether damage was reported on the island but public broadcaster NKS said waves as high as 50 cm (more than 1.6 feet) had already been observed.\n\nThe outlet also reported Japanese Meteorological Agency on Thursday issued a megaquake advisory, per local protocol.\n\nThe possibility the quake was a foreshock for a larger earthquake is always of concern, but less likely with every hour that passes, said Ole Kaven, a USGS research geophysicist.\n\n\"The rule of thumb is that there’s a 5% chance of an event larger than the main shock happening, and that probability will decrease the more time that passes,\" he said.\n\nEarthquake:Magnitude 4.5 earthquake hits Utah; no damage or injuries immediately reported\n\nJapanese government checking for damages, casualties\n\nThere have been no reports of abnormalities at nuclear power plants on the island, Reuters reported, and officials were \"checking for damage and casualties,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.\n\nAccording to its last census, Miyazak had an estimated population of just under 400,000 people.\n\nData provided by USGS showed the earthquake registered more than 15 miles deep in the ocean.\n\nCould this quake have been related to Tuesday's LA quake?\n\nIt’s very unlikely the Japanese earthquake was related to the magnitude 5.2 earthquake that struck northwest of Los Angeles on Tuesday night, but not impossible, USGS said. That quake has resulted in more than 270 aftershocks so far, though all have been smaller.\n\nEarthquakes that occur large distances apart can be linked, by the seismic waves passing through the earth’s crust, said Tom Parsons, a research geophysicist with USGS.\n\n“We see it around the world,” he said. “They could increase the water pressure within a fault, or the shaking could trigger another fault that’s close to slipping,” he said.\n\nSuch events, called “dynamic triggering,” tend to happen within a day or two after the initial earthquake. But even when it does happen, they tend to be very minor, no more than magnitude 1 and 2, Parsons said.\n\n“The likelihood of the Los Angeles earthquake having an impact in Japan is pretty small,” he said. “It’s typically the larger earthquakes that can trigger longer waves that pass through the crust.”\n\nGiven the large number of earthquakes that occur each day around the world – more than 1,300 are detectable every day – the number of dynamically triggered temblors is quite small, he said.\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.

For the latest news on the quake, please see today's live file for Wednesday, April 3 .\n\nA powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake rocked Taiwan on Wednesday, the strongest tremor to hit the island in at least 25 years, killing at least four people, injuring dozens, and sparking nearby Japan to issue a brief evacuation advisory for coastal areas.\n\nThe quake hit shortly before 8 a.m. local time, according to Taiwan's Central Weather Administration. The quake's epicenter was located about 11 miles south of the coastal city of Hualien, about 96 miles southeast of Taipei.\n\nTaiwan's government said four people had died in Hualien County and more than 50 people were injured. At least 26 buildings have collapsed and about 20 people were trapped, according to Taiwan’s national fire agency.\n\nRescue operations are ongoing, and aftershocks have caused residents to flee their homes and remain outside, Taiwan’s official central news agency reported.\n\nFootage from Taiwan television stations showed collapsed buildings in Hualien with some leaning at an angle. Taiwan's Central Weather Administration gave the quake a magnitude of 7.2 while the USGS recorded it at 7.4 with a depth of about 22 miles.\n\nThe United States Geological Survey recorded numerous aftershocks in the same region, including one with a magnitude of 6.5. Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said it recorded more than 25 aftershocks.\n\nRescue and recovery efforts underway\n\nThe strong quake rocked Taipei, knocking out power in several parts of the city. Taipower, the state-owned electricity operator, said more than 87,000 homes in Taiwan were still without power.\n\nTaiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen said the military will be deployed to help with rescue and recovery operations.\n\n\"The national military will meet the needs of local governments and provide support to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the citizens,\" she said in a statement posted on Facebook.\n\nTaiwan, Japan, and the Philippines have all canceled their tsunami warnings.

Here's how much rain parts of NC received\n\nMore rainfall through Sunday\n\nA Flood Warning is still in effect for Asheville and Buncombe County until 1:08 p.m. Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. The warning affects Swannanoa River at Biltmore in Buncombe County.\n\nDevastating, historic flooding continues across the French Broad and Swannanoa river valleys, following the historic 6 to 22 inch rainfall resulting from a stationary front interacting with tropical moisture and Tropical Storm Helene, NWS reports.\n\nMost of the French Broad River and tributaries have crested. While conditions will gradually improve, the floodwaters receding will reveal the extent of the damage.\n\nNumerous roads will require days to weeks of closure. Motorists should not attempt to drive around barricades or drive cars through flooded areas. Most flood related deaths occur in automobiles, the NWS said.\n\nWhy did Helene bring so much rain?\n\nEarlier this week, meteorologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned that a band of moisture associated with Helene, known as a predecessor event, was likely to bring heavy rainfall before the storm made landfall, according to USA TODAY.\n\nAs Helene’s massive circulation combined with this moisture, it resulted in even more rain before transitioning into a post-tropical cyclone. Recent studies indicate that some hurricanes are absorbing more moisture from the warming Gulf of Mexico, which further increases rainfall totals.\n\nHistoric Biltmore Village under water in Buncombe\n\nBiltmore Village is largely underwater after historic flooding by remnants of Hurricane Helene, later downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nBuncombe County officials announced Sept. 26 that residents in Biltmore Village in Asheville should evacuate ahead of Helene making landfall.\n\nMore:Video: See aerial footage of historic flooding in Biltmore Village after Helene\n\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Swannanoa River at Biltmore crested at 26.1 feet, nearly 6 feet above the record, at 3:45 p.m. Sept. 27. As of 10:30 p.m., the river was down to 20.9 feet. The previous record for that location was 20.7 feet.\n\nAccording to the NOAA’s standards, major flooding begins at 18 feet.\n\nAt the height of the storm, more than 500,000 Duke Energy customers in North Carolina were without power. More than 200,000 of those customers were in Buncombe County. That number had dropped to about 100,000 by late afternoon Sept. 28.\n\nA curfew is in effect for Asheville, starting at 7:30 p.m. and ending the next morning at 7:30 a.m. through at least Sunday.\n\nCanton Mayor says 'no excuse' for failure in cell services\n\nCanton Mayor Zeb Smathers called flooding to hit the area “an unimaginable and horrific disaster” before expressing frustration over cell phone service failures.\n\n\"I must also express my deep frustration and anger with the failures in cellular communication, particularly the inability to rely on services when we needed them most. From the very start of this crisis, our ability to communicate with basic emergency services was crippled, and there is no excuse for this,\" Smathers said.\n\n\"The idea that not just us here in Canton and across Western North Carolina cannot communicate to our citizens, families, and our emergency management is absolutely disgraceful. Our people and their families demand the best, especially in the historic moment that we needed it the most; something our cellular providers have not done.\"\n\nUltimately he said citizens and first responders ae exhibiting the utmost “grit and grace” during the disaster.\n\nHe asked residents to stay away from downtown due to instability and unsafe conditions.\n\nBill's Creek Fire will work into night on rescues\n\nBills Creek Fire Department is assisting North Carolina Emergency Management and the North Carolina National Guard in evacuations out of the Bat Cave area.\n\n\"You will be hearing helicopters most of the night tonight,\" the department posted on Facebook.\n\n100 people rescued in Lake Lure/Chimney Rock\n\nOver 100 citizens in the Lake Lure/Chimney Rock area were rescued Saturday, according to Rutherford County Emergency Management thanks to multiple efforts by law enforcement, fire departments, the National Guard and those assisting from other counties and states.\n\nRescue efforts will continue tonight.\n\nMore:See photos, videos of flooding and damage in Chimney Rock, Lake Lure, NC\n\nTransit transported those rescued to the RS Central High School shelter at 641 US-221, Rutherfordton, NC 28139.\n\nMission Hospital being overrun by cell service seekers\n\nFreelance photographer Josh Bell, present at Mission Hospital Emergency Room tonight, saw crowds of people trying to get cell service, no parking and people parked on curbs. A nurse who did not wish to be identified – and was directing parking traffic – told him that someone might have said that the hospital had cell service, and the word spread.\n\nParking lots were being overrun, and the ER was “suffering” because it was harder to see those in need of medical attention, rather than people seeking cell service.\n\nThe Citizen Times has reached out multiple times over the past two days to Mission Hospital, as well as to AdventHealth and Pardee in Hendersonville. We have not yet received any responses.\n\nCooper: Supplies to be brought by air\n\nSupplies are being brought into the region by air following devastating across Western North Carolina as search and rescue operations are underway.“Efforts are also underway to get power and communications restored, and we’re bringing in needed supplies by air,\" Gov. Roy Cooper said. More than 200 people have been rescued from flood waters in North Carolina following Helene’s torrential rains, North Carolina Department of Public Safety reports.\n\nTeams from 19 states and three federal teams are aiding in rescue efforts. Many areas in the mountains received more than 10 inches and as much as 29 inches of rain causing catastrophic flooding. High winds gusting up to hurricane strength also brought down trees, power lines and cell towers across the region.\n\nAcross North Carolina, 29 counties and 52 towns and cities have issued States of Emergency, in addition to the statewide State of Emergency declared by Cooper.\n\nCooper Saturday requested a Major Disaster Declaration from the federal government for North Carolina for 39 counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians for federal Public Assistance and Individual Assistance in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene.\n\n'Disaster Roaming' activated for cell phones\n\nTelecommunications partners have activated \"Disaster Roaming,\" which allows any phone on any cellular network to access any available network to connect to. Telephone service providers are working to restore communications across the area, the state Department of Public Safety reported in a press release.\n\nCellular telephone service remains spotty west of I-77 due to significant infrastructure damage. “The State Emergency Response Team is working around the clock responding to severe impacts from Helene’s devastation. We are grateful for our local, state and federal partners and their teamwork to help North Carolinians hit hard by this storm,” said NC Emergency Management Director Will Ray. “Please remain aware of hazards and follow directions from local officials to protect life and safety.”North Carolina residents should call 911 only for emergencies and dial 211 for other types of information. Up-to-date information on local conditions, shelters, traffic, power outages and resources is available at ReadyNC.gov and from county government social media.\n\nBuncombe County opens emergency shelter, family assistance center\n\nBuncombe County is opening two shelters at AB-Tech Asheville Campus in addition to the existing emergency shelter at the WNC Agriculture Center, currently at capacity.\n\nThe shelters will provide refuge for individuals displaced by Hurricane Helene. Everyone is welcome at the shelters, regardless of race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, or citizenship status, organizers say.\n\nThe two new shelters are located at AB Tech as follows:\n\nOvernight Emergency Shelter/General population shelter: AB Tech Conference Center, 16 Fernihurst Drive, Asheville, NC 28801. Use Victoria Road entrance.\n\nMedical Emergency Shelter for individuals dependent on equipment requiring power: 10 Genevieve Circle, Asheville, NC 28801\n\nWelcomed items are as follows:\n\n-Special items for children, like food/formula, diapers, extra clothing, toys, etc.\n\n-Prescription medications and medical devices\n\n-Comfort items like pillows, blankets, towels, change of clothing\n\nThe emergency shelter is staffed by a mixture of Red Cross and Buncombe County employees. Public health regulations do not permit pets in these two shelters. Emergency shelters for pets can be accessed at WNC Agriculture Center.\n\nNew form to report missing people\n\nThe Register of Deeds has developed a web-based form to assist people in finding and connecting with residents of Buncombe County.\n\nAnyone inside or outside of Buncombe County can use this to report someone who is missing or who cannot be reached. Access the Family Assistance Form directly here https://docs.google.com/.../1FAIpQLSeCZbJHoOE.../viewform....\n\nYou can also call 828-820-2761 and then listen to their message and then leave a message.\n\nAll information submitted will be reviewed by the Buncombe Search Team. The team will create and maintain a list of people who are currently unreachable and work with Buncombe County Emergency Operations Center to find information about their person.\n\n“We are committed to working tirelessly to connect people with their loved ones,” said Drew Reisinger, Buncombe County Register of Deeds.\n\nOfficials: 'Biblical devastation' leads to mounting fatalities\n\nThere have been \"multiple\" fatalities in Buncombe County as a result of Tropical Storm Helene, officials confirmed at a Sept. 28, 4 p.m. briefing, but officials did not provide an estimated count of those who have died.\n\n\"It is a catastrophic event, but now we are sad to report, it is a fatal event,\" Winston Parrish, senior pastor at Trinity Baptist Church and county sheriff's chaplain, said.\n\n\"Our emergency crews are not just conducting rescues at this time, but they are also recovering people who have perished in this tragedy. We know that this is just the beginning of what has been, and will continue to be, an awful and devastating natural disaster.\"\n\nBuncombe County Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole said the sheriff's department is working to compile a count of fatalities, \"and as we move forward we will try to have that information for the briefing from the sheriff's department.\"\n\nMore:Asheville, NC flooding: Multiple fatalities reported in Buncombe County, officials say; 'Biblical devastation'\n\n'Buncombe County's own Katrina': Family center to help connect families\n\nCity of Asheville and Buncombe County public officials have announced that they have been working on a service to help reconnect families as County Manager Avril Pinder called the disaster, “Buncombe County’s own Hurricane Katrina.”\n\nA family assistance center is being set up to help individuals find friends and family who may have been affected by the disaster. The Buncombe County Register of Deeds is leading the effort, where the county is encouraging those who wish to be reconnected with loved ones call 828-820-2761.\n\nIf you do reach your loved ones that are believed to be missing, the county encourages you to email buncombesearch@gmail.com, Pinder said.\n\n“Our emergency crews have been working nonstop,” Pinder said.\n\nThe emergency shelter for those who need emergency aid is located at 10 Genevieve Circle, Asheville, NC 28801.\n\nEmergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole said that call volumes for 911 are still very high, meaning a lot of emergency vehicles are still traveling the roadways. I-26 between Buncombe County and South Carolina has reopened as the only path for emergency resources to reach Buncombe County, Cole said.\n\n“Please do not drive unless you have to,” Cole said.\n\nThe county has performed over 150 swift water rescues, Cole said, noting that many mudslides are still occurring in the area. Cole called the flooding “biblical” in scale.\n\nFor those in the city of Asheville, a boil water advisory remains for all in the town who have water service, Assistant City Manager Ben Woody said.\n\nUpdates from UNC Asheville\n\nAccording to an alert sent from UNC Asheville's student alert system Sept. 28, classes are canceled until Oct. 9.\n\n\"Conditions at UNC Asheville are difficult,\" Chancellor Kimberly van Noort said in the alert. \"Significant tree damage has occurred, and parts of campus are inaccessible. Everyone is safe. Cell and internet coverage is nonexistent at this point ... We are providing security, food, water and comfort to the students remaining on campus.\"\n\nUNC Asheville spokesperson Michael Strysick told the Citizen Times Sept. 28 that approximately one quarter of students living on campus left before the storm, leaving around 1,200 still on campus. He said school staff went door-to-door after the storm performing checks on students.\n\nStrysick said UNC Asheville is coordinating with other UNC system schools and is looking into bringing mobile Wi-Fi to campus.\n\n\"We're doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,\" Strysick said.\n\nDowntown hotels are filling up\n\nNearly all downtown hotels are booked, and any with remaining availability have no running water and aren’t accepting more guests.\n\nJeff Elstro, the general manager of the Flat Iron Hotel, said the hotel has no water, no internet and is not taking guests. Yesterday, locals who went to the hotel searching for accommodations were unable to be helped. Most people at the hotel today are trying to leave, he said.\n\nJordan Hicks, a valet at the Restoration, said all 60 of the hotel’s rooms were full.\n\nOther hotels downtown, like the Haywood Park Hotel, have no vacancies or running water. The Downtown Inn and Suites was closed because it did not have water.\n\nThe Cambria Hotel Downtown Asheville, which posted on Facebook that it has a displacement rate for locals affected by Tropical Storm Helene, does not have rooms available.\n\nUpdates on I-26\n\nAccording to an update posted at an Asheville fire station, Interstate 26 has not opened in some areas past the Asheville Regional Airport. The update said there will be heavy traffic and road closures and the interstate should not be used \"unless it is an emergency and you have plenty of fuel.\"\n\nI-40 alternate route\n\nBuncombe County released an update from Highway Patrol shortly after noon on Sept. 28 asking drivers to use alternate routes that avoid Interstate 40 East.\n\nHighway Patrol is asking drivers to take I-40 to Interstate 240 to Interstate 26 if attempting to go south from Buncombe County.\n\nFor the most current road conditions, go to drivenc.gov.\n\nWidespread power outages persist\n\nMost people who went to bed Friday night with no electricity woke up Saturday still without power. And while Duke Energy has posted restoration times for some areas (one of which are in WNC), it's still a guess as to when power will be restored across the region. Duke Energy reports that more than 1 million customers are without power across North and South Carolina.\n\nBuncombe County was the hardest hit with power outages. At one point Friday, More than 200,000 Duke Energy customers were without electricity. That number dropped to around 100,000 Friday afternoon, and that hasn't changed much so far Saturday. Henderson County also was hit hard, with nearly 70,000 Duke customers without power.\n\nIn South Carolina, there are more than 230,000 Duke customers without power in Greenville County, more than 150,000 in Spartanburg County and almost 90,000 in Anderson County.\n\nHere are outage reports as of 11:30 a.m. Sept. 28 for WNC.\n\nDuke Energy customers without power\n\nAvery County: 805 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nBuncombe: 100,841 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nHaywood: 10,116 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nHenderson: 69,195 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nJackson: 9,642 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMacon: 8,188 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMadison: 404 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMcDowell: 19,739 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nMitchell: 4,700 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nPolk: 11,448 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nRutherford: 28,715 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nSwain: 840 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nTransylvania:13,937 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nYancey: 471 (repairs and damage assessment underway)\n\nFrench Broad EMC members without power\n\nBuncombe: 6,007\n\nMadison: 14,845\n\nMcDowell: 85\n\nMitchell: 5,575\n\nYancey: 13,863\n\nHaywood EMC members without power\n\nBuncombe: 2,522\n\nHaywood: 10,352\n\nJackson: 2,336\n\nMacon: 2,175\n\nTransylvania: 2,714\n\nAirlines mostly halted\n\nMost airlines are canceling flights today, according to a 10 a.m. update posted to the Asheville Regional Airport Facebook page Sept. 28.\n\nThe post said passengers should confirm their flight status with the airline before coming to the airport. Internet and phone service has been impacted by Helene. The airport is open and flights can take off and land, but the airport is facing \"operational difficulties\" due to the outages and staff being unable to get to work.\n\nSept. 28, morning update: No cellular coverage, rivers still at 'major flood status'\n\nThe morning after Tropical Storm Helene wreaked what Buncombe County has billed as a “catastrophic natural disaster,” dawned with all rivers still at “major flood status,” per an 8 a.m. news release from the county.\n\nSince Sept. 26, the county has received 5,566 911 calls and urged people not to call to report downed trees, power lines or outages.\n\nMore than 130 water rescue missions have been conducted.\n\n“I cannot stress enough how important it is to stay away from the water,” said Buncombe County Fire Marshal Kevin Tipton. “There are down power lines in the water, sewage in the water, and an incredible amount of debris. It is not safe.”\n\nThe 911 center will not provide updates on road conditions, power restoration or internet service, it said. I-40 and I-26 are impassable in multiple locations, and the county repeated a refrain from the day before: All roads in Western North Carolina should be considered closed.\n\nGo to drivenc.gov for current road conditions.\n\nLifesaving response continues to be the priority for emergency medical crews, according to the release, “however, they are beginning to triage other calls.”\n\nWhat about emergency shelter?\n\nThe emergency shelter at the WNC Agriculture Center in Fletcher is currently serving 400 people, with a capacity of about 500. An additional shelter at A-B Technical Community College will open as soon as roads into the location are passable, the county said.\n\nCellular coverage?\n\nBuncombe County remains without cellular coverage. There is no ETA for restoration, said the 9 a.m. release.\n\nWater outages?\n\nA late night update from the city, at around 9 p.m., said weather conditions have resulted in at least one significant water line break. As a result, customer in parts of the system are experiencing reduced or no water pressure.\n\nIt cautioned that fully restoring service to the water system will take “some time.”\n\n“Because large portions of the city are still underwater and many roads remain closed, Water Resources’ ability to assess the system is extremely limited. As a result you may experience low pressure or no water,” the news release said. “If you have water, but do not have the ability to boil it because of lack of electricity, please rely on bottled water for consumption.”\n\nBuncombe County has established a non-emergency line for community reports of things such as downed trees and debris at 828-250-6650.\n\nART service suspended\n\nA morning update from the city said Asheville Rides Transit bus services are suspended until further notice.\n\nInstead of regular route services, buses have been redirected to support relief efforts. ART was able to successfully transport over 578 individuals in need to shelters, the release said.\n\nCity buses were pulling away from the Harrah’s Cherokee Center shelter at around 7:30 p.m. Sept. 27, “special assignment” on the destination signs. Bikes sat in racks at the front of some of the buses.\n\nFrench Broad expected to crest at historic level tonight\n\nDuring the evening of Sept. 27, the French Broad River broke previous historic records set in the 1916 floods. The river nearly reached 25 feet in the late afternoon, breaking the July 16, 1916, record of 23.1 feet, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records. The river is expected to crest at 8 p.m.\n\nWestern North Carolina officials are calling the event the worst natural disaster of a lifetime.\n\nAt the same time, downtown Asheville seemed almost business as usual. Though the clutter of tree branches still sat on sidewalks, some bars were busy and overflowing onto the street. Some businesses have posted water outage notices, while others have closed their doors with darkened storefronts. Despite a 7:30 p.m. curfew, traffic lingered along Patton Avenue just 15 minutes before it.\n\nSocial media photos, videos show Helene's destruction\n\nAs Tropical Storm Helene rolled through North Carolina Friday, bringing heavy rains and floodwaters that will take days to recede, residents took to social media to document the destruction.\n\nThere were photos of people trying to escape from homes and videos of rivers overflowing their banks. Some areas weren't accessible Friday as the floodwaters continued to rise.\n\nMore than 3,349 calls to 911 in 10 hours\n\nAssistant Fire Chief Jeremy Knighton said the department is staffing over 200 firefighter who are actively “in the streets, rescuing our fellow community members.”\n\nCity and county officials encouraged people to text 911 if calls are not going through.\n\nBuncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole said crews are prioritizing “lifesaving missions.”\n\n“As calls come in for 911, we have to determine which have the highest priority,” he said. From 5 a.m. to 3 p.m., Sept. 27, he said the 911 call center received over 3,349 calls, where they were handling 9-10 calls per minute.\n\nMore than 130 swiftwater rescues have occurred since the beginning of the weather event.\n\n“We are unequivocally in the most significant natural disaster of our lifetime here in Buncombe County, and maybe in history,” Cole said.\n\nHe also acknowledged the “significant efforts” of first responders who have not stopped working for the last three days, and will keep going until the disaster is resolved, “which is not going to be anytime soon.”\n\n“This is something that we are going to be dealing with for many days and weeks to come. So please, be patient, work with us,” Cole said.\n\n“Do everything you can to look out for each other.”\n\nMore than 100,000 people remain without power due to downed trees and landslides, and there are more than 300 trees blocking roadways, said a 6 p.m. news release from the county.\n\nThe release said the new shelter, which county officials announced earlier was slated for A-Tech, was set to open Saturday, Sept. 28.\n\nDespite the rain clearing, flooding persists, the French Broad River has yet to crest.\n\nAny reported fatalities?\n\nBuncombe County officials said at the 4 p.m. briefing that they do not have a fatality count.\n\n“We have not gotten all our reports in from the field,” said Buncombe County Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole. “We are still looking at that information and will be compiling that. And once we get that compiled, once all notifications are made, then we will be able to look at that information and have that out.\"\n\nIn her opening remarks, Buncombe County Manager Avril Pinder referenced \"possible causalities,\" and said officials did not have total counts for casualties, injuries or damage to personal property.\n\nCurfew announced for Asheville, starts at 7:30 p.m.\n\nA curfew has been announced for the City of Asheville from 7:30 p.m.-7:30 a.m. beginning Friday and running nightly through Sept. 29 because most of the city remains without power, Asheville Police Department Chief Mike Lamb said during a joint conference with Buncombe County.\n\n\"So that's going to be from nightfall all the way until dawn,\" Lamb said.\n\nThere have been more than 60 water rescues as a result of flooding from Tropical Storm Helene, Buncombe County Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole said. Almost 200 firefighters are actively responding to calls across the city, Asheville Assistant Fire Chief Jeremy Knighton said during the conference.\n\nThe curfew is being enacted to help make sure residents don’t accidentally wander into rising waters, officials said. Intersections are also dangerous for travelers because of downed traffic signals, they said.\n\nThird emergency shelter to open in Buncombe County\n\nBuncombe County will open a third emergency shelter at Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College’s conference center, on Fernihurst Drive, County Manager Avril Pinder said at a 4 p.m. briefing livestreamed on Facebook.\n\nEmergency shelters were already established at the WNC Agriculture Center in Fletcher and at Harrah’s Cherokee Center in downtown Asheville.\n\nThere are more than 400 people at the Harrah’s, Pinder said, and it is close to reaching capacity. The Ag Center has about 150 people there now and a capacity of 500.\n\n“AB-Tech is being staffed up now. We don’t have power, as you know, so we’re working through what does that look like not to have power at a shelter,” Pinder said. It would also have a 500-person capacity.\n\nOfficials: Residents should heed evacuation orders\n\nThere are mandatory evacuations underway in several areas due to flooding.\n\nThese include:\n\nTransylvania County - Low lying areas in the town of Rosman around the French Broad River and the Davidson River Community will see door-to-door visits, advising residents of the need to evacuate now.\n\nBuncombe County - People between North Fork Road to Old U.S. 70, following the Swannanoa River all the way to Biltmore Village should evacuate.\n\nMcDowell County - River Breeze Campground on U.S. 221 Business North ordered to evacuate due to rising waters and flooding in the campground.\n\nMecklenburg County - Mandatory evacuation has been ordered for an area below the Catawba River below the Cowans Ford Dam.\n\nMore info and voluntary evacuation notices are posted on ReadyNC.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders.\n\nCell phones, wireless services down across state\n\nWireless services, including Verizon and Spectrum, are reporting outages across Western North Carolina.\n\n\"Hurricane Helene brought massive devastation throughout the area resulting in power outages and fiber damage from high winds, debris and flooding caused by the storm,\" Verizon Spokesperson Winnie Wright told the Citizen Times.\n\n\"In the Carolinas, customers are experiencing service impacts from Greenville, South Carolina up through Western North Carolina. Site repairs will begin as soon as it is safe to do so, with Verizon crews working around the clock to restore service as quickly as possible.\"\n\nInside Harrah Cherokee Center shelter: Survivor tales and a waiting game\n\nAt about 3 p.m., Harrah's Cherokee Center shelter staff – comprised of Asheville city staff and volunteers – were working to hand out food along with blankets, socks, boxers, sports bras and deodorant to the roughly 200-plus people sheltered inside the events center. Cell service was spotty inside.\n\nNear the entrance of the facility, father and daughter Phillip and Madison Donati were sitting with their cat, Bandit.The Donatis were staying the night at the Super 8 off of Tunnel Road headed toward Black Mountain when they woke up to a phone alert around 6 a.m., informing them that they would have to evacuate, Phillip Donati said.\n\nRecalling the evacuation on Asheville Rapid Transit buses, Phillip Donati said they watched as \"big trees\" floated in the Swannanoa River on the drive to the shelter, where they'd been since around 8 a.m. He called the experience \"kind-of aggravating.\"\n\n\"Not ideal, but under the circumstances you can't complain,\" Phillip Donati said of the shelter. They said they hoped to get back toward Black Mountain soon.\n\nSuper 8 employee Anthony Stephens said that the evacuation was \"scary,\" because some staying on the lower level of the motel woke up with \"two feet of water in their room.\"\n\nLeo Bell, who was evacuated from the Super 8, described half of the motel as \"inundated.\"\n\nSome trucks manned by the National Guard also came to evacuate people, Stephens said, noting that, \"It was scary when we saw the trucks outside and all of the people in the water.\"\n\nHelene gone, but threats persist\n\nThe National Weather Service said Helene passed most of the Western North Carolina area at 11:21 a.m., but significant impacts including serious flooding continue. The storm passed into Kentucky a little before 4 p.m. and was headed north northwest at about 28 miles per hour.\n\nWind gusts had peaked for the event over most of North Carolina, but the NWS warns that tropical storm force gusts will remain possible through through late-afternoon over the northern North Carolina mountains and on all ridgetops.\n\nLandslides could still occur across the mountains, particularly until the last of the rain tapers off this afternoon or evening.\n\nFEMA Urban Rescue Team and National Guard in Asheville\n\nThe National Guard and a FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team are now on the ground in Asheville, revealing how serious, potentially life-threatening Helene has been and will be as rivers continue to rise.\n\nCity of Asheville emergency responders and staff from each department continue life-saving efforts in response to the tropical storm, according to a 2:30 p.m. news release.\n\nCrews are responding to calls for assistance, including swift water rescues, evacuations, transportation to shelters and downed trees on powerlines, houses and roads. Asheville Fire Department has upscaled their operations with up to 200 firefighters filling emergency response roles.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency and the North Carolina National Guard are in town to assist rescue efforts. A FEMA Urban Search and Rescue team is in Asheville with 82 personnel and 19 vehicles, including buses, tractor trailers, box trucks, tow vehicles and rescue boats. The National Guard team is assisting by providing a team of eight personnel and high profile vehicles that can navigate through flooded waters.\n\n“Even though it may appear that the storm has passed, we want the community to understand that the devastating after effects of Helene, including rising rivers, downed powerlines and power outages, flooded roads, and damaged homes, will affect our community for days to come. The City of Asheville is dedicated to using all resources possible to continue to serve our community, businesses and visitors,” a statement read.\n\nFor non-emergency situations, call 828-250-6650. For life threatening situations, always call 911.\n\nInformation Sources:Find rolling storm related information on the homepage of the City of Asheville website.\n\n'Most significant natural disaster that any of us has ever seen'\n\nHundreds of thousands of people remain without power, hundreds of trees are down and it could be 24 hours before crews are able to get those trees removed, Buncombe County Emergency Services Assistant Director Ryan Cole said in a Friday briefing as Tropical Storm Helene lashed North Carolina.\n\n“Right now we are experiencing the most significant natural disaster that any of us has ever seen in Western North Carolina .... And with this historic flooding, it is going to reach above any record levels that we’ve ever had,\" Cole said.\n\nHe said they've had more than 50 swift water rescues throughout the county and are seeing support from across North Carolina and from other states, like Illinois and New Jersey.\n\nWater service advisory in Asheville\n\nThe city of Asheville has issued a water service advisory and announced that residents may experience periods of low water pressure and outages due to issues related to Tropical Storm Helene.\n\nResidents are encouraged to boil water if they intend to use it for drinking, food preparation or brushing teeth. Boiling water for one minute should kill any disease-causing organisms present in the water.\n\nCustomers without power are encouraged to use bottled water for these purposes.\n\nThe city is also urging residents to conserve water during this time.\n\nThe city of Hendersonville is asking residents to voluntarily reduce non-essential water use. The water treatment plant is \"currently operating, but intake capacity has been reduced, due to the Mills River intake being disabled by the storm,\" the city announced in a Friday news release. The city is working to restore the intake once crews can safely access the infrastructure.\n\nHendersonville is providing these tips to conserve water: Limit flushing of toilets by multiple usage; take shorter showers instead of baths; turn off taps when brushing teeth, shaving or washing dishes; fix any leaks immediately; limit cooking water; delay any washing of laundry and only run full loads of laundry; the use of flow-restrictive and water-saving devices is encouraged; and temporarily opt for biodegradable or disposable dishes/utensils.\n\nAsheville hotels offer shelter to displaced residents\n\nLooking for a place to stay but can't make it to the emergency shelter at Harrah's Cherokee Center Asheville, 87 Haywood St., in downtown Asheville? Explore Asheville has a list of businesses that are welcoming residents displaced by Hurricane Helene. Interested guests are asked to call directly and inquire about local booking and rates with the manager on duty. They may be asked for proof of residency at check-in.

When the river crests, estimated at about 8 p.m. on Friday, the flooding is expected to break all prior records in the town of about 8,100 people.\n\nBlakely encouraged residents to stay informed.\n\n\"There are certainly damages, certainly flooding at the park, certainly trees down and closed roads,\" Blakely said.\n\nThe closest emergency shelter to Fletcher is at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center, 1301 Fanning Bridge Road.\n\n'Active natural disaster' to last for days, officials warn\n\nRivers have not crested in Buncombe County, meaning the water is still rising along the Swannanoa River and French Broad River and poses an active threat to residents in those areas, county officials announced in a Friday news release.\n\nHere's when the rivers are expected to crest:\n\nWater will crest in Biltmore Village at about 2 p.m. at 27 feet\n\nSwannanoa River is expected to crest at 2 p.m. at 27 feet\n\nFrench Broad in Fletcher will crest at 8 p.m. at 30.5 feet\n\nFrench Broad in Asheville will crest at 8 p.m. at 23 feet\n\nBuncombe County officials say they do not expect waters to recede before Sept. 30, and warned residents that \"even as rain dissipates, this continues to be an active natural disaster.\"\n\nThey are urging people not to drive at this time.\n\nResidents fill downtown emergency shelter\n\nMore than 100 people had evacuated to the City of Asheville’s emergency shelter downtown at the Harrah’s Cherokee Center before noon on Friday.\n\nCity workers had been called in to assist and members of Buncombe County’s Community Paramedic initiative set up a station in the lobby to provide medical treatment. Around 11:30 a.m., community paramedics transported one evacuee to Mission Hospital.\n\nMichael Koon, 70, evacuated from ABCCM’s Veteran’s Restoration Quarters, which serves male veterans experiencing homelessness. An Asheville Rapid Transit bus picked up Koon and dozens of other veterans from the housing facility near the Swannanoa River in East Asheville, where Buncombe County officials ordered a mandatory evacuation in the early morning hours of Sept. 27.\n\nMore than 200 people were evacuated from the housing facility, according to Tim McElyea, ABCCM’s homeless services director. As of 12:30 p.m. on Friday, the site had not been impacted by flooding and it hadn't sustained any water damage, he told the Citizen Times.\n\nAvoid travel if possible, North Carolina Transportation officials say\n\nRoads are closed across Western North Carolina due to flooding, fallen trees, rockslides and mudslides.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation is asking motorists to avoid all travel in Western North Carolina, spokesperson Jen Goodwin said, noting that crews are responding but having difficulties with communication services and ongoing high winds. She suggested that those who have downed trees on NCDOT maintained roads call +1 (877) DOT-4YOU.\n\nBuncombe County Manager Avril Pinder said during an emergency news conference Friday that residents should consider \"all roads closed.\"\n\nHaywood County government officials said the same thing.\n\nAll lanes of I-40 at miler marker 67, near Old Fort Mountain east of Ridgecrest, are closed due to a rockslide. No injuries were reported. All lanes of I-26 at mile marker 51 in Henderson County are also closed, according to a Buncombe County news release.\n\nAll lanes of I-26 are closed south of Asheville between exits 44 and Exit 53 due to flooding. The road is expected to reopen by 2 p.m., according to DriveNC.gov. Goodwin said that many estimates for roads reopening \"are subject to change,\" as crews face rising waters and intermittent cell service. She encouraged residents to listen to local authorities on evacuation protocols.\n\nThe North Carolina Department of Transportation's road closures can be monitored live at https://drivenc.gov.\n\nEmergency shelters open\n\nEmergency shelters have been set up for residents who are unable to evacuate in some of North Carolina's hardest hit areas. Shelters are located at the WNC Agriculture Center located at WNC Agricultural Center: 1301 Fanning Bridge Road, Fletcher and the Harrah's Cherokee Center, 87 Haywood St., Asheville.\n\nThere are also Code Purple sheltering available through ABCCM for unhoused residents, and transportation on ART is free to Code Purple shelters.\n\nResidents should bring essential items such as medications, important documents and personal necessities, according to a news release.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders issued for areas of Buncombe County\n\nIn response to an escalating threat from Tropical Storm Helene, Buncombe County officials have issued an immediate and mandatory evacuation order for residents along the Swannanoa River beginning at the North Fork Reservoir, where waters have gone over the spillway. All residents in the following areas are required to evacuate: North Fork Road south to U.S. 70, U.S. 70 west to Old Farm School Road, Old Farm School to Azalea Road, Azalea Road to Swannanoa River Road and Swannanoa River Road to Biltmore Village.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were also issued for 105 Balsam Road from the Camp Ridgecrest for Girls south to U.S. 70 in Black Mountain due to the flooding of a lake at the camp.\n\nWhat to know about river flooding, advisories\n\nNOAA and USGS river gauges show flooding in WNC river basins. The flood stage begins at 9.5 feet, considered minor flooding. Moderate flooding begins at 13 feet and major flooding begins at 18 feet.\n\nFrench Broad at Asheville - 13.75 feet as of 7:45 a.m. Predicted to peak at 21 feet at 8 p.m.\n\nFrench Broad at Fletcher - 20.35 feet as of 8:15 a.m. Predicted to peak at a record-breaking 30.5 feet at 8 p.m.\n\nFrench Broad River near Marshall - 12.21 feet as of 8 a.m. Predicted to peak at 19 feet at 8 p.m.\n\nSwannanoa River at Biltmore - 17.72 feet as of 8:30 a.m. Predicted to peak at 21 feet at 2 p.m.\n\nFrench Broad River at Rosman (USGS) - 13.38 feet at 8:30 a.m.\n\nFlood advisories are active for the French Broad River at the following locations: Marshall affecting Madison County, near Hot Springs affecting Madison County, at Blantyre affecting Transylvania and Henderson Counties, at Asheville affecting Buncombe County and near Fletcher affecting Henderson and Buncombe Counties. There is also a flood advisory for the Swannanoa River at Biltmore affecting Buncombe County.\n\nThousands without power across the state\n\nAt the height of the storm in N.C., more than 450,000 in the state were without power.\n\nBuncombe County was particularly slammed, with more than 100,000 Duke Energy customers without power as of 8:30 a.m., while there were more than 63,000 Henderson County customers without power. Meanwhile, Haywood EMC reported more than 15,000 members were without power.\n\nThis story was updated to add new information and to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/12/28/four-days-learning-more-us-schools-consider-shorter-weeks/10956152002/", "title": "Four days of learning? More US schools consider shorter weeks", "text": "A school district in the Kansas City, Missouri, area could be the next large K-12 system to shorten its week to four days.\n\nSt. Joseph School District, which serves more than 10,000 students, including a growing English-language learner population, announced this week that it would be exploring a four-day school week. Officials hope the reduction, which wouldn’t take effect until the 2024-25 school year, would help address gaping staff vacancies, particularly in the English-Language Learner department, or ELL.\n\nThe move comes after board members of Independence School District, a school system east of Kansas City, voted 6-1 this month to adopt a four-day week. In doing so, Independence became the largest district in the state, serving roughly 14,000 students, to adopt the shortened schedule.\n\nHow much time do kids spend in school? It depends on where they live.\n\nWhat states have four-day school weeks?\n\nInstructional time policies often vary by district, but the four-day model is particularly pronounced in certain states, including those in the western region of the country and the South. Dozens of school districts in Texas have shortened their weeks.\n\nMore than a quarter of Missouri’s school districts had four-day weeks as of the start of the 2022-23 school year. The districts tend to be small and rural. The second-largest Missouri district with a four-day week, for example, serves just 3,000 students.\n\nFour-day weeks have been a relatively common – and often well received – format in small, rural districts since well before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBrookings Institute research shows they’ve grown in popularity over the past two decades. An analysis published shortly before the pandemic found at least 662 districts across two dozen states with four-day weeks.\n\nTeacher shortages fuel four-day school week\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated the four-day-week trend, particularly as schools grapple with teacher and support staff shortages.\n\nAccording to a federal survey in October, nearly half (45%) of public schools have at least one vacant teaching position, about the same rate as when the survey was done in January. Across the country, 4% of teaching positions remained vacant this fall, though the problem was pronounced in special education (7% of positions unfilled) and ELL programs (6%).\n\nBack in St. Joseph in Missouri, six of the more than 20 ELL teaching positions are vacant. Yet students learning English are the district’s fastest-growing group, from several hundred a decade ago to more than 1,000 today. Roughly three dozen languages are spoken, including Spanish, Chuukese and Burmese.\n\nOverworked, underpaid?:The toll of burnout is contributing to teacher shortages nationwide\n\nLearning loss affects these kids most:The teacher shortages are just piling on\n\nAre four-day weeks better?\n\nSt. Joseph School District’s next steps will involve lots of consultation with Independence officials as well as community members, said Gabe Edgar, St. Joseph’s superintendent.\n\nFrom a logistics standpoint, four-day weeks are appealing. Shortened weeks are often a strategy for recruiting and retaining teachers, particularly in rural and other hard-to-staff areas.\n\nThey can also help cut costs, particularly on electricity and other building expenses.\n\nThe consequences of four-day school weeks\n\nShortened school weeks can cause headaches for parents, from child care burdens to transportation problems. Many low-income families rely on schools to provide breakfast and lunch.\n\nThen there are the academic ramifications, of course. Research shows more high-quality instructional time is key to catching kids up from COVID-19-era learning disruptions.\n\nSome schools and districts try to compensate for the lost day with added hours to the other four days or other extracurricular opportunities. Still, one study found that on average students who attend them spend 85 fewer hours on instruction every year.\n\n\"The move to four-day school weeks is an unequivocally bad thing for kids and families,” Matt Kraft, an education researcher and professor at Brown University in Rhode Island who has studied instructional time, told USA TODAY earlier this year.\n\nEdgar said his end goal \"is to do what’s best for students.\" He said he’d rather “take a chance and fail than sit there and not do anything.”\n\n“Just try it and see if it happens. If it's good, it's good. If it's bad … we'll get back up and start over.”\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

Many were bused from the southern U.S. border by Republican governors and may not have connections in the city, immigrant advocates said. The flood of asylum seekers, along with a housing affordability and homelessness crisis decades in the making, are causing the city's shelter system to push past capacity, city officials and nonprofit staff say.\n\n\"I want to be honest with New Yorkers: You're going to see the visual of running out of room,\" Adams said in October. \"It's not if, it's when. People are going to be sleeping on our streets.\"\n\nSince July, 21,000 vacate notices have been issued to migrants in shelters − including families with children − because there's no more space, according to the mayor's office. Individual migrants get 30-day notices to leave shelters, and migrant families get 60-day notices. As summer turned to fall, and as fall has progressed, implementation of the policy has ramped up.\n\nThe new time limits on shelter stays break more than 40 years of a unique right to shelter in the city that policymakers and homeless advocates have long championed because it saves lives, they said.\n\nAmong migrants who have already received notices, 8,400 have notices that have expired, meaning their 30 or 60 days are up and they must leave the shelter, return to the migrant intake center and ask for another shelter room, which isn't guaranteed.\n\nThat process has already led to confusion and chaos, with some people thinking they would have to exit the shelter system for the streets, housing advocates told USA TODAY. Most people who reached the end of their time limit haven't returned to shelters, according to the mayor's office, and migrants without work authorizations won't be able to afford rent on their own.\n\nNew York City's sprawling shelter system meant the city's enormous homeless population was mostly indoors for years, somewhat hidden from the public and given much-needed shelter in dangerous weather conditions.\n\nNow, advocates are warning that could start to change quickly, just as winter descends on the Northeast.\n\n“People will be on the street. For the first time in almost 50 years, we will see children on the street. It is simply not acceptable,\" said Christine Quinn, CEO of the homeless shelter Win NYC and former speaker of the New York City Council.\n\nNew York City is 'too full'\n\nNonprofit staff and housing lawyers who spoke with USA TODAY said New York City officials have also been offering plane tickets to migrants who want to leave and settle elsewhere in the U.S.\n\nLast month, the Adams administration said social workers are tasked with asking migrants where they want to go and what they want to do in the U.S. so they can try to help them accomplish their goals.\n\nLaura Sumajjan, a mother of three from Colombia, was offered a ticket to Mississippi, she told USA TODAY. But she declined to leave New York City because she doesn't know anyone anywhere else and her kids are enrolled in school there.\n\nHer family has not yet received a 60-day notice to leave their shelter, but she has been learning about the new policy through social media and the news.\n\nShe said social workers didn't ask her what she wanted before offering her a chance to relocate again to Mississippi. They've also floated other, less-populated states, she said.\n\n\"They said New York is too full,\" Sumajjan, 28, said in an interview in Spanish. \"They haven’t asked me, it’s where they can offer help, not where we want to be.\"\n\nSumajjan came to the U.S. a year and a half ago, traversing through three Mexican cities before crossing the border near Mexicali and arriving in New York City via Ohio. She said she did it for her children, whom she wanted to have an American education.\n\n“Everyone deserves opportunities,” she said.\n\nWhat is New York's right-to-shelter mandate?\n\nFor more than four decades, New York City has sheltered tens of thousands of unhoused people in homeless shelters, unlike other major cities, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nIn the 1970s, before the legal right to shelter existed, many homeless New Yorkers (most of them men) died on the streets and suffered terrible injuries, according to the Coalition for the Homeless, a legal nonprofit that has advocated for unhoused people in the city for more than 40 years.\n\nIn 1979, a lawyer named Robert Hayes, who co-founded the coalition, filed a class action lawsuit against the city and New York state, arguing the legal right to shelter existed because the state Constitution declares \"the aid, care and support of the needy are public concerns and shall be provided by the state.\"\n\nBy 1981, New York City and the state agreed to provide shelter and board to all homeless men who \"met the need standard for welfare,\" the Coalition for the Homeless says. Over time, the mandate extended to women and families.\n\nNew York's homeless have long been 'hidden'\n\nNew York City, tied with Los Angeles County, has the largest unhoused population in the U.S., with more than 100,000 lacking permanent housing.\n\nThe vast majority of unhoused people in New York live in shelters, so compared with California and other Western states, \"the problem is hidden,\" said Margot Kushel, director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nIn California, more unhoused people live in tent encampments or in out-of-the-way places, along river beds or around floodplains. More people than ever are living in cars and vehicles in the Golden State, but that's not the case in New York City because of its unique lack of parking, Kushel said.\n\n\"Whatever unsheltered homelessness there will be will be very visible,\" Kushel said.\n\nEncampments and people forced to sleep on sidewalks could cause problems for local restaurants and business owners, as has been the case in California, she said.\n\nLast month, Adams said New York City will consider passing out tents to newly arrived migrants so they can live in parks and other outdoor spaces, The Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nWhen asked to confirm, the mayor's office said \"all options are on the table.\"\n\n“Passing out tents as winter approaches is not only a mockery of the city’s legal and moral obligation to provide safe shelter to people without homes, but it will put lives in danger,\" the Coalition for the Homeless said in a statement. \"People freezing to death on the streets is the exact nightmare that the right to shelter was designed to prevent.\"\n\nAdvocates warn homeless people could die on NYC streets\n\nThe Coalition for the Homeless and the city are tied up in legal talks over the shelter stay limits for migrants, in part because the 30- and 60-day limits are so arbitrary, said Will Watts, the coalition's deputy executive director for advocacy.\n\nThe mayor's office told USA TODAY they decided on the 30- and 60-day limits because that was the amount of time they felt gave migrants a chance to plan for the next steps in their journey.\n\n\"The analogy that came to mind was this is an eviction notice,\" Watts said. \"It just felt like, ‘I’m giving you a 30- or 60-day notice based on your tenancy.’”\n\nInternational arrivals have been an unfortunate \"scapegoat\" in the city's homelessness crisis in recent years, and the mayor's decision to limit their shelter stays places the stress of the crisis squarely on their shoulders, said Murad Awawdeh, executive director for the New York Immigration Coalition.\n\n“It’s a huge deal, it’s incredibly disingenuous for this administration to be going after the most marginalized and vulnerable members of our communities. That does not really foster New York values,\" he said.\n\nMigrants with nowhere else to go face the risk of getting frostbite on their extremities and freezing to death if they have to live on the streets, said Kushel, who is a physician. Unhoused people who live unsheltered are also at risk of getting hit by cars, especially at night, she said.\n\n\"We're heading into winter. That's not survivable,\" Kushel said. \"Like, we don't let our houses go down to 40 at night, because it would be dangerous.\"\n\nUnhoused people living outside are also at greater risk for violence and sexual assault, experts say. This year, researchers in Los Angeles found most unhoused women said feeling unsafe was their top concern while they lived on the streets.\n\n\"The data collected show that high rates of victimization and experiences of trauma are both a cause of homelessness and a common feature of women’s experiences of homelessness,\" says the report from the Urban Institute.\n\nIt's more costly to solve unsheltered homelessness, critics warn\n\nCities across the western U.S. have been struggling in recent years to solve their own homelessness crises, with many seeking to get unhoused people into shelter in temporary hotel programs or sanctioned encampments.\n\nThe cost of trying to solve unsheltered homelessness in New York City would be monumental, City Comptroller Brad Lander told USA TODAY, and the mayor's decision to limit shelter stays for migrants is a shortsighted fiscal solution that will cost more in the long term, he said.\n\n\"It's penny-wise and pound-foolish,\" Lander said. \"The costs of unsheltered homelessness ultimately show up in hospitals because sleeping on the street is terrible for your health. They show up in the corrections system because we have a program of homeless sweeps.\"\n\nLike in other cities, the relatively small number of unhoused people who live outdoors in New York face routine homeless sweeps by officials, in which people are moved from encampments to housing, shelter and sometimes jail.\n\nIn July, an audit by Lander's office found the city's homeless sweeps \"completely failed\" to help unhoused people. Among more than 2,300 unhoused people who were swept from New York streets in 2022, only three people secured permanent housing.\n\nSumajjan, from Colombia, said she tries to earn money from odd jobs, but all her cash ends up going to food, so she can't save money for an apartment.\n\nMeanwhile, she's waiting to possibly get a notice telling her the family has 60 days before they must leave their shelter in Queens.\n\nIf and when that notice comes, Sumajjan said, \"I am going to present myself again, because I have nowhere else to go.\"\n\nContributing: Melissa Montoya", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/06"}]}

The digital currency has doubled in value throughout 2024, hitting record highs as it neared $100,000 last month and surpassed the milestone for the first time on Thursday.\n\nHelping fuel the rally has been expectations that a second Trump Administration will create a conducive regulatory environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The latest sign is Trump's selection for Securities and Exchange Commission chairman: Paul Atkins, a crypto-friendly financier and a former SEC member.\n\nAll this momentum probably has investors wondering whether it is time to buy into Bitcoin.\n\n\"The current impressive run will inevitably attract new interest and a certain degree of FOMO (fear of missing out),\" Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory firm deVere Group, told USA TODAY in an email exchange.\n\nHoliday deals: Shop this season’s top products and sales curated by our editors.\n\nWhether you have invested in Bitcoin yet, it's safe to say \"that Bitcoin is undeniably now a global mainstream, legitimate asset class, evidenced by increasing levels of institutional interest,\" Green said.\n\nAnd you can invest – even if it's just a few bucks. Here's how.\n\nAs Bitcoin hits $100K, should I be investing?\n\nBitcoin had a rollercoaster of a day, topping $103,000, then dipping below $96,000 – and was up about 113% for the year as of late Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"People who are on the fence and maybe who are having fear of missing out and think they want to jump in and start investing now … may be wondering whether now is a good time to buy, or they should wait until the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin dips,\" NerdWallet personal finance expert Elizabeth Ayoola told USA TODAY.\n\nConventional wisdom is not to invest in something while it's at top value. But Bitcoin, Ayoola said, \"is volatile. So we don't know how much higher it will go.\"\n\nMany predict Bitcoin will continue to rise. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge and a former White House director of communications, has said Bitcoin could exceed $170,000 by mid-2025, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted Bitcoin will hit $1.48 million by 2030, Fortune reported.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank expects Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, Newsweek reported.\n\nWhile Bitcoin has a volatile history, it has become an asset many should consider investing in, Scaramucci said Thursday on CNBC.\n\n\"I do think it will be part of a long-term tactical asset allocation strategy, meaning portfolios will have one, two, three, 4% in Bitcoin,\" said Scaramucci, whose new book, The Little Book of Bitcoin, came out Thursday.\n\nBitcoin just hit $100,000:How high will it go in 2025?\n\nBitcoin price watch\n\nIf you are thinking of investing in Bitcoin, you could watch for an upcoming decline in its value. There were small declines in its value in the months of August, September and November.\n\nGreen expects to see a \"short-term sell-off\" as some investors bank profits. After that \"temporary pause,\" he expects Bitcoin to surge \"to hit $120,000 in the first quarter of 2025,\" he said in a note to investors Thursday.\n\n\"Naturally, it’s typically better to buy during a dip if it’s a genuine asset class, which Bitcoin is, rather than at the peak,\" Green told USA TODAY. \"This is standard investment practice.\"\n\nBitcoin is a slightly different type of asset in that it's digital. Its creator, a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto, designed Bitcoin to have a cap of 21 million bitcoin tokens.

You can buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange such as Binance.US, Coinbase or Kraken. You will create a \"crypto wallet\" to hold your fractional shares of the cryptocurrency. Unless you are investing in the $100K-range you are going to get a fraction of Bitcoin. The smallest share of each bitcoin is called a Satoshi – after the cryptocurrency's creator – equal to a hundred millionth of one bitcoin, according to NerdWallet. The smallest investment you can make on Coinbase is $1, according to NerdWallet. (However, with the 50-cent fee, you would only get about 50 cents in Bitcoin.)\n\nYou can buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange such as Binance.US, Coinbase or Kraken.

Familiar stockbrokers such as Fidelity and E-Trade, and trading apps like Robinhood, let you invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Here you can also get in at a low price; Robinhood, for instance, lets you buy a fraction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for as little as $1.\n\nFamiliar stockbrokers such as Fidelity and E-Trade, and trading apps like Robinhood, let you invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Here you can also get in at a low price; Robinhood, for instance, lets you buy a fraction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for as little as $1. Exchange-traded funds: These ETFs – approved by the SEC earlier this year – from investment firms such as Blackrock and Fidelity, another way you can invest in crypto, similar to how you buy stocks. And again you can invest as little or as much as you'd like.\n\n\"If you invest in a fund, it can make Bitcoin easier to buy and sell, and it also has better regulations,\" said Ayoola, adding that NerdWallet has many online resources for investors about Bitcoin. \"But if you buy directly from the exchange, you have direct ownership of your coins and aren't restricted to trading on traditional stock exchanges.\"\n\nIf you are going to invest in Bitcoin, consider it within your entire investment strategy – most finance experts recommend a diverse portfolio, with cryptocurrencies not accounting for more than 3%, Ayoola said. \"But if you have a higher tolerance for risk, then you may consider speaking with a finance expert before throwing your hard-earned cash into cryptocurrencies,\" she said. \"Bitcoin, is bullish right now, that doesn't mean that within the next week or month that your investment could not dip,\" Ayoola said. \"So you don't want to put money in there that you're going to need in the near future.\"\n\nWant a Bitcoin investment strategy? Try dollar-cost averaging.\n\nIdentify a set amount of money you can afford to invest in Bitcoin, then divvy that up and invest chunks at different time frames, regardless of the price. You could opt to invest even \"$50 and divide that by however many months you want to stretch it out to,\" Ayoola said.\n\nThe theory: \"the cost will average out over time,\" Ayoola said. \"That might be a way for people to still invest within their means, without putting too much in, and still basically, over time, get Bitcoin at the best price point.\"\n\nContributing: Daniel de Visé, Joey Garrison, Jessica Guynn, Max Hauptman, Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse and Bailey Schulz of USA TODAY, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The Trump family launched its own crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, in September.\n\nInvestors have wagered Trump's support for bitcoin and other digital assets will lead to fewer restrictions on the industry.

Here's some bitcoin basics.\n\nWhat is ‘Doge’?:Explaining the meme and cryptocurrency after Elon Musk's appointment to D.O.G.E.\n\nWhat is bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a digital asset, launched in 2009 by a person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto and designed to have a cap of 21 million bitcoin tokens.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted to allow the sale of bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, to the public.\n\nThat action allowed more investors to get into bitcoin in a similar manner to how they invest in stocks, bypassing crypto exchanges.\n\nHow does bitcoin work?\n\nLike the dollar, bitcoin can be used as currency, but it's virtual and isn't controlled by banks or governments. While an entire bitcoin is priced at nearly $100,000, you can own partial shares of each coin. The smallest share of each bitcoin is called a Satoshi – after the cryptocurrency's creator – equal to a hundred millionth of one bitcoin, according to NerdWallet.\n\nYou can buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange such as Binance.US, online stockbrokers including Fidelity and E-Trade, and trading apps like Robinhood.\n\nIf you buy bitcoin on a crypto exchange, you will create a \"crypto wallet\" to hold your bitcoin. If you invest in those bitcoin ETFs the SEC approved earlier this year, online brokers will hold your bitcoin in your brokerage account as any other investment.\n\nWhat can I buy with bitcoin?\n\nPretty much anything. For instance, you can get a bitcoin debit card, which you load with a certain amount of your cryptocurrency holdings. That can be used as you would any debit card.\n\nBeyond that, many companies now accept cryptocurrency for purchases including AT&T, Microsoft, Rolex, Time Inc., and Tesla, notes Investopedia.\n\nYou can buy \"art,\" too. That banana duct-taped to a wall, which sold last week for $6.2 million? The buyer paid in crypto.\n\nBitcoin:How to buy the cryptocurrency\n\nWhat concerns are there about bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?\n\nBack in 2018, investment guru Warren Buffett predicted that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, will likely \"come to a bad ending.\" His stance hasn't really changed, reported Nasdaq.com.\n\nBut many point to the surge in bitcoin's valuation as a sign the cryptocurrency has arrived. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of Skybridge and a former White House director of communications, has said Bitcoin could exceed $170,000 by mid-2025, and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has predicted Bitcoin will hit $1.48 million by 2030, Fortune reported.\n\nHowever, crypto exchanges can fail. The 2022 bankruptcy of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange resulted in customers losing $8 billion; founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March.\n\nBitcoin values dipped after that, but have since risen to new heights – because, supporters say, as more people invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the currencies become more stable.\n\nVolatility can be seen as an advantage for those in search of future earnings – or as a disadvantage for those seeking somewhat stable investments.\n\n\"Remember that bitcoin and crypto are highly volatile, and may be more susceptible to market manipulation than securities,\" notes Fidelity Investments in a primer for investors. \"Crypto holders do not benefit from the same regulatory protections applicable to registered securities, and the future regulatory environment for crypto is currently uncertain.\"\n\nMaybe think about investing in bitcoin as you would joining the wave of online bettors. \"If you decide to buy Bitcoin, it's a good rule of thumb to invest only what you can afford to lose,\" writes NerdWallet's Kevin Voigt, \"and take measures to protect your assets.\"\n\nContributing: Daniel de Visé, Jessica Guynn, Max Hauptman, Jonathan Limehouse and Bailey Schulz of USA TODAY, and Reuters.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Where Will It Go in 2025? | The Motley Fool", "text": "Anders Bylund\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nThe oldest and largest cryptocurrency took a history-making step on Wednesday evening. After getting close and moving back a few times, Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) finally crossed the $100,000 price point for the first time.\n\nHow important is this milestone for Bitcoin and its investors, and where will the leading cryptocurrency go from here?\n\nLet's think about that for a minute.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nBitcoin had been hanging around just below $100,000 for a while. The coin rose above $99,340 on Nov. 22, retreated below $91,300 over the next week, and then bounced between $45,000 and $98,000 for a few days.\n\nWednesday's surge started around noon ET. Rising from a 24-hour low of roughly $94,800, the coin reached a $98,000 plateau four hours later. Near 9:30 p.m. ET, one of my market-tracking apps buzzed in my pocket, saying that Bitcoin was nearing the $99,000 level. Less than 10 minutes after that, I watched a live Bitcoin price tracker skip from a bunch of 9s to just above the legendary $100,000 mark.\n\nThe surge didn't stop there, and Bitcoin rose above $102,000 while I wrote the paragraphs above. Time flies when you're having fun in the crypto space.\n\nAs for the reasons behind this sudden spike, Bitcoin investors lionized the incoming Trump administration's nominee to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler hasn't provided much support to the crypto industry, but he recently preannounced his January resignation. On Wednesday evening, President-elect Trump said he wants the crypto-friendly Paul Atkins to take Gensler's seat. Bitcoin didn't immediately soar when the Atkins pick was published, giving investors a few hours to mull over the implications of the Atkins pick.\n\nHow Atkins and the SEC fit into the Bitcoin puzzle\n\nThe SEC chair doesn't hold absolute power over how Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be regulated. But this officer can steer the SEC in a certain direction, and Atkins certainly looks like a more crypto-friendly regulator than Gensler.\n\nAtkins has said that the SEC should \"update its regulations concerning custody of digital assets,\" using stronger tools than mere guidelines in staff accounting bulletins. He is also a well-known proponent of free market forces, often suggesting that the government should play a very limited role in how people and companies manage their assets -- including cryptocurrencies.\n\nSo the bullish market reaction to this nomination makes a lot of sense. It remains to be seen whether Atkins is confirmed to this post and how his SEC leadership works out in the real world, but his presence seems to have some upside for crypto investors.\n\nWhy is Bitcoin going up?\n\nZooming out from Wednesday's big benchmark, Bitcoin has several potentially price-boosting catalysts in play right now:\n\nThe fourth halving of Bitcoin mining rewards took place last April, fundamentally changing the economics of Bitcoin production. History doesn't repeat itself, but the first three halvings led to substantial price increases over the next year to year and a half. This effect isn't random, since it springs from a changing calculus of fixed production costs resulting in fewer new Bitcoins. There's no reason why the fourth halving cycle should be materially different from its predecessors.\n\nThe SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. The move was made after years of ETF applications and lobbying -- a process that probably would have moved faster under a more crypto-friendly SEC board. These funds give investors a new way to approach cryptocurrencies by means of a stock-like instrument in a standard stock brokerage account. So far, these funds manage more than $104 billion of actual Bitcoin holdings. New funds have been flowing into the leading iShares Bitcoin ETF over the last month, and the Atkins nomination could spark another wave of investor dollars moving into the crypto space this way. From retirement accounts to massive institutional investors, whole new investor classes suddenly have the option to make pretty direct Bitcoin investments with spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nover the last month, and the Atkins nomination could spark another wave of investor dollars moving into the crypto space this way. From retirement accounts to massive institutional investors, whole new investor classes suddenly have the option to make pretty direct Bitcoin investments with spot Bitcoin ETFs. There's more and more crypto chatter in the media. The rising scrutiny and attention should only grow more intense as the other price-aiding catalysts play out in 2025 and beyond. Crypto is going mainstream, and digital coins might soon reach a critical mass where it makes sense to use them for everyday tasks. I haven't paid for milk and eggs in Bitcoin yet, and maybe I never will -- this currency was designed for long-term value storage rather than quick in-store transactions, after all. But other cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance apps could become the next bog-standard payment system, with positive implications for the entire crypto sector. Active use is how cryptocurrencies -- or any other asset -- really builds value in the long run.\n\nLong story short, Bitcoin has plenty of fuel for a potential bull run in 2025. The incoming SEC leader may add weight to the upward momentum but he isn't the whole story. Likewise, this week's passing of the $100,000 waypost is a unique moment in Bitcoin's history, but it's also just another step in a long journey.\n\nShould I buy Bitcoin?\n\nFor these reasons, I think it's a good idea to have some exposure to Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies right now. You can start a crypto brokerage account and grab the real thing, or take the alternate route through ETF shares.\n\nEither way, crypto assets look ready to play a supporting part in any properly diversified portfolio.

But the worst may be over ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTarget just demonstrated how quickly things can change in the world of retail, posting a terrible quarter after nearly two years of soaring profits and record revenue growth. But the big box retailer is promising things will change in the other direction just as fast.\n\nTarget was widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic, gaining new customers as shoppers not wanting to go into brick-and-mortar stores were drawn to its growing curbside pickup and home delivery.\n\nBut after a disappointing fiscal first quarter when profits fell 40%, Target just had an even worse second quarter. Profits plunged 90% compared to a year earlier.\n\nInflation-weary shoppers shifted to buying essentials such as food and gas rather than “nonessential” general merchandise that is central to Target’s sales and profits. It was a stark contrast to larger rival Walmart (WMT), which posted only a narrow drop in profits for the quarter.\n\nBut many analysts believe Target is still in good position going forward, that it’s not at risk of joining some of the other pandemic winners who are now struggling, like online retailer Wayfair (W). Friday it announced it had to cut 5% of the staff due to expanding too fast during the good times.\n\nTarget’s profit plunge came from the deep discounts it had to offer on much of its general merchandise, such as clothing, electronics and home goods. The hit to earnings from such deep discounting was unavoidable. But company executives insist it was the right choice.\n\n“Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time,” said CEO Brian Cornell to investors. “The vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us.” He predicts a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season.\n\nMany analysts agree that Target did the right thing taking the hit. Several say the sudden shift in consumer buying habits was not the fault of miscalculation by management.\n\n“All last year the supply chain was very, very tight. Stores were out of stock of many items. They were ordering for a level of demand that was very reasonable,” said Bobby Griffin, retail analyst at Raymond James. “Then there was a very fast change in consumer behavior.”\n\nDiscretionary purchases being made by consumers shifted away from goods to things like travel, Griffin said.\n\nOther experts say that Target management wasn’t quite blameless for being caught with too much of the wrong inventory.\n\n“My sense is that this [problem at Target] was 70% about consumer behavior and 30% miscalculation related to inventory,” said Eric Schiffer, chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm, The Patriarch Organization.\n\nThere is some hope for all retailers that they could benefit from the large, steady decline in gas prices over the last two months.\n\nThe national average price of gasoline has dropped $1.11, or 22% to $3.91 since hitting a record of $5.02 on June 14. It has fallen every day since. That should save households $100 a month on average. And wholesale gasoline futures point to even lower gas prices ahead in the coming weeks and months.\n\nTarget was always going to have more problems with a sudden shift in consumer spending than Walmart. Walmart has more than half of its sales from grocery while Target is closer to 20% said Owen Chen, retail analyst at Cowen. Walmart also had to offer sales on its nonessential general merchandise in the quarter.\n\nAnd Walmart has always competed more on low prices, an advantage at a time that even middle and higher income shoppers are concerned about higher prices. Walmart executives reported it saw more business from those upper income households in the most recent quarter, a statement that cheered its investors.\n\nBut Chen said the numbers indicate that they did not get those higher income shoppers from Target’s traditional customers.\n\n“I think that Target’s [store] traffic numbers show it did a good job holding onto their customers,” he said. The number of customers making purchases at Target was up 2.7% compared to a year ago in the just-completed quarter. And that’s more than a 20% increase since the same period of 2019, ahead of the pandemic.\n\nTarget shares have underperformed some of its rivals, falling 28% so far this year, compared to only a 5% decline at Walmart. Schiffer said he wouldn’t be surprised to see the slide in Target shares continue, as he believes they are overvalued by as much as 30%. But he doesn’t think that means Target is badly positioned for the future.\n\n“I would stay the course,” he said. “The pace of growth during the pandemic was never going to be sustainable. They’ll still grow, just not as fast.”", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/business/uk-nurses-strike-thursday-nhs-gbr-intl/index.html", "title": "British nurses launch historic strike, as pay and staffing crises ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nNurses across much of the UK launched a historic strike on Thursday, as they walked out of hospitals and onto picket lines after several years of falling pay and declining standards left the country’s nationalized health care system in a state of crisis.\n\nAs many as 100,000 members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) – the UK’s biggest nursing union – are taking industrial action in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, in the latest and most unprecedented of a wave of strikes that has swept Britain this winter. It is the largest strike in the RCN’s 106-year history.\n\nBut it comes after several years of hardship for employees of Britain’s National Health Service (NHS), a revered but beleaguered institution that is straining due to staffing shortfalls, sky-high demand and stretched funding.\n\n“I went into nursing to care for patients, and over the years my capacity to provide the level of care my patients deserve has been compromised,” Andrea Mackay, who has worked as a nurse for seven years at a hospital in southwest England, told CNN on her reasons for striking Thursday.\n\n“The reality is, every day, nurses across the UK are walking into understaffed hospitals,” Mackay said. “The NHS has been running on the compassion and goodwill of nurses for years … It is unsustainable.”\n\n“It’s about paying staff what they’re worth so they can pay the bills,” Jessie Collins, a pediatric nurse preparing to join the strike, told CNN, adding that staffing pressures have crippled the emergency department she regularly works in. “During one of my worst shifts I was the only nurse to 28 unwell children … it’s not safe and we cannot deliver the care that these children need at times,” she said.\n\nPamela Jones, on the picket line outside Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, told PA Media: “I’m striking today because I’ve been nursing for 32 years; within those 32 years the changes have been astronomical.\n\n“I feel really sorry for the young girls who are now trying to get into the profession, they have to pay for their training. The public need to understand the pressures that everyone’s under. You’ve only got to come into A&E and see the queues, there’s no beds.\n\n“We want to save our NHS, we don’t want it to go, and I think this is the way forward, it’s the only way we can put our point across. We don’t want to be here. I was really torn about striking because it’s not something I’ve ever, ever thought in my lifetime I’d ever had to do, but yet the government has pushed us to this.”\n\nShe added: “I hope the government listens, because none of us want to be here, we just want a fair pay rise.”\n\nEmma Sudol, a nurse at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, told PA Media how since she qualified three years ago the situation had worsened and described the working conditions in her department as “scary” and “dangerous” for both staff and patients.\n\n“It’s definitely scary. It’s scary for us because our registrations are on the line and we’re being put in a position where it isn’t safe,” Ms. Sudol said.\n\n“We can’t give the care we want to, or should be giving, and I feel like it’s dangerous for us and it’s dangerous for the public.\n\n“Because of the conditions, more people are leaving nursing and they’re not replacing them, so the problem is snowballing.”\n\nThe NHS has come under increasing pressure in recent years. Victoria Jones/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nYears of disputes\n\nThe strike is taking place on two days – Thursday and next Tuesday – and not every NHS Trust will take part. But it marks one of the most dramatic uses of industrial action in the 74-year history of the NHS, and has intensified debate over the state of Britain’s public services.\n\nThe RCN is calling for a pay rise of 5% above retail inflation, which on current figures amounts to a 19% hike, and for the government to fill a record number of staff vacancies that, it argues, is jeopardizing patient safety. Steve Barclay, the UK’s health secretary, told CNN in a statement earlier this week that their demand is “not affordable.”\n\nThe standoff follows years of disputes over the level of pay for NHS employees. Nurses’ pay dropped 1.2% every year between 2010 and 2017 once inflation was taken into account, according to the Health Foundation, a UK charity that campaigns for better health and health care. For the first three of those years, their pay was frozen.\n\nThe number of patients waiting for care has meanwhile sky-rocketed, a years-long trend that has been exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nA record 7.2 million people in England – more than one in eight residents – are currently waiting for treatment, according to the British Medical Association. Seven years ago, the figure was 3.3 million.\n\n“I work alongside some amazing (nurses) who have come in early, left late, worked through breaks and lunch, agreed to come in on their days off for an overtime shift to make sure their patients are kept as safe as we can manage,” Mackay told CNN.\n\n“I don’t have all the answers and I understand that there is a limit to the money available, but unless the government prioritize health, patient safety, (and) strengthening the workforce then the NHS is going to collapse,” she said.\n\nThe NHS, which is free at the point of care, forms a central part of Britain’s national psyche and third rail of the country’s politics. During the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of Britons stood outside their homes to applaud NHS workers, in a weekly ritual championed by the government.\n\nBut that has since been criticized as an empty gesture by disgruntled employees, who say the government’s pay offers to staff have not represented the same spirit.\n\nBritons applauded NHS workers during the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. Christopher Furlong/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this year, the RCN rejected an offer by the government to increase nurses’ pay by a minimum of £1,400 ($1,707) a year, which amounted to an average rise of 4.3%, well below the rate of inflation.\n\n“I have nursed patients who can remember life before the NHS. They know how precious it is because they have seen what went before,” Mackay said.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer attacked Rishi Sunak on the strike during Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, telling him that “the whole country would breathe a sigh of relief” if he halted the strike by striking a deal with the RCN.\n\nThe industrial action was a “a badge of shame for this government,” Starmer said.\n\nA winter of discontent\n\nMost of the nurses taking part in Thursday’s action will be striking for the first time in their lives. But they are joining workers across Britain’s public services in walking out of work and demanding increased pay and conditions, furthering a swelling tide of strikes unlike any seen in the UK for decades.\n\nEmployees on Britain’s railways, buses, highways and borders are taking industrial action this month, bringing various forms of travel essentially to a standstill. Teachers, postal workers, baggage handlers and paramedics are all also due to strike in December.\n\nIt has left the government scrambling to respond. Members of Britain’s armed forces were being trained to drive ambulances and firefight in the event of strike action, ministers said earlier this month. On Tuesday, the Police Federation said it opposed a request to have police officers drive ambulances.\n\nAnd unions have threatened more action in the New Year, when a cost-of-living crisis that has clouded Britain in recent months is expected to worsen still.\n\nA total of 417,000 working days were lost to strikes in October, the most recent month for which figures are available, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is the highest number for any month since 2011.\n\nThe impact of those strikes has led parts of the British media to rekindle memories of the so-called Winter of Discontent in 1978 and 1979, when demonstrations brought the UK to a standstill – though this year’s level of industrial action constitutes a fraction of those months, where several million working days were lost.\n\nSunak has been accused by opposition parties of refusing to negotiate with unions in good faith, and not doing enough to prevent strikes from going ahead.\n\nBut the ongoing disputes are a thorny issue for both major parties. Labour – a party with strong historic links to trades unions – has been walking a tightrope, urging the government to do more but refusing to explicitly support the demands of picketers.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/12/15"}]}

It usually doesn't happen unless there is major fear or concern that the stability of the country is apparent,\" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.\n\n\"When there is chaos in Asia, it makes a lot of sense for jumping to the yen and a lot of the funds that are usually invested in Korea start actually heading towards Japan and I think already you're seeing a bit of an unusual jump in favor of the yen.\"\n\nThe dollar fell 0.3% versus the yen to 149.12 yen , while the euro also dipped, down 0.2% at 156.77 yen . Traders are growing increasingly confident that Japan may hike interest rates this month.\n\nThe won sank to its lowest since May 2023 against the yen, and was last down 2.2% at 1,043 won .\n\nThe euro , which had been the weakest G10 currency through November, began this month with a 0.7% fall on Monday and was last up 0.2% at $1.05185, as France's government heads for collapse over a budget impasse. EUR/GVD\n\nFrench Prime Minister Michel Barnier faces a vote of no confidence on Wednesday after fierce opposition from across the political spectrum to his budget, which contains painful tax rises and spending cuts aimed at repairing the country's precarious finances.\n\nDemand for hedges, as reflected by euro options volatility, has hit its highest since March 2023 this week and, with the combination of a string of weak data, political uncertainty in major euro zone economies and the seemingly unstoppable dollar, the single European currency could struggle.\n\nWatching the Yuan\n\nThe Chinese yuan, another currency to watch with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump in the United States, hit a 13-month low on tariff risks and weakness in China's economy.\n\nThe yuan had already sold off in anticipation of more tariffs from Trump and improving U.S. manufacturing data, and a dive in Chinese bond yields to record lows has pulled the currency towards 7.3 per dollar for the first time since last November.\n\nChina fixed the yuan's trading band at its weakest in more than a year and traders ran with it to sell the currency at 7.2996 per dollar. The Chinese unit last traded at 7.2850 per dollar, slightly down 0.2%. It traded at 7.24 on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index was little changed to slightly down on the day at 106.34 . It trimmed losses after data showed job openings, a measure of labor demand, had risen 372,000 to 7.744 million by the last day of October, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said in its Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS report.\n\n\"The Fed's December 18th decision will be a close one, but if the majority of voting members prioritize the employment mandate, markets should expect a cut in policy rates, supporting risk appetite,\" wrote Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in emailed comments.\n\nU.S. fed funds futures priced in a 70% chance of a 25 basis-point cut this month, and 30% odds of a pause, according to LSEG calculations, little changed from late Monday.\n\nThe dollar typically suffers seasonal weakness in December as companies tend to buy foreign currencies. However, traders are keeping a wary eye this year on Trump's incoming government and its support of the greenback.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump threatened punitive tariffs unless BRICS member countries committed to the dollar as a reserve currency.\n\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss in New York and Amanda Cooper in London; Additional reporting by Pranav Kashyap in Bengalaru and Tom Westbrook in Singapore; Editing by Nicholas Yong, Kirsten Donovan and Susan Fenton", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/12/04/south-korea-martial-law-trump-cabinet-transgender-hannah-kobayashi-college-football-biden/76757982007/", "title": "South Korea, martial law, Biden, Trump, transgender, Hannah ...", "text": "A declaration of martial law in South Korea triggered a political crisis for the major U.S. ally.

He had been in Maldives for just over 24 hours after fleeing Sri Lanka’s commercial capital on Wednesday – the same day he was meant to resign after he pledged to step down following huge protests against his rule at the weekend.\n\nSingapore confirmed that Rajapaksa had landed and been allowed to enter the country on a “private visit” but had not asked for or been granted asylum.\n\nRajapaksa then tendered his resignation in a letter sent by email to parliamentary speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardenena, according to the speaker’s office, though the office also cautioned “we cannot accept such an email at face value.”\n\nHere’s what we know.\n\nSri Lankan protesters chant slogans after taking control of the Prime Minister's office in Colombo on July 13. Abhishek Chinnappa/Getty Images\n\nWhere is the president?\n\nRajapaksa had been expected to resign on Wednesday, clearing the way for new leadership. Instead he and his wife boarded a military plane in the early hours of Wednesday and fled from Colombo to Maldives.\n\nThe plane had been refused permission to land in Maldives until former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed – now speaker of the Maldivian Parliament – intervened, according to a high-ranking security official. A spokesperson for Nasheed did not confirm or deny the intervention.\n\nMaldives and Sri Lanka are close neighbors – the Maldivian capital Male is just a 90-minute flight from Colombo. And Nasheed and the Rajapaksas have a history of cooperation. In 2012, amid anti-government protests in the Maldives, Nasheed and his wife sought political shelter in Sri Lanka, then led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the current president’s brother.\n\nThe Maldivian governmentdidn’t confirm Rajapaksa’s presence in the country, but Sri Lankans living in Maldives took to the streets of Male anyway on Wednesday to protest his reported arrival.\n\nPhotos from the Maldives capital show a crowd of people holding the Sri Lanka flag, and signs reading: “Throw him out here” and “Dear Maldivian friends, please urge your government not to safeguard criminals.”\n\nSri Lankans living in Maldives stage a demonstration in Male on July 13. AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Thursday, Rajapaksa left Maldives for the Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore, a senior military source familiar with the matter told CNN. The president left on a “Saudi flight,” the source said.\n\nCNN believes the source was referring to Saudia flight 788, which left Male at 11:30 a.m. local time Thursday. Saudia is the flag carrier of Saudi Arabia. CNN has reached out to Saudia but has not heard back.\n\nRajapaksa landed in Singapore later on Thursday, and its Foreign Ministry released a statement that read: “It is confirmed that Mr. Rajapaksa has been allowed entry into Singapore on a private visit. He has not asked for asylum and neither has he been granted any asylum. Singapore generally does not grant requests for asylum.”\n\nA Saudia airline Boeing 787 Dreamliner believed to be carrying Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa arrives at Changi Airport in Singapore on July 14. Roslan Rahman/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIs Rajapaksa still the president?\n\nSri Lanka’s parliamentary speaker, Abeywardenena, has received an email with Rajapaksa’s resignation, the speaker’s office confirmed to CNN Thursday, but added that the “legality of it needs to be ascertained.”\n\nIt has been shared with the relevant authorities for the verification of the same,” the office said. “Once we have official confirmation and it is legally verified, we hope to make a statement regarding it tomorrow [Friday] morning.”\n\nAbeywardenena’s office added that it is expecting to receive a paper copy of the letter, but that would take longer as it would be sent from Singapore.\n\nRajapaksa’s resignation would only be considered official once the speaker receives a letter of resignation, according to the country’s constitution.\n\nA new president was set to be elected on July 20 after the resumption of parliament on July 16 – though that timeline is now on hold.\n\nRajapaksa’s departure is a historic moment for the island nation, which his family had ruled with an iron fist for much of the past two decades before losing the faith of their once adoring citizens.\n\nSri Lankan protesters occupy the prime minister's office in Colombo on July 13. Tharaka Basnayaka/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nWhat’s going on with the protests?\n\nColombo appeared calm on Thursday after several days of escalating protests, with a curfew declared from noon until 5 a.m. on Friday.\n\nLast weekend’s demonstrations were among the most dramatic seen so far, with protesters setting fire to Wickremesinghe’s private residence in an affluent neighborhood, and swimming in Rajapaksa’s private pool.\n\nOn Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators broke into the compound of the prime minister’s office in Colombo following a standoff with armed police. Protesters also entered the premises of state broadcaster Sri Lanka Rupavahini.\n\nA protester runs for cover from a tear gas canister during a protest in Colombo, Sri Lanka, on July 13.

Some flooded out onto the balconies and flung open windows, raising their fists at the crowd gathered below.\n\nPolice responded with tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds. Photos show protesters covering their faces with face masks, bandannas and plastic goggles; some picked up tear gas canisters to throw back toward police.\n\nAt least 75 people were injured during the protests Wednesday, according to the National Hospital in Colombo. Many people were brought in due to tear gas inhalation, others with cuts and bruises likely from trying to jump over fences, according to a nurse at the hospital.\n\nOne police officer was seriously injured during the protests Wednesday and was rushed to hospital where he was receiving treatment, Sri Lankan police said Thursday. An army sergeant was also injured in scuffles with protesters, police added.\n\nDuring this incident, protesters took a T-56 rifle and two clips of live ammunition, containing 60 rounds each, police said. Police were looking for the service weapon and ammunition to bring it back into police custody.\n\nAs the demonstrations escalated, Wickremesinghe’s office declared a state of emergency – later canceled – and a nighttime curfew. He also appointed a committee of senior armed forces commanders to coordinate ground troops across Sri Lanka, and to “restore law and order.”\n\nWhat caused the crisis?\n\nSri Lanka, located just off the coast of India, has been rocked by ongoing protests for months over its worst financial crisis in seven decades.\n\nThe country’s foreign exchange reserves plummeted to record lows, with dollars running out to pay for essential imports including food, medicine and fuel – leaving millions unable to feed their families, fuel their cars or access basic medicine.\n\nFrequent and largely peaceful protests have been held since March, with rising public anger over food costs, electricity cuts, and the government’s handling of the crisis. Protesters have demanded the resignations of both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe.\n\nThe crisis has been years in the making, said experts, who point to a series of government decisions that compounded external shocks.\n\nOver the past decade, the Sri Lankan government has borrowed vast sums of money from foreign lenders to fund public services, said Murtaza Jafferjee, chair of Colombo-based think tank Advocata Institute.\n\nThis borrowing spree coincided with a series of blows to the Sri Lankan economy, from both natural disasters like monsoons and man-made catastrophes, including a government ban on chemical fertilizers that decimated farmers’ harvests.\n\nFacing a massive deficit, Rajapaksa slashed taxes in a doomed attempt to stimulate the economy. But the move backfired, instead hitting government revenue. That prompted rating agencies to downgrade Sri Lanka to near default levels, meaning the country lost access to overseas markets.\n\nSri Lanka then had to fall back on its foreign exchange reserves to pay off government debt, shrinking its reserves. This impacted imports of fuel and other essentials, which sent prices soaring.\n\nTopping all that, the government in March floated the Sri Lankan rupee – meaning its price was determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange markets. However, the plunging of the rupee against the US dollar only made things worse for ordinary Sri Lankans.", "authors": ["Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/americas/peru-president-castillo-congress-dissolves-intl/index.html", "title": "Peru's President impeached and arrested after he attempts to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDina Boluarte became Peru’s first female President on Wednesday, capping off a dramatic day which saw her predecessor arrested for the alleged crime of rebellion and impeached by lawmakers.\n\nBoluarte, the country’s former vice president, was sworn into the top job at Congress to become Peru’s sixth President in under five years.\n\nThe ceremony took place hours after a majority of 101 members in the 130-person legislative body voted to impeach former leader Pedro Castillo.\n\nThe tumultuous day began when then-President Castillo announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government, ahead of a looming impeachment vote by lawmakers, which Peru’s Ombudsman described as an “attempted coup d’état.”\n\nHe also called for parliamentary elections to work on a new constitution.\n\nThe move prompted a string of cabinet resignations, fiery reactions from top officials and condemnation from regional neighbors – and ultimately failed to prevent his impeachment in Congress.\n\nPeruvian armed forces rejected Castillo’s attempt to sideline lawmakers, calling it an “infringement of the constitution.”\n\nAnd Boluarte herself criticized Castillo’s dissolution plan, describing it on Twitter as “a coup that aggravates the political and institutional crisis that Peruvian society will have to overcome with strict adherence to the law.”\n\nCastillo was detained in Lima Prefecture on Wednesday. Fuente con acceso al caso\n\nInternational officials joined the chorus of condemnations of Castillo, with the United States urging the leader to “reverse” the move and “allow Peru’s democratic institutions to function according to the Constitution,” US Ambassador in Peru Lisa Kenna said on Twitter.\n\n“We will continue to stand against and to categorically reject any acts that contradict Peru’s constitution, any act that undermines democracy in that country,” said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price in a statement.\n\nArgentina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed “deep concern” over Peru’s political crisis in a statement on Twitter, and Brazil’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Castillo’s actions were “incompatible with the constitutional framework of that country, [and] represent a violation of democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nIn a stunning turn of events, Castillo was detained by police in the capital city Lima after lawmakers impeached him in Congress.\n\nPeru's Dina Boluarte is sworn in as President in Lima on December 7, 2022. Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters\n\nImages shared from the prefecture showed the former President, wearing a blue jacket, sat around a table while officials signed documents.\n\nIn a statement, the office of Peru’s Attorney General said Castillo had been arrested for the alleged crime of rebellion, “for violating the constitutional order.”\n\n“We condemn the breach of the constitutional order,” Peru’s Attorney General, Patricia Benavides, said in a statement. “The Political Constitution of Peru enshrines the separation of powers and establishes that Peru is a democratic and sovereign republic … No authority can place itself above the Constitution and must comply with its constitutional mandates.”\n\nCNN has reached out to Castillo’s defense team for comment regarding the allegations.\n\nIt is a humiliating end to Castillo’s brief time in office. The former schoolteacher and union leader rose from obscurity to be elected in July 2021 by a narrow margin in a runoff, and was seen as part of a “pink tide” of new left-wing leaders in Latin America.\n\nHe ran on a platform promising to rewrite the constitution and increase wealth redistribution by granting states greater control over markets and natural resources, pledges that he has struggled to deliver amid rising inflation in Peru, his lack of political experience and strong conservative opposition in Congress.\n\nThe government of the leftist leader had been mired in chaos since inauguration, with dozens of ministers appointed, replaced, fired or quitting their posts in little over a year – piling further pressure on him.\n\nCastillo has railed against the opposition for trying to remove him from the first day he was in office. He has accused Benavides of orchestrating what he called a new form of “coup d’état” against him through her office’s investigations.\n\nIn October, Benavides filed a constitutional complaint against Castillo based on three of the six investigations her office had opened. The complaint allows Congress to carry out its own investigation against the former President.\n\nA cascade of investigations\n\nCastillo has faced a cascade of investigations on whether he used his position to benefit himself, his family and closest allies by peddling influence to gain favor or preferential treatment, among other claims.\n\nCastillo has repeatedly denied all allegations and reiterated his willingness to cooperate with any investigation. He argues the allegations are a result of a witch-hunt against him and his family from groups that failed to accept his election victory.\n\nLawmakers stand inside Congress on the day of their planned impeachment vote on President Pedro Castillo in Lima, Peru, Wednesday, Dec. 7, 2022. Guadalupe Pardo/AP\n\nThe former President faces five preliminary criminal investigations on allegations of masterminding corruption schemes while in office. These include prosecutors’ allegation that he led a “criminal network” that interfered with public institutions such as the Ministry of Transport and Communications, Ministry of Housing and Peru’s state-run oil company to control public bidding processes and benefit specific companies and close allies.\n\nProsecutors are also investigating whether the former President led efforts to peddle influence in the process of promoting officers in both the armed forces and national police.\n\nThese investigations also look into Castillo’s family, including his wife and sister-in-law. Former first lady Lilia Paredes is being investigated on suspicion of allegedly coordinating the criminal network. Her attorney, Benji Espinoza, has stressed her innocence and argues the investigation against the former first lady includes “a number of flaws and omissions.”\n\nPolice officers stand guard as people gather outside Peru's Congress after President Pedro Castillo said he will dissolve it on December 7. Sebastian Castaneda/Reuters\n\nHer sister-in-law Yenifer Paredes is under investigation for allegedly being a part of a criminal organization, money laundering and aggravated collusion. She was in custody until a judge revoked her “preventive detention” for 30 months. She too has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n“My daughter, my wife, my entire family have been attacked with the only purpose of destroying me because they don’t want me to finish my term, I promise you I will finish my term, I’m not corrupted,” Castillo said during a televised speech from the Presidential Palace on October 20.\n\nIn the same speech, Castillo admitted some of his closest allies should face justice over allegations of corruption, saying, “If they betrayed my trust, let justice take care of them.”\n\nPresident Boluarte’s image has also been tarnished by her own constitutional investigation by Congress, which was dismissed on December 5.\n\nHer ascendency may not necessarily ease Peru’s toxic and embittered political landscape as she would need to gain cross party support to be able to govern.\n\nMeanwhile, many Peruvians have been calling for a total reset.

It is my job.\"\n\nIn many ways, McCarthy's ouster was foreshadowed in January when a razor-thin GOP majority took five days and 15 rounds of votes to elect the California Republican speaker.\n\nMcCarthy was able to claw to the speaker's seat by herding right-wing opponents back into his camp after making several behind-the-scenes concessions, including the rule that allowed a single member to call for a vote ousting the speaker.\n\nThat ultimately was McCarthy's undoing when he angered a handful of conservatives for negotiating a debt ceiling deal with President Joe Biden and ushering through a 45-day budget extension with the help of Democrats to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nAfter telling foes to \"bring it on,\" McCarthy was unable to quell the GOP rebels led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, who said grassroots conservatives were fed up with the speaker's dealmaking and failed promises.\n\n\"My fear is the institution fell today,\" McCarthy told reporters.\n\nHere's a look at what happened Tuesday.\n\nHouse Dems left McCarthy hanging\n\nMcCarthy wasn't the only congressional leader tested on Tuesday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., came out swinging when he explained why his caucus shouldn't come to McCarthy's rescue. In a lengthy letter to members, he cited the GOP's \"unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism\" as a chief reason.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War,\" Jeffries wrote.\n\nThat's a departure from how the New York lawmaker, who many expect to be speaker should Democrats take back the House in 2024, has wielded the minority in previous fights. In other major impasses this year, such as the debt ceiling vote, Jeffries and other House Democratic leaders said members should vote their conscience.\n\nBut in this case, Jeffries spent a good portion of his political capital on helping topple McCarthy, who failed to reach an agreement with House Democratic leaders on a way to save himself by establishing a bipartisan, coalition government.\n\nGaetz v. GOP\n\nGaetz, the face of the rebellion, jousted with a series of McCarthy allies in the debate ahead of Tuesday's vote.\n\nThe Florida congressman outlined why the speaker has failed based on the agreement made in January, specifically saying McCarthy could not be trusted to fulfill the reforms grassroots conservatives demand.\n\n\"I don’t think voting against Speaker McCarthy is chaos. I think $33 trillion in debt is chaos,\" Gaetz said.\n\n\"I think not passing single-subject spending bills is chaos. I think the fact that we have been governed in this country, since the mid-90s, by continuing resolutions and omnibus bills is chaos.\"\n\nDuring the debate, McCarthy's supporters heralded his nearly nine-month reign as speaker, calling it one of the most conservative in history. But at a certain point, personal feelings boiled over on the House floor as some GOP lawmakers openly accused Gaetz of being a \"RINO\" (Republican in name only) working with Democrats, a camera-craving attention-seeker and an opportunist for fundraising off the speaker vote.\n\n\"It’s disgusting,\" said Rep. Garret Graves, R-La.\n\nGaetz responded by saying he would take \"no lecture\" from Republican colleagues who take money from lobbyists and have \"hollowed out this town.\"\n\nGang of Eight: Who were the Republicans who voted against McCarthy?\n\nEight Republicans lawmakers joined 208 Democrats and voted to eject McCarthy from the speakership, they were:\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, Arizona\n\nRep. Ken Buck, Colorado\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, Tennessee\n\nRep. Eli Crane, Arizona\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, Florida\n\nRep. Bob Good, Virginia\n\nRep. Nancy Mace, South Carolina\n\nRep. Matt Rosendale, Montana\n\nTrump left McCarthy hanging, too\n\nOne person strangely quiet about all of this was Donald Trump, who arguably could have helped McCarthy with the right-wing rebellion.\n\nTrump is busy attending his bank fraud trial in New York − one of the many court cases against him this year − but the 2024 GOP presidential front-runner has found time to pressure Republican members on other issues, such as demanding they pursue the Biden impeachment inquiry to supporting a government shutdown.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, he bemoaned the GOP drama: \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren’t they fighting the Radical left Democrats who are destroying our country?\"\n\nTrump made no public appeal to save McCarthy, however, which underscores how much of their relationship has been a one-way street. It is something some conservative commentators notice.\n\nNow what? 'Change the rules,' McCarthy says\n\nHonestly, we've never been here before.\n\nThe last time the House voted on a motion to vacate was in 1910 against Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-Ill., who ultimately survived.\n\nIn 2015, a similar move was made against Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, but he resigned before that idea ever made it to a floor vote.\n\nNow Republicans and Democrats must replay their saga from earlier in the year to choose a new speaker. In the meantime the House is paralyzed, much like it was in January.\n\nWhat's also up in the air is who else in the GOP conference wants the job.\n\nMost point to House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., as a likely successor.

But at the same time, he sought to reassure Egyptians that his latest moves would not plunge the country back into authoritarianism.\n\n\"There is no going back on freedom, democracy and the supremacy of the law,\" he said.\n\nThe worst violence this weekend was in the Mediterranean coastal city of Port Said, where seven people were killed on Sunday, pushing the toll for two days of clashes to at least 44. The unrest was sparked on Saturday by a court conviction and death sentence for 21 defendants involved in a mass soccer riot in the city's main stadium on Feb. 1, 2012 that left 74 dead.\n\nMost of those sentenced to death were local soccer fans from Port Said, deepening a sense of persecution that Port Said's residents have felt since the stadium disaster, the worst soccer violence ever in Egypt.\n\nAt least another 11 died on Friday elsewhere in the country during rallies marking the second anniversary of the anti-Mubarak uprising. Protesters used the occasion to renounce Morsi and his Islamic fundamentalist group, the Muslim Brotherhood, which emerged as the country's most dominant political force after Mubarak's ouster.\n\nThe curfew and state of emergency, both in force for 30 days, affect the provinces of Port Said, Ismailiya and Suez. The curfew takes effect Monday from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day.\n\nMorsi, in office since June, also invited the nation's political forces to a dialogue starting Monday to resolve the country's latest crisis. A statement issued later by his office said that among those invited were the country's top reform leader, Nobel peace Laureate Mohammed ElBaradei, former Arab League chief Amr Moussa and Hamdeen Sabahi, a leftist politician who finished third in last year's presidential race.\n\nThe three are leaders of the National Salvation Front, an umbrella for the main opposition parties.\n\nKhaled Dawoud, the Front's spokesman, said Morsi's invitation was meaningless unless he clearly states what is on the agenda. That, he added, must include amending a disputed constitution hurriedly drafted by the president's Islamist allies and rejected by the opposition.\n\nHe also faulted the president for not acknowledging his political responsibility for the latest bout of political violence.\n\n\"It is all too little too late,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\nIn many ways, Morsi's decree and his call for a dialogue betrayed his despair in the face of wave after wave of political unrest, violence and man-made disasters that, at times, made the country look like it was about to come unglued.\n\nA relative unknown until his Muslim Brotherhood nominated him to run for president last year, Morsi is widely criticized for having offered no vision for the country's future after nearly 30 years of dictatorship under Mubarak and no coherent policy to tackle seemingly endless problems, from a free falling economy and deeply entrenched social injustices to surging crime and chaos on the streets.\n\nReform of the judiciary and the police, hated under the old regime for brutality, are also key demands of Morsi's critics.\n\nMorsi did not say what he plans to do to stem the violence in other parts of the country outside those three provinces, but he did say he had instructed the police to deal \"firmly and forcefully\" with individuals attacking state institutions, using firearms to \"terrorize\" citizens or blocking roads and railway lines.\n\nThere were also clashes Sunday in Cairo and several cities in the Nile Delta region, including the industrial city of Mahallah.\n\nEgypt's current crisis is the second to hit the country since November, when Morsi issued decrees, since rescinded, that gave him nearly unlimited powers and placed him above any oversight, including by the judiciary.\n\nThe latest eruption of political violence has deepened the malaise as Morsi struggles to get a grip on enormous social and economic problems and the increasingly dangerous fault lines that divide this nation of 85 million.\n\nIn an ominous sign, a one-time jihadist group on Sunday blamed the secular opposition for the violence and threatened to set up vigilante militias to defend the government it supports.\n\nAddressing a news conference, Tareq el-Zomr of the once-jihadist Gamaa Islamiya, said:\n\n\"If security forces don't achieve security, it will be the right of the Egyptian people and we at the forefront to set up popular committees to protect private and public property and counter the aggression on innocent citizens.\"\n\nHis threat was accompanied by his charge that the opposition was responsible for the deadly violence of the past few days, setting the stage for possible bloody clashes between protesters and Islamist militiamen. The opposition denies the charge.\n\nIn Port Said on Sunday, tens of thousands of mourners poured into the streets for a mass funeral for most of the 37 people who died on Saturday. They chanted slogans against Morsi.\n\n\"We are now dead against Morsi,\" said Port Said activist Amira Alfy. \"We will not rest now until he goes and we will not take part in the next parliamentary elections. Port Said has risen and will not allow even a semblance of normalcy to come back,\" she said.\n\nThe violence flared only a month after a prolonged crisis — punctuated by deadly violence — over the new constitution. Ten died in that round of unrest and hundreds were injured.\n\nIn Port Said, mourners chanted \"There is no God but Allah,\" and \"Morsi is God's enemy\" as the funeral procession made its way through the city after prayers for the dead at the city's Mariam Mosque. Women clad in black led the chants, which were quickly picked up by the rest of the mourners.\n\nThere were no police or army troops in sight. But the funeral procession briefly halted after gunfire rang out. Security officials said the gunfire came from several mourners who opened fire at the Police Club next to the cemetery. Activists, however, said the gunfire first came from inside the army club, which is also close to the cemetery. Some of the mourners returned fire, which drew more shots as well as tear gas, according to witnesses. They, together with the officials, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation in the city on the Mediterranean at the northern tip of the Suez Canal.\n\nA total of 630 people were injured, some of them with gunshot wounds, said Abdel-Rahman Farag, director of the city's hospitals.\n\nAlso Sunday, army troops backed by armored vehicles staked out positions at key government facilities to protect state interests and try to restore order.\n\nThere was also a funeral in Cairo for two policemen killed in the Port Said violence a day earlier. Several policemen grieving for their colleagues heckled Interior Minister Mohammed Ibrahim, who is in charge of the force, when he arrived for their funeral, according to witnesses.\n\nThe angry officers screamed at the minister that he was only at the funeral for the TV cameras — a highly unusual show of dissent in Egypt, where the police force maintains military-like discipline.\n\nIbrahim hurriedly left and the funeral proceeded without him, a sign that the prestige of the state and its top executives were diminishing.\n\nIn Cairo, clashes broke out for the fourth straight day on Sunday, with protesters and police outside two landmark, Nile-side hotels near central Tahrir Square, birthplace of the 2011 uprising.

Pradeep Dambarage/NURPHO/Associated Press\n\nWhat is life like now in Sri Lanka?\n\nThe country has suffered its worst financial crisis in seven decades, after its foreign exchange reserves plummeted to record lows, with dollars running out to pay for essential imports including food, medicine and fuel.\n\nFor Sri Lankans, the crisis has turned their daily lives into an endless cycle of waiting in lines for basic goods, many of which are being rationed.\n\nDespite earlier efforts by the government to ease the crisis, like the introduction of a four-day work week, Wickremesinghe declared the country “bankrupt” last Tuesday.\n\nIn several major cities including the commercial capital, Colombo, desperate residents continue to queue for food and medicine, with reports of civilians clashing with police and the military as they wait in line.\n\nIn early July, Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera said the country had less than a day’s worth of fuel left.\n\nTrains have reduced in frequency, forcing travelers to squeeze into compartments and even sit precariously on top of them as they commute to work.\n\nPatients are unable to travel to hospitals due to the fuel shortage and food prices are soaring. Rice, a staple in the South Asian nation, has disappeared from shelves in many shops and supermarkets.\n\nPublic frustration and anger erupted on March 31, when demonstrators hurled bricks and started fires outside the President’s private residence.\n\nPolice used tear gas and water cannons to break up the protests, and imposed a 36-hour curfew afterward.\n\nPresident Rajapaksa declared a nationwide public emergency on April 1, giving authorities powers to detain people without a warrant, and blocked social media platforms.\n\nBut protests went ahead the next day in defiance of the curfew, prompting police to arrest hundreds of demonstrators.\n\nWhat’s the background to these protests?\n\nThe crisis has been years in the making, said experts, who point to a series of government decisions that compounded external shocks.\n\nOver the past decade, the Sri Lankan government has borrowed vast sums of money from foreign lenders to fund public services, said Murtaza Jafferjee, chair of Colombo-based think tank Advocata Institute.\n\nThis borrowing spree has coincided with a series of hammer blows to the Sri Lankan economy, from both natural disasters – such as heavy monsoons – to man-made catastrophes, including a government ban on chemical fertilizers that decimated farmers’ harvests.\n\nFacing a massive deficit, Rajapaksa slashed taxes in a doomed attempt to stimulate the economy.\n\nBut the move backfired, instead hitting government revenue. That prompted rating agencies to downgrade Sri Lanka to near default levels, meaning the country lost access to overseas markets.\n\nSri Lanka then had to fall back on its foreign exchange reserves to pay off government debt, shrinking its reserves. This impacted imports of fuel and other essentials, which sent prices soaring.\n\nTopping all that, the government in March floated the Sri Lankan rupee – meaning its price was determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange markets.\n\nHowever, the plunging of the rupee against the US dollar only made things worse for ordinary Sri Lankans.", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/17/beaver-county-man-tried-to-save-father-fatally-shot-at-trump-rally-butler/74421522007/", "title": "'He was a true hero:' PA man shares his attempt to help father killed ...", "text": "BUTLER — Once he realized what was going on, Beaver County Republican Rico Elmore was one of those who jumped into action Saturday night at the Butler Farm show field to help others in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former president Donald Trump.\n\nInvited to the local event as a speaker, Elmore, vice chairman of the Beaver County Republican Committee, was one of many from western Pennsylvania who had a chance to speak before Trump took the stage on July 13. He was the last speaker on the stage before Trump was introduced.\n\nAs the former president was speaking to the crowd, addressing slides on a screen nearby, Elmore was watching the presentation from a \"VIP section\" that included other candidates and lawmakers.\n\n\"Trump is speaking, and then you hear those shots ring out,\" he said. \"We thought that the first shot was fireworks or something similar. It's like, 'Why is someone bringing the fireworks into this kind of venue? That's crazy.' And then we heard the other shots and I know it's shots being fired.\"\n\nServing as a technical sergeant for the Air National Guard, the sound was an immediate call to action for Elmore and others in his section to go into \"military mode.\" The group of lawmakers and politicians immediately jumped into action, rushing to help people around the crowd and encourage them to get to safety.\n\nAs he was rushing to help the audience, Elmore also heard cries indicating somebody was hit by the gunfire.\n\n\"I made contact with someone who was yelling for a medic and they're saying that 'he's been hit.' I grabbed a water bottle, I yanked my tie off and I ran towards the guy who was hit,\" Elmore said. \"I hopped over the barricade and I tried to perform life-saving techniques.\"\n\nAt this time, many of the cameras at the day's event were focused on the chaos around former President Trump, who could be seen bleeding from his ear as he was rushed off stage by Secret Service agents. As the federal agents assisted Trump off the stage, it became increasingly clear an assassination attempt had taken place, with federal agencies and local police working to secure the area.\n\nJumping the barrier, Elmore joined a doctor in their attempts to save the life of 50-year-old Corey Comperatore, of Sarver, Butler County. Reporters from USA Today have shared that Comperatore, who served as the former chief of the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Company, was believed to be shielding his family at the time he was shot.\n\n\"Corey, he was like stuck, sort of hunched over where he was shot,\" Elmore said. \"We pulled him up, turned him over and started to perform CPR. I was holding his head where he was shot, trying to hold the blood and everything in so that we could save his life. We came to find out later that we were unsuccessful with that. He's the one who did pass away from the gunshot wound.\"\n\nAs additional medical personnel arrived, Elmore joined the efforts to help clear the area and ensure people got to safety. Elmore joined the groups of people helping the Comperatore family and others in need get to safety, reuniting them with family out of the danger zone.\n\n\"It was a traumatic and painful experience,\" Elmore said. \"They could not walk, literally they were just falling. Me and the doctor put the mother's arms around us and we carried her out. We took kids out on our shoulders. We carried them out, we got people into safety and I just kept running back into the danger area to get people. There were soldiers and other people helping, it was just insane.\"\n\nLater that day, federal agencies and the Pennsylvania State Police confirmed the shooter was 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park. The motives for the assassination attempt remained under investigation as of Tuesday morning, but federal investigators determined Crooks fired several rounds from what has been described as an \"AR-15 style rifle.\"\n\nIn addition to injuring the former president's ear, Crooks is responsible for the death of Comperatore and severe gunshot wounds to 57-year-old David Dutch, of New Kensington, and 74-year-old James Copenhaver, of Moon Township. This mass shooting occurs as political tensions are high across the country, with the divisive atmosphere being a focal point of discussions following the incident.\n\n\"As a community, as a state, and as a nation, you never know when your time is up,\" Elmore said. \"We cannot sit here and be separated because of political means, because of anger and animosity. We have to stand together as a unit, we're the United States of America. Every other country in this world that I've been to, they want to be like us and enjoy the freedoms that we have. Let's not allow that to vanish because of political divisiveness.\"\n\nWhile the national lens is likely to stay focused on the law enforcement responses and the motives of the attempted assassination in the coming weeks, Pennsylvania communities have already shown an outpouring of support for the Comperatore family online and raised over $4 million via GoFundMe for the three victims' families.\n\n\"The honor that their father showed is unremarkable, a true American hero who put his life on the line for his family,\" Elmore said. \"He was a volunteer firefighter, who spent his time saving people, and those instincts kicked in at a time of terror and disorganization. Find comfort in that he was a true hero.\"\n\nAs local communities continue to try and make sense of the tragedy at the farm show, Elmore doesn't want to be labeled as a hero for jumping in to help people who were in need at the event. Like many of the people from Southwestern Pennsylvania, he says he was simply being a good neighbor and helper.\n\n\"I am not a hero,\" Elmore said. \"I did what was right, what I was trained to do. Corey and the doctor? Those are the true heroes of that day.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/17"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/politics/960171/how-the-iraq-war-started", "title": "How the Iraq war started | The Week", "text": "“Our mission is clear,” declared president George W. Bush following the ground invasion of Iraq on 20 March 2003: “to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction [WMDs], to end Saddam Hussein’s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people”.\n\nThe Bush administration alleged a material breach of UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which in late 2002 had given Iraq “a final opportunity” to disarm (an obligation imposed after its defeat in the first Gulf War in 1991).\n\nThe official case for war fell apart quickly: no significant WMDs were ever found, and by late 2003, Bush conceded there was no evidence linking Saddam to al-Qa’eda. That has led many to suggest a range of other motives, from spreading democracy to controlling the oil trade, to projecting US power.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

(Saddam had destroyed his WMD in the 1990s, but was unwilling to reveal this; as the UN weapons inspector Hans Blix put it, he had kept the “beware of the dog” sign, though he’d got rid of the dog.)\n\nBut yes, in the sense that the intelligence was deeply flawed – in many cases second-or third-hand, or fabricated by regime opponents living in exile – and was presented without the necessary qualifications.\n\nIn September 2002, PM Tony Blair published a dossier that, he said, “established beyond doubt” that Iraq had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, and could deploy them within 45 minutes. In 2016, the Iraq Inquiry chaired by John Chilcot found that Blair’s certainty on this point was not justified, and that British intelligence ought to have corrected him.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHow was the decision to invade made?\n\nA timetable was set early on: the US wanted to invade in spring 2003, before the summer heat. Everything else – intelligence, legal arguments, diplomacy – ultimately cleaved to that.\n\nThe “Downing Street Memo” of July 2002 quoted Sir Richard Dearlove, head of MI6, just back from Washington, saying that war had become “inevitable”: “Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.”\n\nThe Chilcot inquiry found the decision was made before the peaceful options for disarmament had been exhausted; and Blair had decided to support war early on. “I will be with you, whatever,” he told Bush in July 2002.\n\nIs this a case of 20/20 hindsight?\n\nTo an extent: few admit to backing the war today, although at the time 49 nations supported it, along with (according to YouGov) 54% of the UK public, and most of the British press. There were, though, plenty of dissenters.\n\nMore than 750,000 people joined the Stop the War rally in London on 15 February 2003. On 18 March 2003, 139 Labour MPs, along with every Liberal Democrat and a few rebel Tories, voted for an amendment that said that “the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established”. For the same reason, France and Germany opposed the invasion; the Arab League issued a statement warning that it would “open the gates of hell”.\n\nWhy did things go wrong?\n\nThe US did not have a clear postwar plan. A meticulously planned military operation – leading to total conquest by 1 May, incurring about 150 casualties – was followed by a totally incompetent occupation. Iraqi euphoria at Saddam’s removal gave way to looting (“Stuff happens,” said US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld. “Freedom’s untidy.”).\n\nUK postwar planning was also “wholly inadequate”, found Chilcot, who identified key failings, such as the policy of total “de‐Ba’athification” (the removal of all officials from Saddam’s ruling party) and the dissolution of Iraq’s security services.\n\n“But the big mistake, the original sin,” says Prof Toby Dodge of the LSE, “was to invade a country you know nothing about with a bunch of exiles that had not been there for 20 years. It was destined for failure. Full stop.”\n\nWhy did Iraq descend into chaos?\n\nThe insurgency against US and coalition troops began in 2003, led by Ba’athists and Sunnis whose long ascendancy over Iraq’s Shia majority had been ended. It was galvanised by civilian deaths and reports of US abuses – notably the torture of suspects in Abu Ghraib prison, revealed in early 2004.\n\nSimultaneously, Shia militia groups fought against both Sunnis and the occupation. In 2006, full-scale sectarian war erupted with the bombing of a Shia shrine in the city of Samarra by Sunni extremists. Brutal reprisals by Shia militants and “death squads” against Sunni civilians followed, feeding a cycle of violence.\n\nThe situation was stabilised in 2007 by the US troop “surge”, supported by Sunni moderates. But Iraq was plunged into civil war again by Islamic State, whose leaders met in a US prison camp, and which proclaimed a caliphate across much of Iraq and Syria in 2014.\n\nWhat were the long-term results?\n\nIraq, today, is relatively calm and is a democracy of sorts; but the rule of law is weak, militias still play a big role, and it is one of the most corrupt states on Earth.\n\nAgainst the limited gains must be set the carnage: casualties are hard to estimate, but Iraq Body Count recorded some 200,000 civilian deaths up to 2019. There were also 4,491 US and 179 UK military deaths.\n\nGeopolitically, the war was a disaster: it poisoned America’s image in the Middle East, distracted it from the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban, undermined the case for democracy, and strengthened Iran and its proxies. It also undermined one of the most basic elements of international law: that states should not invade other states.

According to the Brookings Institution, it is the primary law defining the cases in which a president may deploy federal troops in the face of civil unrest. It lays out the following three scenarios for authorizations of force:\n\nThe state requests federal assistance\n\nA rebellion makes it impossible to enforce federal law\n\nSome sort of violence or conspiracy is depriving others of their Constitutional rights\n\nThe law is meant to be an exception to the core U.S. legal principle that the military should not be involved in civilian affairs.\n\nTrump floated using the military against 2020 summer protests\n\nThe Insurrection Act has been invoked many times throughout history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Presidents George Washington and John Adams used it to quash early rebellions against federal authority. President Abraham Lincoln used it at the start of the Civil War, and some presidents used it during the civil rights movement to enforce federal desegregation orders.\n\nThe last time the Insurrection Act was used was under President George H.W. Bush during the Los Angeles race riots, but it was done so at the request of the California governor, Brennan Center data shows.\n\nTrump wanted to use the Insurrection Act to tamp down protests and riots during the summer of 2020, but was met with pushback from his own administration.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Orion spacecraft, which is at the core of NASA’s historic Artemis I mission, reached its farthest distance from Earth Monday afternoon, shattering the record for the maximum distance a spacecraft designed to carry humans has ever traveled.\n\nThe space agency confirmed Monday evening that the Orion capsule had reached the midpoint of its uncrewed mission around the moon — about 270,000 miles (434,523 kilometers) from Earth. That’s more than 40,000 miles (64,374 kilometers) beyond the far side of the moon.\n\nThe previous record for the farthest a human-rated spacecraft has traveled was set during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970. That mission, which did actually have humans on board, stretched out to 248,655 miles (400,171 kilometers) from our home planet.\n\nThe goal of the Artemis I mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on November 16, is to test the Orion capsule to its limits, ensuring the vehicle is ready to safely host humans. The trial run is part of NASA’s broader Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since the 1970s.\n\nThere have been several hiccups — or “funnies,” as Artemis I Mission Manager Michael Sarafin refers to them — on this mission.\n\nOne problem was related to Orion’s star tracker, a system that uses a map of the cosmos to tell engineers on the ground how the spacecraft is oriented. Some data readings weren’t coming back as expected, but NASA officials chalked that up to a learning curve that comes with operating a new spacecraft.\n\n“We worked through that, and there was some great leadership by the Orion team,” Sarafin said at a November 18 press conference.\n\nHitting the marks — and then some\n\nOverall, however, the spacecraft’s performance has been “outstanding,” Orion Program Manager Howard Hu told reporters Monday evening. The spacecraft is outperforming expectations in some respects, such as producing about 20% more power than it really needs, he noted.\n\nSarafin added that things are going so well that NASA is working to add seven additional mission objectives designed to gather more data about the spacecraft’s capabilities and performance.\n\nThe spacecraft is now expected to swoop back toward the moon before firing its engines on Thursday to exit its current trajectory and head back toward Earth. The Orion capsule is on track to splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California on December 11.\n\nIn this image provided by NASA, the Earth and its moon are seen from NASA's Orion spacecraft on Monday. NASA/AP\n\n“Artemis I has had extraordinary success and has completed a series of history-making events,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said Monday. “Since the launch, we have been receiving critical data back and there’s a lot more to come. … The biggest test after the launch is the reentry because we want to know that that heat shield works at about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,760 degrees Celsius), almost half as hot as the sun, coming in at 32 times the speed of sound (nearly 40,000 kilometers per hour).”\n\nRead more: A visual tour of the most powerful rocket ever built\n\nUntil the spacecraft is safely back on Earth, there is always risk in play, Sarafin added. He noted that the risk of hitting orbital debris is a constantly looming threat that won’t disappear until the capsule reenters the Earth’s atmosphere. And even after that, Orion must safely deploy parachutes to ensure a gentle ocean splashdown.\n\nAfter landing, a NASA recovery ship will be waiting nearby to haul the Orion capsule to safety.\n\nIf the Artemis I mission is successful, NASA will then look to choose a crew to fly on the Artemis II mission, which could take off as soon as 2024. Artemis II will aim to send astronauts on a similar trajectory as Artemis I, flying around the moon but not landing on its surface. The Artemis III mission, currently slated for a 2025 launch, is expected to finally put boots back on the moon, and NASA officials have said it will include the first woman and the first person of color to achieve such a milestone.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/06/12/new-name-same-mission-cape-cod-space-force-station-bourne/7602693002/", "title": "New name, same mission, for Cape Cod Space Force Station in ...", "text": "BOURNE — Cape Cod Air Force Station has a new name but its deadly earnest mission remains the same: protecting the US and its allies from attacks launched from space or on Earth by its superpower rivals.\n\nAt a renaming ceremony Friday morning, the installation officially changed its name to Cape Cod Space Force Station, which will continue to serve as the home of the 6th Space Warning Squadron.\n\n“The return of great power competition is real,” said Lt. Gen. Nina M. Armagno, director of staff, headquarters, United States Space Force. “The global security environment has changed and space is right in the middle of it. Space is no longer a benign environment. Both Russia and China are actively building systems that will counter us in space.”\n\nThe United States is already aware that Russia and China are building their cyber and nuclear capabilities but, “in space, it is getting pretty intense,” Armagno said.\n\nRenaming the station is an important step in establishing the culture and identity of the United States Space Force, Armagno said.\n\n“It is also a powerful signal to our nation, allies, and adversaries that we are prepared to deter, fight, and win the United States space war,” Armagno said. “We will always be one team, a no-fail team.”\n\nThe 6th Space Warning Squadron's mission is to survey air and space to detect, track and report missile launches and high-satellite interest passes.\n\nThe Chinese and the Russians are encroaching technologically on the United States, said U.S. Rep. William Keating, D-Mass., one of the speakers at the ceremony.\n\n“That threat is really real,” Keating said. “The effects of that can be devastating, not just in our military actions but also protecting our grids and basic infrastructure at home that can affect the private side and our daily lives.”\n\nTo protect the U.S., the nation has satellites in three-tier orbits around the globe. The closest houses the intelligence surveillance reconnaissance systems, which the military uses to keep an eye on a region to locate an enemy or ascertain strategic features. The middle one houses the GPS systems.\n\nIn geosynchronous orbit, farthest from the Earth’s surface, are housed some of the nation’s highest value assets of strategic missile warning satellites and strategic communication satellites.\n\n“By the year 2025, which is right around the corner, (the Russians and Chinese) will be able to threaten us in every orbital regime,” Armagno said.\n\nThe station on Cape began life on Oct. 1, 1979, as an outpost in the Cold War, home to the only land-based East Coast radar in the United States.\n\nThe site was the first PAVE PAWS installation in the country. “PAVE” is a program name for electronics systems and “PAWS” stands for phased array warning system. PAVE PAWS radar monitors and tracks over 30,000 earth-orbiting objects to enable space domain awareness and continuously provides crucial missile warning and space surveillance data to the U.S. Space Command and coalition partners.\n\nThe station was first made to protect the United States from the threats of nuclear warheads crossing continents and then again when submarine warfare advanced and ballistic missiles created logistical problems, Keating said.\n\n“Now, we face an even greater threat, in my view,” Keating said.\n\nUsing the human body as an analogy, Keating said that this new mission is the neurological part of that.\n\n“It is the connector, the impulse, and everything else in our defense system,” he said.\n\nNot only does this satellite system help with the threat of terrorism and terrorist activity, but it can also detect nuclear stockpiles around the world and provides troops on the ground vital information on moving logistically and communications, Keating said. In the era of climate change it affects not only the military, but the important meteorological assets the country has in space as well, he said.\n\n“It is the area frankly (where) our enemies and our adversaries have closed the ground to the greatest extent,” Keating said.\n\nIt is not just the technology that the United States has an advantage in, Keating said, it is the personnel.\n\n“The mission couldn’t be more important, and I’m so proud to have it here right on Cape Cod, with its history of beating back decades of challenges,” Keating said.\n\nContact Beth Treffeisen at btreffeisen@capecodonline.com.

I looked around the sky above me was completely black,” Baumgartner told CNN Sport’s Patrick Snell as he reflected on his Red Bull Stratos freefall in October 2012, as he looked at Earth from a vantage point of 127,852 feet (some 24 miles/39 kilometers).\n\n“I was really trying to inhale that moment,” added Baumgartner.\n\nAnd with more that eight million people watching on YouTube, the Austrian daredevil uttered those famous words: “Sometimes you have to go up to understand how small you are. I’m coming home now.”\n\nBaumgartner's suit took him months to get used to wearing. Getty Images\n\nSix years in the making\n\nIt was a project that was initially expected to take 24 months from start to finish but ended up a taking up a number more years.\n\n“We thought, we’re going to build the capsule, build the pressure suit, practice for a while, and then we go all the way up to the stratosphere and come back to Earth at supersonic speed,” says Baumgartner.\n\n“Sometimes we’d go into a meeting with three problems and then leave that meeting eight hours later with another five … and no solution for the previous problems.”\n\nTo get Baumgartner up to the stratosphere, his team had to construct a helium balloon the size of 33 football pitches – weighing 3,708lbs. It took as many as 20 people to move without damaging the balloon’s material that was 10 times thinner than a sandwich bag.\n\nBut the biggest threat to the project was perhaps the most unforeseen – Baumgartner’s mental fortitude.\n\nThe suit had to be both pressurized and able to handle temperatures of minus 72° Celsius (minus 97.6° Farenheit).\n\n“It’s very uncomfortable,” says Baumgartner. “You have a total lack of mobility. It always feels like you’re breathing through a pillow. You’re completely separated from the outside world. So once the visor is down, all you can hear is yourself breathing.”\n\nThe prospect of lasting up to eight hours in the pressure suit would take Baumgartner a number of months – and help from psychiatrists and sports psychologists – to accept.\n\n“I had to look at the suit like it is my friend, not my enemy,” adds Baumgartner.\n\n\"The only thing that I didn't know when I landed was: did I break the speed of sound,\" says Baumgartner. Red Bull/Shutterstock\n\nSupersonic Man\n\nThe Austrian jumped from the balloon effectively while in space, where the normal rules of sky diving do not apply.\n\nHe spent the next nine minutes falling through the sky, half of which were in complete freefall.\n\n“Once I was on my way, I slowly started to spin in one direction, then I start spinning in the opposite direction, and then I really started spinning faster and faster and faster,” Baumgartner explained.\n\nBaumgartner hadn’t been able to train for freefall in space, so that spinning sensation was extremely disconcerting.\n\n“This was a very alarming moment because there is no protocol,” the 53-year-old said as he plummeted at a speed of 843.6 mph (1357.64 kmh) – 1.25 times that of sound. “It’s like sailing without wind meaning your skills do not work.”\n\nHe eventually passed through the Armstrong line, where the air becomes thicker, and Baumgartner was able to stabilize himself and started to “enjoy my skydive.”\n\nBaumgartner's record for highest sky dive had since been broken.

Because, once you’re in freefall, you know you’re fast, but you have absolutely no indication of how fast you actually are.”\n\nBaumgartner endured an agonizing 10-minute wait – more time than when he was actually in the air – before he received confirmation that he hit a top speed of 844mph, over 75mph faster than the speed of sound.\n\n“And at that moment I was really happy and satisfied because to me, breaking the speed of sound as a human, the first human in history, that was definitely something.”", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/01/24/full-moon-calendar-2024-astronomy-supermoon/72087293007/", "title": "Full moons in 2024: Jan. 25 will start off the year with the first", "text": "The first full moon of 2024 will rise on Jan. 25 at 12:54 p.m. EST. Traditionally known as the Wolf Moon because of a greater chance of hearing wolves howling during that time, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac.\n\nEver since the first humans looked up at the sky and saw the gray, cratered surface of the moon, legends have been fueled by it. There are stories about a mysterious \"man in the moon\" since some witnesses claimed to have seen a person's face among the craters. Other observers compared the craters to cheese and imagined a whole sphere composed of mouthwatering dairy goods.\n\nToday, we know a lot more about Earth's natural satellite.\n\nPhases of the moon\n\nThe moon takes about 30 days to orbit the Earth, which is called a lunar cycle. Each lunar cycle is divided into eight phases based on the moon's position relative to the sun.\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nWhat are solstices and equinoxes?\n\nAstronomers have been observing the solstices and equinoxes for thousands of years, which are a way to signal the beginning of seasons because of Earth's orbit around the sun.\n\nThe spring, or vernal, equinox happens around March 19-20 and, like the autumnal equinox, is when the day and night are of equal length. The days will get longer because more light is shed on Earth up until the summer solstice.\n\nThe summer solstice happens around June 20-21 and sees the most daytime of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. After that, the days will become shorter until the winter solstice on Dec. 21 or 22, when there’s the least daylight of the year.\n\nUpcoming dates for full moons in 2024, (times in EDT), according to NASA:\n\nWhat is the moon made of?\n\nThe lunar surface is composed of 43% oxygen, 20% silicon, 19% magnesium, 10% iron, 3% calcium, 3% aluminum, 0.42% chromium, 0.18% titanium, and 0.12% manganese by weight.\n\nThere are traces of water that may have come from deep beneath the surface and have been found by orbiting spacecraft, according to Space.com.\n\nThe moon has a thick, metallic core. Most of its core is made of iron, with a small amount of nickel. Compared with other terrestrial worlds (like Earth), whose cores are closer to 50% of their diameters, the moon's core is fairly modest, at roughly 20% of its diameter.\n\nHow big is the moon? Its radius is 1,079.6 miles. The moon's width is less than one-third of Earth's, according to NASA.\n\nWhat is a supermoon?\n\nWhen the moon’s orbit brings it closer to Earth than usual, the cosmic combo is called a supermoon. A supermoon occurs when the moon’s orbit is closest to Earth at the same time the moon is full.\n\nThis happens when the full moon falls at perigee – its closest point to Earth in its orbit. Perigee is when the moon is 221,519 miles from Earth and appears bigger and brighter than a normal full moon.\n\nWhen the moon reaches apogee, it’s at its farthest from Earth, a distance of 252,712 miles. If a full moon occurs while the moon is at apogee, it is called a micromoon.\n\nWe'll see four supermoons this year. Starting off with a special seasonal blue moon on Aug. 19, which will be the last blue moon until May 20, 2027. The other full supermoons will occur on Sept. 18, Oct. 17 and Nov. 15, according to EarthSky.org.\n\nWhat is a blood moon?\n\nA blood moon occurs during a total lunar eclipse, which is when the Earth lines up between the moon and the sun. The eclipse blocks direct sunlight to the moon, so the only light it gets passes through the Earth’s atmosphere, which filters out most of the sunlight’s colors, except for red. The atmosphere refracts, or bends, the reddish light toward the moon, which reflects it with a red glow.\n\nThe last blood moon occurred in November 2022, and the next one won't occur until March 2025, according to Space.com.\n\nNames of full moons\n\nThe etymology behind the word “lunatic,” a synonym for mentally ill, comes from the Latin root of luna, which means moon. People as far back as 400 B.C. noticed that the lunar cycle affected people's mental states.\n\nThe gravitational force of the moon causes many visible changes on Earth, affecting the ocean’s tides, animals’ migration habits and humans’ ability to sleep. Full moons have been heralded to have the most influence.\n\nThe Old Farmer’s Almanac, a reference book published since the 18th century, named the full moons for those used by Native American, colonial American and European sources, so their meanings derive from characteristics of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nIn Christianity, the full moon that appears before the spring equinox is known as the lenten moon, marking the last full moon of winter. The full moon that appears after the equinox is known as the paschal moon to mark the first full moon of spring. The paschal moon determines the date of Easter every year.\n\nContributing: Doyle Rice and Ashley R.

The system collects information, including:\n\n◾ Data from science instruments that monitor cosmic rays, solar wind particles, the sun's magnetic field, and other phenomena.\n\n◾ Engineering data on spacecraft operating systems.\n\nThe Flight Data Subsystem gives that information to the spacecraft’s Telemetry Modulation Unit. The The unit converts the data to binary code – consisting of zeros and ones, the simplest form of computer code – then transmits that code to Earth, using Voyager's 12-foot antenna dish.\n\nThe data is received by NASA's Deep Space Network, giant 112-foot radio antennas placed around the world. The network handles space communications from several missions.\n\nIn November, the Telemetry Modulation Unit transmissions became a repeating pattern of zeros and ones \"as if it were stuck,\" NASA said.\n\nEngineers restarted the Flight Data System in December, but that failed to fix the problem.\n\nVoyager 1 is far away – and it's getting old\n\nVoyager 1 has been in space for more than 46 years. Attempts to fix problems aboard the spacecraft often mean \"consulting original, decades-old documents written by engineers who didn’t anticipate the issues that are arising today,\" NASA says.\n\nEngineers have consulted archived documents to find solutions to other Voyager problems in the past, wired.com says.\n\nEngineers need time to understand how new commands will affect the spacecraft and to avoid unintended consequences. It's a complicated, time-consuming process.\n\nA long time lag makes solving the problem more difficult. Voyager is moving at about 38,000 mph. It takes 22.5 hours for an Earth radio signal to reach Voyager and another 22.5 hours for the spacecraft’s reply to reach antenna networks on Earth.\n\nThat means engineers must wait 45 hours to get a response and learn if a command has been successful.\n\nWhat was the key computer signal?\n\nThe key signal was received after engineers \"poked\" the spacecraft.\n\n◾ March 1: Teams send a command known as a “poke” to Voyager. In essence, the poke tells the Flight Data System to try different sequences in its software program, in the hope a corrupted portion can be found and bypassed.\n\n◾ March 3: Engineers receive a new signal from Voyager that is different from both the unreadable dial tone and the spacecraft’s original transmission stream.\n\n◾ March 7: Engineers begin decoding the signal.\n\n◾ March 10: A Deep Space Network engineer finishes decoding the new signal and finds it contains a readout of the spacecraft’s entire Flight Data System memory. That includes instructions for the spacecraft when it receives commands or when its operational status changes.\n\n◾ April 4: Engineers trace the problem to a chip in the FDS but are not sure what caused the problem. It could have been hit by an energetic particle from space or was simply worn out because of age, NASA says.\n\n◾ April 18: Controllers send a command to Voyager to reposition the code.\n\n◾ April 20: Voyager sends a transmission indicating the repositioning has worked.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nEngineers will reposition the other sections of the code to allow Voyager to resume transmitting science data.\n\nVoyager 2 was launched first on Aug. 20, 1977. Voyager 1 was launched Sept. 5, 1977. It was put on a faster, shorter trajectory, which took it to interstellar space ahead of Voyager 2.\n\nThe Voyagers are the only spacecraft in the interstellar void. NASA's New Horizons probe, launched Jan. 19, 2006, flew past Pluto in 2015 and is expected to enter interstellar space in the 2040s.\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology; Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/01/world/moonikin-campos-artemis-1-saturday-launch-scn/index.html", "title": "Meet Commander Moonikin Campos, the mannequin going farther ...", "text": "Turn to CNN for live coverage from Kennedy Space Center in Florida this week. Space correspondent Kristin Fisher will bring us moment-by-moment reporting from the launch, along with a team of experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nArtemis I will carry an unconventional crew when it’s expected to lift off Wednesday on a journey around the moon.\n\nRather than astronauts, a mannequin named Commander Moonikin Campos will helm the Orion spacecraft, with two mannequin torsos called Helga and Zohar along for the ride.\n\nThe Artemis program aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the moon and eventually deliver astronauts to Mars.\n\nThe inaugural mission will test out the new Space Launch System rocket, Orion spacecraft and multiple components designed to make deep space travel safer for humans.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos (left) and twin torsos Helga and Zohar will be the crew for Artemis I. NASA\n\nMannequins in a spacecraft with enviable views of the moon may sound like some sort of joke, but these three passengers will serve as canaries in the coal mine of space.\n\nOrion will travel 40,000 miles (64,373 kilometers) beyond the moon, breaking the record set by Apollo 13, to go farther than any spacecraft intended to carry humans.\n\nThis is far from low-Earth orbit, where the International Space Station circles the Earth. Orion’s future crews will be exposed to deep space radiation – especially once they venture for longer stays on the moon and set off for Mars.\n\nMoonikin’s mission\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos’ name, picked via a public contest, is a nod to Arturo Campos, a NASA electrical power subsystem manager who aided in the troubled Apollo 13’s safe return to Earth. The mannequin, sporting the Orion Crew Survival System suit, can collect data on what future human crews might experience.\n\nCommander Moonikin Campos will test out a flight suit intended for future astronauts. Ben Smegelsky/NASA\n\nThe suit has been designed for Artemis astronauts to wear during launch and reentry, and it is outfitted with two radiation sensors.\n\nIt can sustain a crew member for up to six days in the event of an in-space emergency, something that has never been attempted before, said Dustin Gohmert, Orion Crew Survival Systems project manager at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n\n“You can almost think of it as a personalized spacecraft – a secondary but much more personalized spacecraft that protects the crew member, provides them pressure, oxygen, cooling and any other life-sustaining functions that are needed,” Gohmert said.\n\nDummies were in place for drop tests in new seats to simulate the Orion spacecraft's environment. NASA\n\nWith new safety features, Commander Moonikin Campos’ seat resembles that of a race car’s, with a cocoon forming around its occupant, he said. The seat has shock absorbers in case of landing in rough seas or other scenarios.\n\nPhantom twins\n\nTwin mannequins Helga and Zohar have a separate mission. The two torsos are based on phantoms, used for radiation treatment planning in hospitals, said Thomas Berger, Helga and Zohar principal investigator at the German Aerospace Center.\n\nThe phantoms Helga and Zohar will experience deep space radiation inside Orion. StemRad\n\nBoth phantoms are made of materials that mimic the soft tissue, organs and bones of a woman. Their epoxy resin forms even resemble human lung and brain tissue to test how radiation passes through the human body.\n\nThe torsos have more than 5,600 sensors and 34 radiation detectors to measure how much radiation exposure occurs within different organs during the mission.\n\nThe mannequins are part of the Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment, or MARE, a collaboration between the German Aerospace Center, the Israel Space Agency, NASA and institutions across multiple countries.\n\nZohar will wear AstroRad, a radiation protection vest, to test how effective it could be if future crews encounter a solar storm, while Helga will be unprotected.\n\nThe AstroRad vest was tested on the International Space Station in January 2020. NASA\n\nSolar storms unleashed by the sun can last for days or weeks. The developers of AstroRad hope that the vest would allow future Artemis crews to continue performing daily activities despite space weather. The vest is made of thousands of shielding cores that can protect vital human organs against solar energy particles.\n\nCombating space radiation\n\nDifferent organs have different susceptibilities to space radiation, said Ramona Gaza, the MARE science team lead at Johnson Space Center.\n\nThe MARE project aims to measure the differences between how specific organs, such as the brain, respond to radiation.\n\nPreviously, different limits of radiation exposure have been set for astronauts on the space station.\n\nA June 2021 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine suggested a new standard limit for all astronauts regardless of age or gender: 600 millisieverts of radiation over the course of a career, Gaza said.\n\n“Millisieverts measure the health effect of low doses of ionizing radiation on the human body,” according to the report.\n\nResults from sensors on Artemis I, including those of a new suit, could provide data for future missions. NASA\n\nNot all scientists have accepted previous studies showing discrepancies in the different responses between men and women to radiation, Gaza said.\n\nData returned by the Artemis I mission could have an impact on the standard limit for male and female astronauts.\n\n“The United States of America is half men, half women. Well, space should be at least that,” said Reid Wiseman, chief of the Astronaut Office at Johnson Space Center. “So if we cannot make these spacecraft equitable, and we can’t fly any type of person on them, then we need to look at our systems and reevaluate.”\n\nMeanwhile, NASA’s astronauts are doing everything they can to prepare for the Artemis missions by training in virtual reality situations and in environments that simulate lunar conditions, he said.\n\nThe agency hopes to announce the Artemis II crew, slated to take astronauts on a similar journey around the moon, later this year, according to Wiseman. Artemis II is expected to launch in 2024.\n\n“To me, it’s just the most awe-inspiring moment that we’ve had here at NASA,” Wiseman said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/04/16/space-junk-nasa-debris-reentry-problem/73286573007/", "title": "What is space junk? Why its reentry to Earth poses a major problem.", "text": "Who knew space could get crowded? Junk is filling the space above Earth.\n\nIn recent weeks, some of that junk has made its way back.\n\nIn January 2021, astronauts at the International Space Station pitched a pallet of used lithium-ion batteries over the side to free up some room after NASA determined it would \"harmlessly reenter the Earth’s atmosphere,\" according to Ars Technica.\n\nThree years later, on March 8 of this year, a nearly 2-pound chunk of it may have torn through the roof and two floors of a man's house in Naples, Florida.\n\nOn April 2, large fiery streaks of light appeared over a wide area over Los Angeles. It turned out to be space debris, part of a Chinese spacecraft, according to the U.S. Space Command.\n\nWhat is space junk? We explain:\n\nThere are various types of space junk\n\nSpace junk basically is any machinery or debris left in space by humans.\n\nItems range in size from large objects such as failed or dead satellites to tiny objects such as paint flecks and nuts and bolts.\n\nTypes of debris include:\n\nRockets : Portions of the rocket stages used in launches and discarded in low Earth orbit.\n\n: Portions of the rocket stages used in launches and discarded in low Earth orbit. Payload : Satellites that have reached the end of their operational lives.\n\n: Satellites that have reached the end of their operational lives. Mission-related objects: Items such as hand tools, screws and nuts and bolts. One example is a tool bag that drifted away during a spacewalk in December 2023.\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nSince the beginning of space exploration in 1957, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) has collected data on space debris. It tracked Russia's first satellite, Sputnik, which launched the same year. Since then, NASA, the U.N. Office for Outer Space Affairs and the European Space Agency have tracked thousands of objects orbiting Earth.\n\nNASA estimates 17.6 million pounds − or 8,800 tons − worth of objects are in Earth orbit, according to its most current Orbital Debris Quarterly News. And the number of small satellites is expected to increase.\n\nAbout 44 tons of space debris falls into Earth’s atmosphere each day. About 95% of it burns up.\n\nWhere do you find space junk?\n\nSpace junk typically circles the planet in low Earth orbit, or within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface. Orbits are classified in three basic categories:\n\nHigh : Most weather and communications satellites, farthest from the planet's surface.\n\n: Most weather and communications satellites, farthest from the planet's surface. Medium : Navigation and specialized satellites, intended to observe a specific area.\n\n: Navigation and specialized satellites, intended to observe a specific area. Low: The majority of research satellites, such as the fleet of NASA's Earth Observing System.\n\nThere are 9,777 objects circling Earth, the majority of which are in low Earth orbit, according to the satellite tracking website Orbiting Now.\n\nWhy is space junk dangerous?\n\nThere are roughly 100 million debris fragments larger than 0.04 inches in size and about 23,000 particles larger than 4 inches in orbit.\n\nDebris can travel at 18,000 mph, according to NASA. That's 10 times faster than the speed of a bullet, so even a tiny paint chip can rupture a spacesuit or damage delicate solar arrays and electronics on a satellite.\n\nFuture and current missions can be at risk of debris strikes. There are drawbacks to maneuvering a satellite to avoid space junk: the satellite may end up in a less efficient orbit.\n\nHow does junk get into space?\n\nCountries that launch objects into space contribute to debris.\n\nSince 1957, the U.S. has launched 9,632 objects into space, according to Our World in Data. The U.S. accounted for the majority of satellites launched into orbit last year.\n\nNumber of launches in 2023:\n\nU.S. 2,166\n\n2,166 United Kingdom 144\n\n144 China 128\n\n128 Russia 62\n\n62 Luxembourg 12\n\nWhat’s the risk of being hit by a piece of falling space debris?\n\nYour risk of being injured by falling space debris is less than 1 in 100 billion, according to the European Space Agency.\n\nThat means you have better odds of winning a Powerball jackpot of any amount, at 1 in 292 million.\n\nThough that's not zero, your chances of being hit by a falling satellite are 65,000 times lower than the risk of being struck by lightning and three times lower than the risk of being struck by a meteorite, ESA says.\n\nCONTRIBUTING George Petras and Emily DeLetter, USA TODAY, C.A.

We look forward to sharing our lessons learned and operations experience with the private sector to help them develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective destinations in space,” said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at NASA Headquarters in a statement.\n\n“The report we have delivered to Congress describes, in detail, our comprehensive plan for ensuring a smooth transition to commercial destinations after retirement of the International Space Station in 2030.”\n\nSpace graveyard\n\nIn the International Space Station Transition Report, NASA said the plan was for the ISS to fall to Earth in an area known as the South Pacific Oceanic Uninhabited Area – also known as Point Nemo. The report said that its budget estimate assumed that the deorbit would happen in January 2031.\n\nNamed after the submarine sailor in Jules Verne’s novel “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,” Point Nemo is the point in the ocean that is farthest from land and has been a watery grave for many other spacecraft.\n\nThe area is approximately 3,000 miles off of New Zealand’s eastern coast and 2,000 miles north of Antarctica and it’s estimated that space-faring nations such as the US, Russia, Japan and European countries have sunk more than 263 pieces of space debris there since 1971.\n\nThe report said the ISS would perform thrusting maneuvers that would ensure “safe atmospheric entry.”\n\nThird decade\n\nThe ISS won’t rest on its laurels for the next eight years. NASA said goals for the next decade including using the ISS as “analog for a Mars transit mission,” according to the report.\n\n“The International Space Station is entering its third and most productive decade as a groundbreaking scientific platform in microgravity,” said Robyn Gatens, director of the International Space Station at NASA Headquarters, said in the statement.\n\n“This third decade is one of results, building on our successful global partnership to verify exploration and human research technologies to support deep space exploration, continue to return medical and environmental benefits to humanity, and lay the groundwork for a commercial future in low-Earth orbit.”\n\n“We look forward to maximizing these returns from the space station through 2030 while planning for transition to commercial space destinations that will follow.”\n\nThe space station has been home to many scientific firsts. The first item to be 3D-printed on the space station occurred in 2014. NASA astronaut Kate Rubins sequenced DNA in space for the first time in 2016. And the fifth state of matter, called a Bose-Einstein condensate, was produced in space by NASA’s Cold Atom Lab on the station in 2018.\n\nAstronauts have learned how to grow lettuces and leafy greens in space. The first space-grown salad was sampled by astronauts in 2015. Now, they’re even growing radishes and chilis on the station. This could be used to one day help astronauts grow their own food on deep space missions.\n\nChina, whose astronauts have long been excluded from the ISS, launched the first module of its planned space station last year. While not as large as the ISS, the Chinese space station is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year.\n\nRussia has said it will leave the ISS project in 2025 and plans to build its own space station that could launch in 2030.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}]}

Kennedy Jr., Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services , has accused him of groping her when she was 23. Kennedy, a member of one of America’s most storied political dynasties, said he had no memory of the alleged assault but apologized to the woman “for anything I ever did that made you feel uncomfortable.”\n\nKennedy’s accuser, Eliza Cooney, said his apology wasn’t really an apology at all. “I don’t know if it’s an apology if you say, ‘I don’t remember,’” she said in an interview with USA TODAY.\n\nMore:Exclusive: Former babysitter to RFK Jr.'s kids speaks about sexual assault allegation\n\nThree other men who Trump has nominated for prominent positions in his incoming administration also have faced sexual misconduct accusations, raising questions about their past and complicating their pathway to government service.\n\nPete Hegseth, Trump’s choice for defense secretary, paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of sexual assault, his attorney acknowledged this week. Hegseth denied the allegation and was never charged. His attorney said the Army National Guard veteran paid the woman because he feared losing his job as a commentator on Fox News.\n\nMatt Gaetz, a former Florida congressman who Trump has tapped as attorney general, has been under investigation for three years by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, who denies the allegations, resigned from his House seat shortly after Trump nominated him to become the nation’s top law-enforcement officer – just days before the Ethics Committee was to release its investigative report. On Thursday, he withdrew his nomination, saying it had become a distraction for Trump's transition team.\n\nElon Musk, the world's richest man who Trump has asked to help spearhead a new initiative on government efficiency, was sued in June by eight former employees of his aerospace company, SpaceX, a major federal contractor. The suit alleges that Musk and his company treated women “as sexual objects to be evaluated on their bra size” and described an “Animal House” workplace environment in which lewd sexual banter was common and those who complained were told to look for a job elsewhere.\n\nBy giving jobs in his incoming administration to other men accused of sexual misconduct, Trump is “kind of putting up his middle finger to everyone who has talked about his own behavior with women,” said Julian Zelizer, a history professor at Princeton University and author of the book, \"The Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\"\n\nTrump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump himself is no stranger to allegations of sexual impropriety. Nineteen women have accused him of sexual misconduct going back as far as the 1970s. Last year, a federal jury found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation of author E. Jean Carroll, who said Trump sexually assaulted her in a New York department store nearly three decades ago. Trump denied the allegations, but the jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages. He has appealed the award.\n\nThe verdict was a rare rebuke of Trump, who has managed to confound his accusers at almost every turn. Trump's appeals against the Carroll verdicts are ongoing and it's unclear if and how his presidential election might affect them.\n\nIn 2016, Trump successfully used his career as a New York businessman and reality TV star as a springboard to the presidency, even with the sexual misconduct allegations hanging over him. Just weeks before the election, an Access Hollywood videotape surfaced in which he made of boast about grabbing women by their genitals. He won anyway, defeating the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, in a stunning upset.\n\nTrump’s decision to put four men accused of sexual misconduct in prominent government positions is \"just the president-elect saying one more time he will do what he wants to do,” Zelizer said. “He doesn’t care about convention. He doesn’t care about perceptions and norms. This is him asserting himself, as he does all the time.”\n\nMore:Who has Trump picked for his Cabinet so far? Dr. Mehmet Oz among latest picks\n\nA national conversation about sexual harassment and abuse\n\nTrump is not the first public figure to face public accusations of sexual misconduct and survive. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas won Senate confirmation in 1991 despite allegations by one of his advisers, attorney Anita Hill, that he had sexually harassed her. Thomas’ confirmation hearing triggered a national conversation about harassment of women in the workplace and served as a precursor to the “#MeToo” movement that would focus even more attention on the issue.\n\nTwenty-seven years after Thomas’ hearing mesmerized the nation, one of Trump’s Supreme Court nominees, Brett Kavanaugh, would be confronted during his confirmation hearing with allegations that he had sexually assaulted a woman in the early 1980s. Like Thomas, Kavanaugh denied the allegations and won Senate confirmation.\n\nOther prominent figures in entertainment and politics have lost their jobs or were forced to resign amid allegations of sexual misconduct. The fallen include governors (New York’s Eliot Spitzer and Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey’s Jim McGreevey), senators (Bob Packwood of Oregon, Larry Craig of Idaho and Al Franken of Minnesota) and congressmen (Anthony Weiner of New York, Mark Foley of Florida and Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina).\n\nEven the mere suggestion of sexual mischief was once enough to subject a politician to public ridicule. Devout Christian Jimmy Carter confessed to Playboy magazine during his 1976 presidential campaign that he had lusted in his heart after women who were not his wife. A political cartoonist responded with a drawing showing Carter lasciviously leering at the Statue of Liberty. Carter said the fallout nearly cost him the election.\n\nThe allegations against Trump’s four nominees are far more serious than unrequited lust.\n\nEver since Trump announced that he had picked Gaetz to serve as his attorney general, new details have emerged daily about allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use against the former congressman.\n\nFlorida Attorney Joel Leppard told ABC News he represents two women who testified to the House Ethics Committee that Gaetz paid them for sex through Venmo. One witness said she saw Gaetz having sex with her then 17-year-old friend at an Orlando house party in July 2017.\n\nCourt documents in a spin-off defamation lawsuit reference sealed testimony that refers to Gaetz at the same party where there was “alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy, also known as molly, and marijuana.” Those documents could also become public after they were reportedly snatched by a hacker.\n\nThe Justice Department investigated the allegations against Gaetz but declined to bring any charges against him, which Gaetz says shows they are false. But the Ethics Committee report or damaging witness testimony that could be leaked had the potential to derail Gaetz’s nomination.\n\n“Paying for sex is concerning, providing drugs to a minor is problematic and having sex with a minor is disqualifying for a potential attorney general of the United States,” a source close to the House Ethics and a separate Department of Justice investigation said. “We don’t think of our attorney general as participating in those kinds of activities.”\n\nMore:House Ethics Committee doesn't agree to release highly anticipated Matt Gaetz report after investigation\n\nIn the case of the allegations against Hegseth, city officials in Monterey, California, confirmed last week that Trump’s nominee to lead the nation’s fighting forces was involved in an investigation into an alleged sexual assault in 2017.\n\nA woman who claims she was sexually assaulted by Hegseth told police she remembered him preventing her from leaving a room at the Hyatt Hotel and that he was on top of her, according to newly released documents obtained late Wednesday by USA TODAY.\n\nThe woman recounted her hazy memories of the encounter but told police she said “no” a lot and that Hegseth swiped away her phone and blocked the door with his body, according to the documents from the Monterey Police Department. The 30-year-old woman, identified only as Jane Doe, told police she had been drinking Champagne and believed someone may have slipped something into her drink.\n\nNo charges were filed against Hegseth. His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the police investigation showed that Hegseth’s accuser was the aggressor but that he paid her an undisclosed sum as part of a settlement agreement after she threatened litigation in 2020.\n\nAs for Musk, the lawsuit filed by the former SpaceX employees carried a 31-page attachment that included dozens of pages of the billionaire businessman’s posts on the social media platform X, which he also owns. The lawsuit, a copy of which was reviewed by USA TODAY, said the posts inappropriately targeted groups of people and individuals.\n\nIn one post, for example, Musk announced his idea to create a Texas university similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) but noted his institution would be called “TITS” and that “Ds (women’s bra size) would get degrees,” the lawsuit said. Another post was accompanied by an altered photo rendering a rocket to appear to be a giant penis. Other posts included sexual innuendo, references to male genitals and comments about transgender people’s use of pronouns.\n\nAt least four other private lawsuits have been brought against SpaceX in California alleging sexual harassment or discrimination. In one case, filed in March, a woman alleged that her supervisor (not Musk) began a forced sexual relationship with her in 2019 that resulted in a child. The suit said SpaceX attempted to help the former supervisor avoid paying child support even after leaving the company in 2022.\n\nThe news website Business Insider reported that same year that it had documents relating to accusations that Musk propositioned a massage therapist for sex and exposed himself to her. Musk denied the allegations, telling the publication, “If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.”\n\nSpaceX did not respond to a USA TODAY request for comment.\n\n'My favorite president':Donald Trump and the art of rekindling world leader bromances\n\n'An inflection point'\n\nCooney, the former babysitter who said Kennedy groped her, said she feels a sense of responsibility to share her story so people can make whatever decision they want to make about the nominee. She's not trying to derail his nomination, she said. She just wants to give women courage to share their own experiences with other men.\n\n“I know that there are hardworking people who don’t have skeletons in their closet,” she said. “And I wish we were electing people with fewer skeletons in their closet.”\n\nJuliet Williams, professor of gender studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the allegations against the four accused nominees should disqualify them from serving in Trump’s administration.\n\n“This tells us that a prime target in the Trump culture war is going to be people who stand up against sexual abuse and sexual violence,” she said. “And, to me, that is disgraceful that any major political party, let alone the president of the United States, would make that the centerpiece of his agenda.”\n\nWilliams and Lorraine Bayard de Volo, a professor of women and gender studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder, see Trump’s willingness to nominate men accused of sexual misconduct as part of a larger backlash against the “#MeToo” movement. \"#MeToo\" gained widespread attention in 2017 and caused many powerful men to lose their jobs and, in some cases, go to jail. Critics argue the movement went too far and sullied the reputations of men for sexual overtures that don’t amount to assault.\n\nBayard de Volo said she fears Trump’s nominations could discourage women from reporting sexual harassment or abuse. Already, most women who face sexual harassment or assault don’t report the abuse, she said, because they don’t trust the justice system to punish their assailants. With Trump’s nominees, “the message trickled down will be one that kind of confirms those fears,” she said.\n\nWilliams said she has been struck by how many of her students – young women in their late teens and early 20s – are shocked that a majority of Americans would elect a president with Trump’s record of sexual misconduct accusations.

John Thune, R-S.D., as the next Senate majority leader after rejecting public overtures from Trump allies who backed a different candidate.\n\nThune won in a secret-ballot, beating out opposing candidates Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla. Scott had the support of prominent Trump allies including Elon Musk, Tucker Carlson and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nThe 63-year-old Thune will succeed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has led his chamber's Republicans since 2007 and is the longest-serving Senate party leader in U.S. history.\n\nThe Senate majority leader is one of the most powerful people in Washington – and soon will have an important say over Trump's agenda. Thune will have the power to set the schedule for the Senate, which has sole control over confirmation of the Cabinet, about 1,200 other high-level government jobs and a president's judicial nominees.\n\nIn other big news on Wednesday, multiple media networks made their official calls that House Republicans would maintain their majority in 2025 and the GOP conference in a unanimous voice vote endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to return as their leader next year as the GOP prepares to govern alongside Trump and with complete control of Washington's main power levers.\n\nLive updates as Biden, Trump to meetat White House: What to know, how to watch\n\nMatt Gaetz resigns from Congress after Trump taps him for attorney general\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday that Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has resigned \"effective immediately.\"\n\nTrump announced on Wednesday that he's nominating Gaetz to serve as attorney general in his second term, a move that raised eyebrows even among some of his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\n- Marina Pitofsky\n\nHouse Republicans agree to change rules protecting speaker\n\nTwo factions of the House Republican conference that have often been at odds with one another - the House Freedom Caucus and the Main Street Caucus - have agreed to a rule change that could protect Speaker Mike Johnson from an insurgent push to topple him.\n\nAt issue is a procedural tool that Rep. Matt Gaetz and other conservatives used to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and has often been blamed as a source of the chaos in the chamber for the last two years.\n\nBecause any one member can force a vote to oust the Speaker, each member has more leverage than is typical. Now, that threshold would be raised to nine members.\n\nThe agreement would be formalized at the beginning of the next Congress in January, when members rewrite their own rules.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\n5 takeaways from the Matt Gaetz attorney general nomination\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's choice of Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general signaled a like-minded approach to overhauling the Justice Department after both men were investigated criminally.\n\nBut the choice also sparked some of the first criticism of Trump's cabinet selections, as senators questioned whether the Florida Republican would be a serious choice to become the country's top law enforcement official.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's five takeaways from the surprising announcement.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\n5 takeaways from Trump's return to DC\n\nTrump met with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office for nearly two hours on Wednesday as the outgoing president did what Trump wouldn't four years ago − extend a helping hand and embrace a peaceful transfer of power. Trump addressed congressional Republicans earlier in the day on Capitol Hill.\n\nThe image of Trump sitting next to Biden, shaking hands, marked an extraordinary moment that crystallized Trump's remarkable comeback: from a twice-impeached, four-times-indicted former president − whose supporters waged a violent insurrection at the Capitol − to the soon-to-be 47th president.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's five takeaways from the president-elect's swing through DC.\n\n- Joey Garrison\n\nAfter Trump endorsement, GOP backs Mike Johnson for second term as House speaker\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday endorsed Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana to return as their leader next year as the GOP prepares to govern alongside President-elect Donald Trump and with complete control of Washington's main power levers.\n\nJohnson's win isn't surprising. He ran unopposed and there were no objections before the unanimous voice vote.\n\nIt's also not the final say on the matter. Johnson still must notch a majority of votes from the 435-person chamber during a public floor vote in early January that will keep him in a job that also means he's second in line for the presidency after Vice President-elect JD Vance.\n\n- Karissa Waddick and Riley Beggin\n\nDemocratic senator 'speechless' over Gaetz nomination\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., said he was “speechless” over Trump's decision to nominate Florida GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general.“I look forward to the confirmation hearings, to hearing their views and reviewing their qualifications and considering,” said Coons.Asked whether his Republican colleagues would go along with Trump’s picks, Coons said the choice is “up to them.”“That's the choice they're going to have to make. Our system works when the guardrails work, which requires both the courts and the Congress to work. The confirmation process requires us to review thoroughly and seriously the appropriateness, qualifications, character of nominees. I hope we will do so,” Coons said.— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump chooses firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz to run Justice Department as attorney general\n\nTrump announced Wednesday he chose Rep. Matt Gaetz, a firebrand lawmaker who has been a harsh critic of the Justice Department even as he was investigated by it, as attorney general.\n\nThe Florida Republican has been a vocal critic of the department from his seat on the Judiciary Committee and a staunch defender of Trump. Gaetz accused Attorney General Merrick Garland of weaponizing the department and said he agreed with special counsel Robert Hur's decision not to charge President Joe Biden for mishandling classified documents because he was \"senile.\" Gaetz also accused FBI Director Christopher Wray of being \"blissfully ignorant\" about how agents ran their investigations.\n\nGaetz demonstrated his willingness to fight the Washington establishment by opposing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and nearly scuffling with other lawmakers on the House floor during the dispute. Gaetz fended off a Republican primary challenge this year from a rival McCarthy supported.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump picks Tulsi Gabbard as his director of national intelligence\n\nTrump on Wednesday picked former congresswoman and Army veteran Tulsi Gabbard as his nominee for director of national intelligence, a cabinet-level post.\n\n\"I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nGabbard was a Democrat when she served in the House of Representatives from Hawaii from 2013 to 2021. She ran for president in the Democratic primary in 2020 before leaving the party in 2022 and becoming a Republican this year.\n\n- Tom Vanden Brook and Erin Mansfield\n\nCornyn: Senate will ‘have some questions’ for Gaetz\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said that senators will have a responsibility to seriously consider Matt Gaetz and any other nominees from President-elect Trump.\n\n“I assume we’ll have some questions for him,” Cornyn told reporters Wednesday when asked about the Florida congressman whom Trump announced he'd nominee to be attorney general.\n\nAsked about the House Ethics Committee's investigation into Gaetz for sexual misconduct, Cornyn said, “Well that might come up,”\n\n“I don’t know whether there’s any basis to it or not,” Cornyn said. “So I’m sure we’ll be asking a lot of questions.”\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump AG nominee Gaetz was probed in sex trafficking investigation\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who president-elect Donald Trump picked as his attorney general Wednesday, is being probed by the House Ethics Committee as a part of an ongoing investigation that includes allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus member and close Trump ally was also under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for allegations that he had sexual relations with a minor and paid for her travel and allegedly was introduced to him by a Joel Greenberg, a one-time friend who is serving an 11-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to sex trafficking in 2022. In February 2023, the DOJ ended the investigation without charging Gaetz.\n\n- Sam Woodward and Karissa Waddick\n\nMarco Rubio given nod for Secretary of State\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday confirmed he's chosen Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., to serve as Secretary of State in his next administration.\n\nRubio has deep foreign policy experience and has transformed from a Trump opponent to a close ally who was a finalist to serve as Trump's vice president.\n\nHe is currently the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee and serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio, a Cuban American, would be the first Latino person to serve as Secretary of State.\n\nRubio has expressed support for Ukraine's war effort against Russia, but voted against additional aid for the country last year. He recently said the war in Ukraine is going to end with \"a negotiated settlement,\" something Trump has also supported. He's also advocated for a tough approach to American adversaries like China, Russia, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela.Trump and Rubio, 53, ran against each other in the 2016 Republican primary, which turned nasty as they lobbed insults at each other. But they patched up their relationship and worked together on shared foreign policy goals during Trump’s first administration. They grew closer during the 2024 campaign, when Rubio was on the short list to be Trump’s running mate and campaigned relentlessly for him.\n\nA fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants who grew up in West Miami. He adds diversity to Trump’s Cabinet and foreign policy chops. A senator since 2011, he serves on the Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees and has been one of the most outspoken lawmakers on confronting China and U.S. adversaries around the world.\n\nRubio is expected to easily gain Senate confirmation, with lawmakers from both parties already announcing their support for his nomination.\n\n- Riley Beggin and Zac Anderson\n\nMark Warner says he'll evaluate Cabinet nominees on individual basis\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said he will evaluate at Trump's cabinet nominees on an individual basis. But he does have a preference for the next Secretary of State.\n\n\"I don't want to jump in front of the president-elect,\" Warner told reporters Wednesday. \"But should he go ahead and nominate my friend Marco Rubio? I think that'd be a very strong choice.\"\n\nTogether, Warner and Rubio serve as chair and vice-chair of the House intelligence committee.\n\nRubio is expected to be named as Trump's pick for the position, according to reports from CNN and New York Times.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nGOP wins control of the House\n\nRepublicans have won both the House and the Senate, giving the GOP total control over Congress for at least the next two years and creating a friendly path for President-elect Donald Trump's priorities.\n\nThe GOP will have a majority in the 435-member House after defending enough key seats in New York, California and other swing districts that had appeared more competitive before Election Day than they ultimately were, according to multiple networks tracking the results. Republicans also have taken control of the Senate by toppling Democratic senators in Montana and Ohio and prevailing in other closely watched races.\n\nTheir victory sets up a Republican trifecta in Washington for the next two years, laying the groundwork for Trump and the party to implement their priorities without major resistance.\n\nJohn Thune will be next Senate Majority Leader\n\nSen. John Thune will be the next Senate Majority Leader. He won 29-24 in a secret ballot election.- Riley Beggin\n\nTrump backers lament Thune's election as Senate majority leader\n\nTrump hasn't said anything - yet - but allies are already squawking about John Thune's election as Senate Republican majority leader.\n\nTrump World has feuded for years with Thune, seeing him as a clone of frequent Trump critic Mitch McConnell. Trump himself tried, unsuccessfully, to field a GOP primary challenger to Thune in 2022.\n\nThe president-elect did not weigh in on the Senate majority leader race, but prominent allies campaigned against Thune in favor of Florida Senator Rick Scott.\n\nAfter Thune prevailed, Trump backer Charlie Kirk said on X that Thune \"has a short window to show us he will support President Trump, fill his cabinet, confirm his judges, and pass his agenda.\"\n\n\"If he does, we will support him,\" Kirk said. \"If he doesn't, we will work to remove him.\"\n\nBuckle up.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nRick Scott is out on the first ballot in the election for the Senate majority leader\n\nScott received the fewest votes in the secret ballot election despite a public pressure campaign from conservative media and Trump allies.\n\nNow senators will move into a second round of votes to determine whether Sen. John Cornyn or Sen. John Thune will be the next leader.\n\n- Riley Beggin\n\nGOP lawmakers enthused about Department of Government Efficiency\n\nRepublican lawmakers expressed support for the new Department of Goverment Efficiency, to be headed by businessmen Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n“I think it's one of the most important things that we can take on in this next administration,” said Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. “With our federal debt approaching $36 trillion this has created the inflation crisis in America. I fully support it,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said.\n\nRep. Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told reporters that while he supports the new department, he expects Congress will push back.\n\n“Congress always needs to do oversight, so we always need to protect our authority, right?” said Guthrie. “And so there, I assume whatever they suggest, they'll be statutory changes that we'll need to make, and then obviously, Congress will have a role…if there's anything that we feel requires change of statute, then Congress will have its role definitely.”\n\n— Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRepublicans say they will red stamp Trump’s agenda\n\nDressed in a red Trump tie and $399 gold Trump sneakers, Rep. Troy Nehls said that if it weren’t for Trump, the GOP would have lost the House.\n\n“His mission and his goals and objectives, whatever that is, we need to embrace all of it, every single word,” Nehls said.\n\nFor leaders in the House, Nehls said that means, “if Donald Trump says, jump three feet high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch our head.”\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nWill Speaker Johnson face opposition?\n\nRep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said she expects Speaker Mike Johnson to face opposition for his gavel but would not say which members exactly would be the ones to challenge him.\n\n“It’s a big game of trust and there’s not a lot of trust in Washington,” Luna told reporters leaving House Republicans’ meeting with Trump Wednesday morning.\n\n“Hopefully though everyone can unify behind the president’s agenda,” she continued.\n\nLuna declined to say how she would be casting her vote for leadership.\n\n— Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump arrives on the Hill\n\nTrump arrived at the Hyatt Hotel for his meeting with Congressional Republicans at 10 a.m.\n\nHis motorcade pulled into the back of the hotel.\n\nTrump is expected to meet with Joe Biden at the White House at 11 a.m.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nJack Smith to step down as special counsel investigating Trump, reports say\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, plans to step down before the president-elect takes office, the New York Times reported citing people familiar with Smith's plans. Smith and his team plan to finish their work and exit before Trump can make good his pledge to fire Smith within “two seconds” of being sworn in. CNN also reported the move, citing a Justice Department official familiar with the discussions.\n\nSmith's case involving classified documents Trump kept after leaving office was dismissed by a federal judge in Florida, but Smith's team has filed an appeal. In a case in Washington charging Trump with conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, Smith asked for and received a monthlong pause to the filing deadlines. The Justice Department is working to determine how to proceed in both cases, but department policy has been against prosecuting sitting presidents.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSome Republicans aren’t concerned about narrow House majority\n\nReps. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and Michael Lawler, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY that they aren’t worried about a narrow GOP majority in the House as Trump taps GOP members for cabinet roles. Lawler acknowledged that the margin will be \"very tight\" until those moving into administration roles are replaced.\n\n“Ultimately, I think if we are focused on addressing the major issues, I would imagine there will also be Democrats voting in favor of legislation,\" Lawler said. \"It won't really be that much of an issue.\"\n\nHe added that Trump was picking “really solid members who will do a great job in the administration.”\n\nSome of Trump’s picks include Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., as U.N. ambassador and Rep. Mike Walz, R-Fla., as national security advisor. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is also expected to be named secretary of state, according to reports from CNN and The New York Times.\n\nStefanik and Walz's House seats will have to be filled by holding special elections, while Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis would decide who gets the Senate seat if Rubio is chosen.\n\nRoy also said he isn’t too worried and is waiting to see what happens in the House special elections. As for Rubio’s spot, he’s optimistic.\n\n“The Senate, of course, they can do an immediate appointment, so that's not as big of a deal,” Roy said. “Absolutely, that'll be immediately filled. So as long as you fill it with a good person, which in this case, I know Governor DeSantis will pick somebody awesome for the Senate.”\n\nMelania Trump won't visit White House with Donald Trump\n\nMelania Trump is skipping the tea. A day after it became clear that Donald Trump would return as president after his decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden invited the president-elect and his wife to the White House.\n\nDonald Trump accepted the invitation the same day, saying through his spokesperson that he \"looked forward to the meeting.\" Melania Trump remained silent.

Kristi Noem to be his secretary of Homeland Security, selecting another loyalist to lead an agency central to his efforts to crack down on the number of immigrants who enter the country without permission. In a statement late Tuesday, Trump heralded Noem for deploying her state's National Guard to the southern border. He said that she would work closely with his newly appointed \"border czar\" to secure the United States' southern border.\n\nNoem said in a statement she was \"honored and humbled\" by the appointment, which will require Senate confirmation. \"I look forward to working with Border Czar Tom Homan to make America SAFE again,\" she said. \"With Donald Trump, we will secure the Border, and restore safety to American communities so that families will again have the opportunity to pursue The American Dream.”\n\n− Joey Garrison, Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump taps South Dakota Gov.

Kennedy Jr., Matt Gaetz, Marco Rubio and Tulsi Gabbard to the list of those he wants to lead departments during his administration. He has also has given nods to those with connections to Tennessee.\n\nTrump announced Tuesday his choice of Pete Hegseth for Secretary of Defense in the Cabinet and also named former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who hosts a weekly talk show on Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) which is filmed in Hendersonville, as the Ambassador to Israel.\n\nMore names are sure to come as 2024 closes out and Trump's second and last term as president begins. Here's a look at who has been named and which seats will need to be filled.\n\nWho else has Trump nominated for heads of government agencies?\n\nAll together, Trump has nominated 11 people for roles in the highest positions that oversee multiple agencies in the United States government.\n\nHere are the latest positions that Trump has named as of Friday, Nov. 15:\n\nWho is Matt Gaetz? What does the Attorney General do?\n\nFormer Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., has been tapped by Trump for the role of U.S. Attorney General. Gaetz, a staunch MAGA supporter, resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives on Wednesday \"effective immediately,\" after receiving the nod from Trump.\n\nThe Florida lawyer has been a member of the U.S. House of Representatives since 2017 and won re-election for his seat, which now has to be filled.\n\nThe resignation also put an end to the House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz.\n\nThe Ethics Committee has spent three years looking into a variety of claims that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illegal drug use, accepted “improper gifts” and gave out special favors. Gaetz denied the allegations. The panel was set to decide if their report on the issue would be made public on Friday, but the investigation was ended as soon as Gaetz resigned.\n\nMultiple lawmakers have called for the information to be released, especially since Gaetz is tapped for this high position and could make a difference during Senate confirmation hearings.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate as U.S. Attorney General, Gaetz would head of the Justice Department, which he has been critical of in the past. He would also represent the United States in legal matters and give advice and opinions to the president and the heads of the executive departments of the government when needed.\n\n“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, according to USA TODAY. \"We need to have a serious attorney general and I’m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody who is serious.\"\n\nWho is Tulsi Gabbard? What is DNI?\n\nFormer Hawaii GOP Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democrat who ran for the presidential nomination in 2020 and ultimately endorsed President Joe Biden but then became a Trump supporter, was named as Trump's choice for the Department of National Intelligence.\n\n\"I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nGabbard, 43, is an American Samoan native who was a rising star in the Democratic Party before her departure in 2022. She was an Army officer who had deployed to the Middle East and later became a critic of the Iraq War which helped her gain credibility with progressives, according to reports from USA TODAY.\n\nGabbard's intelligence experience is nominal compared to the current director, Avril Haines, who was a deputy CIA director and deputy national security advisor before taking on the position. Besides her time in politics, Gabbard was in the National Guard and deployed during the Iraq War with a field medical unit and later returned to the Middle East as an officer to lead a military police platoon and as a trainer for the Kuwait National Guard's counterterrorism unit.\n\nIf she is confirmed by the Senate, Gabbard would be in charge of 18 agencies, including the National Security Agency, the FBI and CIA.\n\nWho is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.? What is HHS?\n\nOn Thursday, Trump announced his nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the department that oversees the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention among others.\n\n\"The safety and health of all Americans is the most important role of any administration, and HHS will play a big role in helping ensure that everybody will be protected from harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives that have contributed to the overwhelming health crisis in this country,\" Trump said in a statement on X.\n\nKennedy, 70, is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, brother to President John F. Kennedy and former Attorney General, whose run for president in 1968 was cut short when he was assassinated in Los Angeles, California.\n\nAn environmental lawyer, Kennedy also ran for president this year as a third-party candidate before withdrawing and throwing his support behind Trump. He rose to national prominence partly due to his opposition to vaccines — including vaccines for childhood measles, mumps and rubella — based on his claims that they were linked to autism. He also opposed COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic.\n\nKennedy has also opposed the Food and Drug Administration, warning on X last month that the organization's \"war on public health is about to end.\" He called the FDA's decisions regarding psychedelics, raw milk, hydroxychloroquine, stem cells and ivermectin, among others, \"aggressive suppression.\"\n\nWho is Pete Hegseth? Does he have ties to Tennessee?\n\nHegseth is a conservative media pundit given the nod this week for the role of Secretary of Defense under Trump. At the news of his nomination, Hegseth stepped away from his role at Fox News which he has been with since 2014.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Trump touted his unorthodox candidate's time in service as an Army combat veteran and his belief that Hegseth could handle one of the top positions in America's government.\n\n\"With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\" Trump wrote in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nHegseth's military career included serving as an infantry officer in the Army National Guard with deployments to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay. Hegseth also served as CEO of Concerned Veterans for America.\n\nHegseth and his family also call Middle Tennessee home.\n\nThey moved to Sumner County, just outside of Nashville, approximately two years ago and, in 2023, Hegseth hosted the 5th annual Fox Nation Patriot Awards at the Grand Ole Opry House.\n\nHow many cabinet positions does Trump still need to fill?\n\nThere are still 13 positions that Trump has not announced nominations for. Here's what still needs to be filled:\n\nDepartment of the Treasury Secretary\n\nDepartment of Agriculture Secretary\n\nDepartment of Commerce Secretary\n\nDepartment of Labor Secretary\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Secretary\n\nDepartment of Transportation Secretary\n\nDepartment of Energy Secretary\n\nDepartment of Education Secretary\n\nUnited States Trade Representative\n\nChair of the Council of Economic Advisers\n\nAdministrator of the Small Business Affairs\n\nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget\n\nDirector of the Office of Science and Technology Policy\n\nUSA TODAY contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/12/02/trump-cabinet-fbi-kash-patel/76716462007/", "title": "Who has Trump picked for his Cabinet? Patel eyed as FBI head", "text": "President-elect Donald Trump continues to add controversial figures to his incoming administration.\n\nThe latest pick is that of former Republican House staffer and staunch Trump supporter Kashyap “Kash” Patel to potentially assume the role of Federal Bureau of Investigation director.\n\nTrump would have to fire current FBI director Christopher Wray in order for Patel to be formally nominated to the role. Wray, a first-term Trump appointment, is more than halfway through the 10-year term he was confirmed to in 2017.\n\nPatel has signaled that his agenda would prioritize the destruction of the so-called “deep state,” or longtime members of the national security bureaucracy.\n\nPatel is the latest in a string of Cabinet picks who are likely to face bruising confirmation hearings despite Republican control of the Senate. In response, Trump has floated the demand that GOP leadership allow for recess appointments as an end-around of the confirmation process.\n\nTrump has also named Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister to lead the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, key in the incoming administration's focus on fentanyl trafficking that has already inflamed tensions with Mexico.\n\nHere are the latest picks in for the Trump administration.\n\nPotential FBI head hardline MAGA pick\n\nPatel is a former prosecutor and was rumored to be on tap for a prominent national security role after serving in the previous administration. Patel was the chief of staff at the Department of Defense, deputy director of National Intelligence and senior director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council.\n\nHe has been a vocal MAGA spokesperson between the administrations, often echoing Trump's calls for vengeance.\n\nPatel pushed the false claim of a rigged election in 2020 and promised retribution against those in the media in a 2023 episode of a podcast hosted by far-right political strategist Steve Bannon.\n\n\"We’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig Presidential elections,\" Patel said. \"Whether it’s criminally or civilly, we’ll figure that out.\"\n\nDEA pick tied to Attorney General nominee\n\nTrump tapped Chronister to lead the DEA, describing him as a “proud graduate of the FBI National Academy” and co-chairman of the Regional Domestic Security Task Force for the Tampa region in Florida.\n\nChronister appears to be close to Pam Bondi, the former two-term Florida attorney general who Trump has tapped to be Attorney General, the highest law enforcement official in the nation and head of the Justice Department, which oversees the DEA. Chronister served as a member of the Florida Attorney General’s Statewide Council on Human Trafficking.\n\nTrump signed an executive order during his first term in the White House granting a full pardon to Chronister's father-in-law, Edward DeBartolo Jr., for his involvement in a gambling fraud case in Louisiana in the late 1990s.\n\nIf confirmed by the Senate, Chronister would replace President Joe Biden’s DEA administrator, Anne Milgram, a former New Jersey attorney general who is credited with aggressively combatting the trafficking and sale of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is more than 50 times more powerful than heroin.\n\nTrump's Cabinet picks\n\nNotable Trump administration picks\n\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Sarah D.

We have to counter Russia’s aggression, put ourselves in the best possible position to outcompete China, and work for greater stability in a consequential region of the world,” Biden wrote Saturday in an op-ed for The Washington Post.\n\n“To do these things, we have to engage directly with countries that can impact those outcomes. Saudi Arabia is one of them, and when I meet with Saudi leaders on Friday, my aim will be to strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that’s based on mutual interests and responsibilities, while also holding true to fundamental American values,” he added.\n\nThe President’s visit has drawn criticism given that US intelligence has deemed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman responsible for ordering the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi. As a candidate for President, Biden had pledged to make the kingdom a “pariah.”\n\nIn his op-ed, Biden also said he will be focused on a more integrated and stable Middle East, calling the region “essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on” while also noting how critical Middle East energy supplies are in light of sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“And a region that’s coming together through diplomacy and cooperation – rather than coming apart through conflict – is less likely to give rise to violent extremism that threatens our homeland or new wars that could place new burdens on U.S. military forces and their families,” Biden said.\n\nBiden tacitly criticized his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, for abandoning the Iran nuclear deal and said his administration will “continue to increase diplomatic and economic pressure until Iran is ready to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal, as I remain prepared to do.”\n\nThe President is also set to travel to Israel during the visit.

PETE BEACH, Fla. – President Joe Biden on Sunday visited Florida for the second time in a little more than a week to tour storm-ravaged communities as the state grappled with hundreds of thousands of power outages, gas shortages and persistent flooding in the wake of deadly Hurricane Milton.\n\nAfter an aerial tour over stretches of battered coastline and the shredded roof of Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Biden delivered remarks in St. Pete Beach, one of the many communities along the west-central coast of Florida reeling after the one-two punch of hurricanes Helene and Milton.\n\nBiden said while the state avoided the worst-case scenario, Milton wrought widespread destruction, submerging entire neighborhoods under several feet of floodwater, destroying homes, and killing at least 17 people.\n\n\"Thankfully, the storm impact was not as cataclysmic as we'd predicted,\" Biden said. \"But for some individuals, it was cataclysmic. All those folks who not only lost their homes but more importantly those folks who lost their lives, lost family members, lost all their personal belongings.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Biden approved a disaster declaration that will free up federal funding for people affected by Milton, including grants for temporary housing, home repairs, and loans. On Sunday, Biden said that since he signed the declaration, more than 250,000 Floridians registered for help – \"the most in a single day ever in the history of this country.\"\n\nThe president announced an additional $612 million to support communities displaced by recent hurricanes, which includes $47 million for Gainesville Regional Utilities and another $47 million for Florida Power and Light to help restore electricity and \"make the region's power system stronger and more capable.\"\n\n\"This is all a team effort, folks. You made a big difference and have saved lives,\" Biden said at the close of his remarks. \"But there's much more to do. And we're going to do everything we can to get power back in your home, not only helping you recover, but to help you build back stronger.\"\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾ Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has directed 2,800 workers to remove debris over the next 90 days after Biden agreed to reimburse the state 100% of the costs. DeSantis called the debris removal effort \"unprecedented\" and said the state would \"step up\" and help cities and counties.\n\n◾ The National Weather Service confirmed Martin County was hit by two tornadoes that spun off from Milton — an EF1 tornado in Port Salerno and an EF2 tornado in Hobe Sound and Port Salerno. Officials from the weather service in Melbourne have been assessing damage daily across the Treasure Coast from tornadoes embedded in Milton’s outer bands of rain.\n\n'Everyone is okay here': Fort Myers Beach lifts curfew\n\nThe curfew previously put in place from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. for Fort Myers Beach, Florida, has been lifted, town officials said Sunday. Officials also announced that hurricane reentry passes were no longer needed to re-enter the island.\n\n\"Now that most of the sand and debris have been cleared from the roads and power has been restored to majority of the island, we feel comfortable lifting the (pass program),\" town spokesperson Nicole Berzin said in a news release.\n\nThe island saw roughly 6 feet of storm surge, which left behind tons of sand covering streets, and filling some homes and businesses as the water receded. While Fort Myers Beach will still need to do the work to clean up after Milton, business owners' and residents' outlooks were positive.\n\nGrant Erickson, part-owner of Erickson & Jensen Seafood Packers, said his beach dock and business had weathered the storm well. Fearing the worst, and remembering the punishment Hurricane Ian doled out to the shrimp fleet in the waters of Lee County, he sent all his boats away – some up the river, past the locks. Others took refuge in Key West.\n\nOn Sunday, he said the docks held together very well, and all four boats sent up the river survived. The two in Key West did fine as well, he said, as did those riding out the storm on the 200-ton steel beasts.\n\n\"Everyone is okay here,\" Erickson said.\n\n— Kate Cimini, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nEnergy secretary: Florida power will be restored by Tuesday\n\nFull power restoration is expected in Florida by Tuesday evening, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who was traveling with Biden. That's probably longer than the approximately 720,000 still-powerless customers want to wait, but it would mean all blackouts would be solved less than a week after Milton hit Wednesday night.\n\nMore than 200,000 homes and businesses got their power back Sunday, as tens of thousands of linemen from 43 states and Canada have been working to restore electricity, Biden said, after Milton left about 3 million Floridians in the dark.\n\nHillsborough County, which includes Tampa, is currently reporting the most outages in the state with over 212,000 homes and businesses, according to a USA TODAY power outage tracker. The next highest is Pinellas County, home to St. Petersburg and Clearwater, with more than 102,000.\n\nStorm tracker:Tropical Storm Leslie weakens as next storm to form will be Nadine\n\nRising floodwaters after Milton threaten neighborhoods across Florida\n\nMilton's deluge continued to afflict communities on Sunday as officials warned of floodwaters and bulging rivers that are expected to rise further in the coming days. Some waterways even reached record levels.\n\nFlood warnings were active in counties across the state, including Pasco, Hernando, Hillsborough, Citrus, Levy, DeSoto, Alachua, Volusia and Seminole, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIn the Tampa Bay area, Cypress Creek was measured at 15 feet Sunday, snapping the previous flood record of 13.8 feet set in 2004, according to the weather service.\n\nThe Hillsborough River at a state park northeast of Tampa also hit record heights on Sunday, reaching 15.9 feet, well above the previous highest crest of 14.7 feet, set in 1960. The flooding submerged roads in the Crystal Springs neighborhood, trapping residents in their homes.\n\nIn Seminole County, just north of Orlando, officials urged people to stay aware of the rising Saint Johns River.\n\n\"Levels have reached major flood stage, with a rise to near record flood possible in another week or two,\" the weather service in Melbourne said, adding that residents in Volusia and Seminole counties \"should be prepared for prolonged major flood impacts for the next several weeks.\"\n\nWhat does climate change mean to you?Here's what different generations say.\n\nAfter torrential rains, here come cold nights\n\nMany Florida residents trying to recover from Helene and Milton's wet and windy one-two punch will have to contend with another variable from Mother Nature this week: An approaching cold front that could bring unseasonably low temperatures, especially overnight, across much of the state.\n\nFlorida's average October temperatures range from the low 70s in the northern parts to the low 80s down south. Daytime temperatures won't vary too much from the norm, but beginning Tuesday night Tallahassee will dip into the 40s at night and Jacksonville into the 50s. As the cold front makes its way south later in the week, the Orlando region will also get into the nighttime 50s, while the Tampa Bay area in the hard-hit west coast will drop to around 60 degrees.\n\nThe cold front is expected to come with dry conditions, which should help flooded communities. And there are no tropical cyclones in the Atlantic at this point, though forecasters are keeping tabs on a disturbance west of the Cabo Verde Islands that has a 40% chance of developing into a tropical depression in the next week, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nSt. Pete Beach residents encouraged by Biden visit\n\nPart-time St. Pete Beach resident Paul Giardina was happy to see the president in town, saying he hopes it speeds up recovery efforts. Giardina lives in a one-story condo building with seven units near where Biden spoke in front of a collapsed house. His property was spared significant damage from both Helene and Milton.\n\nHelene sent about half an inch of water into the building, ruining a bed, rugs, and other items, Giardina said. Milton tore off some roof shingles. But Giardina is grateful the storms didn’t do more damage, noting a house behind him lost the roof, and a condo building next door had more than three feet of water.\n\n\"We were the lucky ones,\" he said.\n\nCathie Perkins, the emergency management director of Pinellas County, which encompasses St. Pete Beach, said about half of the county was still without electricity Sunday. The community is tired and frustrated, Perkins said, adding it’s encouraging to know more help is on the way.\n\n“We’re just very grateful that both the state and federal governments are here to help us and provide us with resources,” Perkins said. “I think it means a lot to people to see that we’re not alone.”\n\nRiver flooding after Milton traps residents in their homes\n\nResidents in a New Port Richey neighborhood have been trapped in their homes for days as floodwaters from the Anclote River rose to deadly heights, leaving numerous roads impassable.\n\nThe flooding, which reached 3 feet in some areas, trapped two elderly people in a car as they turned onto a neighborhood road and drove into a pond that submerged their Toyota Corolla, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. While the 82-year-old man survived, the 88-year-old woman in the passenger seat was pronounced dead.\n\nNeighbors said they were shocked by the incident, and it convinced many to wait out the flooding instead of trying to wade through. Most homes in the neighborhood still had power.\n\n\"We're all getting a little stir crazy,\" said Emily Archer, a resident who has been delivering aid to residents using her lifted Jeep.

Nichol Fountaine says she has PTSD from all the water in her home, with every storm bringing a wave of anxiety.\n\nThe storm surge from Hurricane Helene last month was the most devastating, pushing 3 feet of water into the Fountaine’s three-bedroom 1960s home. Hurricane Milton just added to the misery when it made landfall on Siesta Key on Wednesday and delivered 2 feet of storm surge into the Fountaines' house.\n\n“I’m done,” Nichol said. “I love it, I’ll visit it, but I don’t want to live it anymore.” Read more here.\n\nSarasota-Bradenton airport to reopen Wednesday after $10M in damage\n\nSarasota-Bradenton International Airport will remain closed until at least Wednesday after Milton’s winds damaged two sections of roof located over the main concourse, an official said.\n\nAirport CEO Rick Piccolo told the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, part of the USA TODAY Network, that repairs are underway and the airport expects to open at 9 a.m. Wednesday for passenger flights.\n\nPrivate aviation with small aircraft are already able to use the airport's airfield. The airport parking lots and access for car rental purposes remain open.\n\n\"I think we have at least $10 million worth of damage, if not more,\" Piccolo said. \"We have debris, pieces of roof that blew off and a lot of hangars that have been either heavily damaged or destroyed.”\n\n– Samantha Gholar and Jesse Mendoza,Sarasota Herald-Tribune\n\nHurricane Milton's hit:How will it affect our insurance premiums in Florida?\n\nHow much will Milton's damage cost?\n\nEarly estimates suggest the damage caused by Hurricane Milton could total $50 billion, Biden said Friday. But the total cost from property damage and economic loss caused could exceed $160 billion, according to an estimate from AccuWeather, which considers impacts such as long-term health care costs to survivors and disruption to business and industries.\n\n\"Milton will go down as one of the most damaging and impactful storms in Florida history, along with Hurricane Helene’s estimated total damage and economic loss of $225-250 billion just two weeks ago,\" AccuWeather said.\n\nSince 1980, hurricanes have caused more than $1.3 trillion in damages, with each event on average bringing a cost of about $22.8 billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office for Coastal Management.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nContributing: Laurie K.

Ahead of time, he caught up with residents in the community to gauge what was on their minds.\n\nPart-time St Pete Beach resident Paul Giardina was happy to see the president in town, saying he hopes it speeds recovery efforts.\n\nGiardina lives in one-story condo building with seven units near where Biden planned to speak in front of a collapsed house. His property was spared significant damage from both Helene and Milton.\n\nHelene sent about half an inch of water into the building, ruining a bed, rugs and other items. Milton tore off some roof shingles. But Giardina is grateful the storms didn’t do more damage, noting a house behind him lost the roof and a condo building next door had more than three feet of water.\n\n“We were the lucky ones,” he said.\n\n“We’re just very grateful that both the state and federal governments are here to help us and provide us with resources,” emergency management director Cathi Perkins added. “I think it means a lot to people to see that we’re not alone.”\n\nRead Anderson's full report here.\n\nWheels down in Tampa for Air Force One; aerial damage tour begins\n\nAir Force One landed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa at 9:44 a.m. \"after an uneventful flight where MSNBC was on the TVs and the press cabin received no visitors,\" wrote Washington Post pool reporter Matt Viser.\n\n\"After taxing for several minutes, POTUS emerged at 9:58am to greet several officials awaiting him, hugging and shaking hands.

One big question is whether the state's Gov. Ron DeSantis will meet with the president during his visit.\n\nDeSantis held a press conference in south Florida during the president's Oct. 3 visit, and the two did not meet.\n\nDeSantis has been a leading critic of the federal disaster response on Hurricane Helene, telling FOX News that \"in Florida, we run the show.\"\n\n\"You are not going to see FEMA running amuck in Florida,\" he said Wednesday. \"I'm the sheriff that's in charge here and we will make sure to protect you. Don't worry about it.\"\n\nHowever, he has also taken a softer tone with Milton, saying that “everything that we’ve asked for the administration has approved.\"\n\nBiden also had praise for the Florida governor when asked at the White House if he would be meeting with the governor. He called him \"cooperative\" and said \"we got on very, very well\" in a phone call\n\n\"The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he’s gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said – no – you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,\" Biden said at a press conference from the White House ahead of Milton's catastrophic landfall Tuesday. \"There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor – from Florida to North Carolina – has been fully cooperative and supportive.\"\n\nWhat's the itinerary for President Biden's visit\n\n\"A good early Sunday morning from the White House, where the sun has started to rise and the motorcade started to roll,\" wrote Washington Post pool reporter Matt Viser at 7:30 a.m.\n\nThe president has left the White House and is headed to Florida by way of Joint Base Andrews, his itinerary for the visit states.

After landing at Perry airport, a motorcade took him to Keaton Beach, which bore the brunt of Helene's storm surge.\n\nBiden, who donned a baseball cap and aviator sunglasses, spent time speaking with Taylor County's first responders, including Sheriff Wayne Padgett.\n\n“He was very nice, he shook all of our hands,” Morgan said.\n\nBiden even sang “Happy Birthday” to one of the first responders.\n\n“He was very supportive of what we have going on,” Morgan added.\n\nThe entire visit to Taylor County took no longer than two hours.\n\nWhat Biden will see in St. Pete Beach\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK journalists Alicia Devine and Elena Barrera were in St. Pete Beach on Friday afternoon.

The first would have been two days after the July 13 assassination attempt of 2024 Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump. The second was shelved after Biden came down with COVID-19.\n\nLivestream:President Biden to speak at LBJ Library in Austin on Monday: How to watch\n\nSince the plan to come to Texas was announced earlier this month, the political landscape has shifted dramatically. Biden, under increasing pressure from high-profile figures within his party, ended his bid for a second term July 21 even though he had the pledged delegates to the Democratic National Convention to easily win renomination.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, bolstered by Biden's swift endorsement, appears to be on a glide path to that nomination.\n\nAustin Mayor Kirk Watson greeted Biden at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport around 2:30 p.m. and the program at LBJ Library began around 3 p.m.\n\nThis live blog contains updates from the day of the event.

Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, who earlier this month made the first inter-party call for Biden to forgo reelection and letting someone else seek the Democratic nomination for president. Others on the tarmac included Travis County Judge Andy Brown, Austin Mayor Kirk Watson and Texas House Democratic leader Trey Martinez Fischer.\n\n-Hogan Gore\n\n2:48 p.m. update: Biden lands in Austin to commemorate Civil Rights Act\n\nPresident Joe Biden, traveling aboard Air Force One, landed at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport at 2:48 p.m. Monday to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act during a ceremony at the LBJ Presidential Library.\n\n-Hogan Gore\n\n2:40 p.m. update: Onlookers begin gathering for Biden's Austin visit\n\nValeria Guillen, a member of the UT community, arrived by the shaded benches at the hill above the LBJ fountain on campus at 10 a.m. Monday in hopes of catching the president's eye during his visit to the LBJ Presidential Library to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nSince then, she’s been carrying a sign with a photo of Vanessa Guillen, a United States Army Soldier who was brutally killed and sexually harassed at Fort Hood north of Austin, that read “We want true accountability.” Guillen, Vanessa's mom's cousin, told the Statesman she hoped President Joe Biden would see her sign when he looks toward the fountain and remembers Vanessa Guillen, who’s death sparked a wave of calls and action to address sexual harassment and assault in the military. “We don’t want this to be forgotten,” she said.Guillen plans to be by the library until 4 p.m. She said she hopes Biden speaks up about sexual harassment in the military to help bring true justice to Vanessa’s mother and sisters, who she said do not have support from the government or military. Guillen also said she hopes there is more awareness of resources people can turn to.\n\nAround 2 p.m., Esala Wueschner, a Travis County Republican Party precinct chair, gazed toward the LBJ Presidential Library's entrance from the hill across the way, with a carabiner pining a blue Trump flag like a cape across his cherry red Trump shirt.“There’s a lot of people here in Austin, even Democrats, who don’t support Biden,” Wueschner said. “I’m here to give them courage to stand up for their personal values.”About an hour before the commemoration ceremony was expected to start, several spectators had begun to gather on the hill. Police set up a wide perimeter around the venue, blocking off the parking lot and Robert Dedman Drive from DKR stadium to Trinity Street. Wueschner said he is supporting Trump not because he thinks he’s a good person, but because he has faith in the Republican Party and its policies. He said he wants to encourage others to stand up for their beliefs when it comes to picking a candidate, regardless of which party they are registered with.\n\n-Lily Kepner\n\n2:15 p.m. update: Biden's motorcade arrives at Austin airport\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s motorcade has arrived at Austin Bergstrom-International Airport.The president’s limousine, an army of black SUVs, several shuttle buses, equipment trucks and an ambulance are awaiting his arrival from Washington on the tarmac.

Lloyd Doggett, the Austin Democrat who first called on Biden to end his reelection bid, has received an invitation to Monday's speech at the LBJ Presidential Library, the congressman's office said.\n\nDoggett's call earlier this month launched what turned out to be a national conversation over whether Biden could beat Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 election and whether he had the stamina and acuity to mount an effective campaign. After weeks of resisting calls to step aside, Biden reversed course July 21 and ended his campaign. He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination.\n\n-John Moritz\n\n9:30 a.m. update: Expect travel delays as President Biden visits Austin\n\nTravelers can expect delays of 15-30 minutes as Biden arrives in Austin on Monday afternoon, Austin Bergstrom-International Airport advised passengers Sunday.\n\nWith Biden's arrival expected around 2:30 p.m., the president's motorcade will head through downtown Austin en route to the LBJ Presidential Library at UT.\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation also warned drivers to seek alternate routes through Austin on Monday between 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. as there will be \"rolling closures on major roadways,\" including Interstate 35 and Texas 71, during Biden's visit.\n\nUpon his departure from Austin on Air Force One, Biden will fly to Houston to pay respects to the late Sheila Jackson Lee. The Houston Democrat, who served in Congress for 30 years, passed away July 19 at age 74 and is lying in state this week at Houston City Hall.\n\n-Hogan Gore\n\n9 a.m. update: Biden to call for reforms to U.S. Supreme Court, limits to presidential immunity in speech\n\nBiden will voice support for sweeping changes to the U.S. Supreme Court and limits on presidential power during his speech at Austin's LBJ Presidential Library and Museum on Monday afternoon, USA Today, the Washington Post and the AP report.\n\nVice president and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris also supports the proposals Biden will announce, the White House wrote in a fact sheet.\n\nThe president is calling for a constitutional amendment that would \"make clear that there is no immunity for crimes committed while in office,\" he detailed in a Washington Post op-ed published Monday morning. The amendment would nullify the high court's recent ruling that former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is immune from criminal prosecution for acts taken in his official capacity, making it a long shot to clear the two-thirds majority it needs in both the Senate and the GOP-dominated House.\n\nBiden is also seeking term limits and an enforceable code of ethics for Supreme Court justices, noting the U.S. is \"the only major constitutional democracy that gives lifetime seats to its high court.\" Both reforms would need to be confirmed by Congress, an unlikely prospect while the House maintains a GOP majority. The Senate has only 51 Democrats but needs 60 votes to pass most measures.\n\nThe binding code of conduct Biden seeks would require justices to \"disclose gifts, refrain from public political activity and recuse themselves from cases in which they or their spouses have financial or other conflicts of interest,\" replacing a system of self-enforcement.\n\n\"This is common sense,\" the president wrote Monday. \"Every other federal judge is bound by an enforceable code of conduct, and there is no reason for the Supreme Court to be exempt.\"\n\nThe call comes as Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito have faced criticism over reports that Thomas accepted free travel from well-connected billionaires and Alito's wife flew politically-charged flags.\n\n\"What is happening now is not normal, and it undermines the public’s confidence in the court’s decisions, including those impacting personal freedoms,\" Biden wrote. \"We now stand in a breach.\"\n\n-Bayliss Wagner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/01/joe-biden-campaign-visit-to-michigan/72436890007/", "title": "Biden makes first Michigan visit for 2024 campaign", "text": "President Joe Biden made his first Michigan campaign stop of the year on Thursday, with a quick multistop tour through metro Detroit that included a brief speech at a UAW training hall in Warren where he praised the union workers as \"the best in the world\" and said their efforts have improved conditions for workers across the economy.\n\n\"When labor does well, everybody does well,\" Biden told the audience in a 7½-minute speech at the Region 1 George Merrelli Technical Training Center, where he received a standing ovation from workers.\n\nThe visit — Biden's first to Michigan since walking a picket line in Belleville in September as the UAW struck General Motors, Ford and Stellantis in an unprecedented move for a sitting president — came as the president is ramping up his reelection campaign even in the face of lagging poll and job approval numbers, including in Michigan, a key swing state he most likely will need to win to remain in the White House. But there are signs the coalition in Michigan that helped Biden win in 2020 has fractured in response to his unequivocal support for Israel in its war in Gaza.\n\nWith workers chanting, \"Joe, Joe, Joe,\" Biden celebrated economic gains made during his presidency, including continued low unemployment and strong hiring rates and wage gains following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"We now have in large part because of you and organized labor, the strongest economy in the whole damn world,” he said. “Inflation’s coming down. Jobs are growing.”\n\nHe also said a manufacturing renaissance is underway, commenting, “Remember they told us ‘manufacturing’s dead in America. China’s going to eat our lunch?’ Well, guess what man, we don’t taste that good.”\n\nHe told UAW workers \"the whole country owes you.\"\n\nBiden's visit to the battleground state came a week after the UAW endorsed him after initially withholding its support, even though most other major unions had already voiced support for the president. Even after Biden, a self-professed \"car guy\" and longtime supporter of unions including the UAW, walked the picket line in support of the union's effort to get better wages, benefits and job security out of the Detroit Three automakers, the union's brass withheld its endorsement, saying it needed to be earned.\n\nThat endorsement came last week, with a clearly pleased Biden accepting it at a speech in Washington, saying, \"The days of working people being dealt out of deals in this country are over as long as I am president.\"\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain — who previously gave a rousing speech endorsing Biden as a friend of the working class and slamming his likely opponent in this year's election, former President Donald Trump, as a member of the \"billionaire class\" and a \"scab\" — introduced Biden at the Region 1 training center hall on Thursday, saying the union's main goal is to keep the pro-labor president in office.\n\n\"It's a very clear choice in this election,\" Fain said. \"We're going to fight like hell.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, Fain's full-throated endorsement of Biden led to social media insults from Trump, who called him a \"dope\" and \"a weapon of mass destruction\" for the auto industry and called on union members to get rid of him. But Fain battled back on cable shows and elsewhere, citing what he characterized as Trump's lagging record in aiding workers' rights.\n\nOn the heels of the UAW's successful strike against the Detroit Three, the union leader — who is no stranger to being verbally aggressive when the situation calls for it — could prove to be an important ally for the Biden campaign in the industrial Midwest.\n\nOn Thursday, Biden greeted the crowd receiving a standing ovation. \"Supporting you is the easiest thing I've ever done,\" he said. Calling them \"the best workers in the world,\" he reiterated in his brief speech that unions built the middle class and noted that the UAW's strike resulted not only in their wages and benefits getting better but nonunion automakers improving worker conditions, too.\n\nBefore Biden met with UAW members, many in the union hall were making phone calls on Biden's behalf ahead of Michigan's Feb. 27 Democratic primary. One wall featured union posters spelling \"UAW” with red and blue signs beneath that read \"4 Joe” and substituted the “o” in “Joe” with the union’s logo. Several elected officials were on hand, including Michigan state House Speaker Joe Tate, D-Detroit, Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter and Warren Mayor Lori Stone.\n\nAhead of the UAW stop, Biden landed in Michigan at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township, being met by Fain, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Macomb County Executive Mark Hackel and others. U.S Sens. Gary Peters and Debbie Stabenow, both D-Mich., accompanied him on Air Force One, as did U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, a longtime friend of Biden's and his wife, first lady Jill Biden.\n\nAfter that, Biden stopped at a Black-owned Harper Woods eatery They Say, greeting diners and taking selfies.\n\n\"We need a man like Joe Biden. We need a man that will stand his ground and make sure that we are still America,” said Thurston Rogers, 80, of Detroit, who is a frequent diner at the restaurant and was surprised to see the president show up Thursday afternoon. Rogers plans to support Biden this year.Biden made a third stop after the UAW hall at the Simple Palate restaurant in Warren, where he was expected to have what his campaign characterized as a \"kitchen table\" conversation with local autoworkers, including one of the UAW members with whom the president walked the picket line in Belleville and three members of a family — a woman and her two adult children — who are all UAW members.\n\nFacing criticism on war, other policies\n\nBut Biden's visit wasn't without its critics. Pro-Palestinian protestors furious that the Biden administration hasn't done more to demand that Israel call a cease-fire to its attacks on the Gaza Strip following Hamas' attacks on Israel in October, gathered not far from the UAW hall. A heavy police presence amassed as protesters shouted chants like \"Biden Biden can't you see/you are on a killing spree\" and \"shame on you.\"\n\nSome Arab American Democrats recently turned down a meeting with Biden’s campaign, including Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who said he remained open to meeting with members of Biden’s administration. \"From our perspective, we don't like to categorize this issue strictly as it pertains to the upcoming elections, because it dehumanizes us,\" he said during an interview on PBS NewsHour earlier this week.\n\nHammoud did not call on his constituents to withhold their votes for Biden this fall, but other Arab Americans in Michigan have. The eve before Biden’s visit, protesters held \"abandon Biden\" signs during a rally in Dearborn. \"We are not interested in conversations with this campaign and this administration,\" Dearborn attorney Amer Zahr told the crowd.\n\nBiden, however, is still expected to try to take steps to quell strong feelings against his administration among southeast Michigan's large Arab American and Muslim community centered on Dearborn because of its support of Israel in attacking Gaza.\n\nIn response to criticism from Arab Americans in Michigan regarding Biden's stance, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated the president's position that Israel has a right to defend itself within the bounds of international law during a news media briefing Wednesday. “At the same time, he is heartbroken. Heartbroken by the suffering of innocent Palestinians … who have been caught in the middle of this conflict sadly obviously between Israel and Hamas,\" she said.\n\nTalking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday ahead of Biden's campaign visit, Jean-Pierre said that senior administration officials will be visiting Michigan in the days and weeks to come ahead of the state's Feb. 27 primary, \"to hear directly from community leaders on a range of issues that are important to them and their families, including the conflict in Israel and Gaza.\"\n\nIn a move supported by Fain, the UAW has joined calls for a cease-fire, though it didn't come up in the meeting Thursday or during last week's endorsement. Meanwhile, Biden made news just before leaving Washington for Thursday's trip to Michigan, signing an executive order to sanction Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank who have \"perpetrated violence\" and otherwise intimidated Palestinians there. It comes after a 17-year-old American was killed while learning about his heritage in the West Bank last month.\n\nDespite recent moves by the administration to urge Israel to scale back operations in Gaza, many Arab Americans and Muslim families in Michigan's large community remain furious that Biden and his allies aren't doing more to stop the war and save innocent families with some 27,000 Palestinians killed in four months.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, a former Michigan GOP chair, issued a statement saying Biden has \"empowered China, outsourced jobs and played politics at the expense of union workers in Michigan and across the country.\" She also criticized not-yet-finalized rules for cars and trucks that, if implemented as originally proposed, could put far greater pressure on automakers to sell electric vehicles whether that's what the buyers want or not.\n\nU.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Caledonia, also said Biden's policies have led to higher inflation, though that rate has begun to come down. \"President Biden can try to sell ‘Bidenomics’ but Michigan families are not buying it because it’s too expensive,” he said.\n\nFree Press staff writers Niraj Warikoo and Christina Hall contributed to this report.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

The efforts will be funded by $2.6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nHe also announced a final U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule requiring that drinking water systems replace the lead pipes that connect water mains in the street to properties, known as service lines, by 2037.\n\nLead drinking water pipes should have been addressed long ago, he told a supportive and vocal crowd.\n\n\"For too long, local communities have known how important it was to deal with this problem,\" he said. \"It hadn't been given the national priority it demanded, though. I'm here today to tell you that I'm finally insisting that it gets prioritized, and I'm insisting that it get done.\"\n\nBiden, who was joined by state and local officials, noted that Black children are more likely to have elevated levels of lead in their blood than children of other racial groups, adding, \"We have an obligation to make things right.\"\n\nLead poisoning can carry lifelong consequences, particularly for young children, and there is no safe level of exposure. Sources include chipping paint and plumbing that carries drinking water.\n\nBefore the visit was announced, Milwaukee water officials and Common Council members raised concerns that heavy attention on lead pipes could provide residents a false sense of security given the serious hazards lead paint poses in the city's old housing stock.\n\nMayor Cavalier Johnson pushed back on those concerns.\n\n\"We've not taken our eye off the ball in terms of lead paint, either,\" Johnson said. \"It's important to take care of this issue around lead service laterals, yes, but it's also important to make sure that we're abating the issue of lead paint and lead in soil and the like.\"\n\nIn 2021, the city allocated $26 million in federal pandemic aid for lead paint abatement. Additional funding to address lead paint was also announced Tuesday by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, with Milwaukee County expected to receive $7.75 million of the nearly $13 million allocated to Wisconsin, according to the White House.\n\nBiden's visit to Milwaukee comes amid VP Kamala Harris campaign for the White House\n\nBiden's visit came as his Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns against former President Donald Trump for the White House. Both campaigns are crisscrossing Wisconsin, a critical swing state, ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\n\nIn July, Biden dropped his bid for re-election after a disastrous debate performance and endorsed Harris.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden accused Trump and Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a Trump ally, of being willing to leave people behind. He slammed Johnson's statement that the infrastructure bill was the first step in Democrats' \"radical\" agenda.\n\n\"I don't think there's a damn thing radical about protecting kids from lead poisoning, protecting women from low birthrates, protecting from brain damage and so much more,\" he said.\n\nAlluding to the upcoming election, Biden said, \"Folks, in plain talk, we can't go backwards. We have to keep moving forward.\"\n\nTrump campaign spokesman Jacob Fischer said Biden's visit to Milwaukee was a reminder that a Harris administration \"would be another four years of historic inflation and high prices.\"\n\nWisconsin to receive $43 million of $2.6 billion for drinking water upgrades and lead pipe replacements, White House says\n\nA $43 million cut of the $2.6 billion will be allotted to Wisconsin. The state government will then determine how much is awarded to local water systems, according to the White House.\n\nAlonso Romo, who introduced Biden at Tuesday's event, said replacing lead service lines is especially rewarding work.\n\n\"It's hard work. I mean, digging,\" Romo, 21, said as he held up his calloused hands. \"Everybody needs water.\"\n\nRomo, who is a with LiUNA Local 113, added, \"I'm helping get clean water to drink.\"\n\nThe White House on Tuesday also announced efforts to expand workforce development programs to ensure everyone — including women, people of color, and veterans — have access to job opportunities. For example, the City of Milwaukee will run a pilot program from 2025 to 2027 through its Department of Public Works and Milwaukee Water Works requiring that 10% of labor hours go to apprentices. Half of those apprentices will be city residents who are currently underrepresented in those fields, officials said.\n\nIn a statement, Clean Wisconsin's Water and Agriculture Program Director Sara Walling applauded the federal requirement to remove lead pipes.\n\n\"As we confront the legacy of lead contamination, this rule strengthens accountability and prioritizes the safety of our most vulnerable communities,\" Walling said. \"Today's announcement sets us on a course for a healthier future, empowering local governments and water utilities to address this persistent threat with greater urgency and transparency.\"\n\nCity of Milwaukee to replace as many as 2,400 lead service lines in 2024, Water Works superintendent says\n\nThe City of Milwaukee has about 65,000 residential lead service lines yet to replace, according to the Milwaukee Water Works website.\n\nSince Jan. 1, 2017, the city has replaced more than 8,000 lead pipes, Water Works Superintendent Patrick Pauly told the council's Public Works Committee last week.\n\nAs many as 2,400 lead pipes will be replaced in Milwaukee this year — more than the 2,200 replacements budgeted, Pauly said.\n\nA year ago, the city received $30 million for lead service line replacement, and Pauly said the city has applied for $34.2 million for 2025. He expected that award would be announced early this month.\n\nThe water utility is looking to replace 3,500 lead service lines in 2025. It will need to increase the number of replacements annually in 2026 and 2027 in order to meet the 2037 deadline to complete all replacements, he said.\n\nCost to replace Milwaukee's remaining lead pipes could be $700 million\n\nOn Tuesday, Pauly told reporters it would cost about $700 million to remove the city's remaining lead pipes over the coming 13 years.\n\nHe called the funding \"an incredible benefit\" to the city and said the utility would be applying for dollars annually through the state Department of Natural Resources' Safe Drinking Water Loan Program. The bill funding was anticipated to last for five years, though he said the utility's understanding is that it will last longer, he said.\n\nHowever, while Pauly said the utility would increase its number of replacements in the coming years he also offered a warning.\n\n\"I cannot stress enough that more funding will need to be found,\" he said. \"We're hopeful for additional funding when the results of this initial bill funding package are seen and the progress it's made and the positive results here. Otherwise, those costs are going to fall to utility ratepayers and the property tax base.\"\n\nMilwaukee water officials, council members raise concerns about lead paint\n\nAt last week's committee meeting, questions were raised about the resources going to lead pipes and the attention on that source of lead over other sources like paint.\n\nHistorical data show that even in buildings with lead service lines, the water utility's corrosion control treatment is \"very effective,\" Water Works Water Quality Manager Michelle Natarajan said.\n\n\"The problem with lead is that it is variable, and so any time there is lead plumbing or a lead service line, there is some amount of risk,\" she told the committee. \"So, it's not bad to remove them, but it is a lot of resources being spent on an area where we're not seeing overall elevated lead in the water.\"\n\nAld. Robert Bauman said replacing lead pipes has \"now become almost an article of faith nationally, ... yet the actual data does not suggest it's that big a problem.\"\n\nPauly said the challenges of abating lead in paint and soil are significantly larger than replacing a lead service line, which he said could be done in four hours. The focus, he said, has in some ways shifted to water and lead service lines because it's a simpler process to address.\n\nHe raised concerns that this could provide residents with a false sense of security.\n\n\"We struggle, as I believe the Health Department does, with the focus falling to water, which is really a disservice to the community if we are not emphasizing the risks from the other contributors,\" Pauly told the committee. \"If there is a belief that it's the water and you get the lead service line replaced and you're safe, that's a disservice.\"\n\nA Journal Sentinel analysis of state Department of Health Services data last year showed that the highest childhood lead exposure rates in Milwaukee were concentrated in census tracts that were predominantly Black and had older housing stock and a higher rate of building code violations — a proxy for substandard housing where chipping lead paint is a particular danger for children.\n\nThese factors were more strongly linked to childhood lead poisoning rates than other variables, like the presence of lead service lines. Although lead pipes are a known cause of childhood lead exposure, they are present in most parts of the city regardless of demographics and income levels.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin announced that Milwaukee County would receive $7.75 million and Kenosha County would receive nearly $5.2 million to remove lead paint from homes. The funding is from the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction grant program, according to Baldwin's office.\n\nBiden addresses PFAS in Milwaukee remarks\n\nBiden also addressed PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, in his remarks.\n\nWisconsin has been battling PFAS in drinking water for years and was one of the few states that enacted regulations before the federal government introduced formal legislation earlier this year.\n\n\"These are chemicals found in many everyday products but are unsafe and shown to contribute to cancer and other health conditions,\" Biden said. \"We set the first ever drinking water standard to protect 100 million Americans from PFAS, including folks all across Wisconsin.\"\n\nAs a part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act, Wisconsin communities will receive millions of dollars to help pay for new water filtration systems to remove PFAS and prevent them from being delivered by municipal systems into homes in impacted communities.\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\n\nAlison Dirr can be reached at adirr@jrn.com.

He said his government had a special focus on helping disadvantaged and low-income communities that have often been overlooked.\n\n“Folks this is about safety, but it’s also about fairness,” he said. “We have to make things right, and we’re going to do that now.”\n\nWithout mentioning Donald Trump by name, referring to him as his “predecessor” several times, Biden said his administration was making progress for all Americans – not just the wealthy and corporations.\n\n“I’m sick and tired of trickle-down economics,” he said to loud applause.\n\nAlong with brandishing his environmental credentials, Biden mentioned his work in helping the economy – especially manufacturing – bounce back from the pandemic and foreign competition.\n\nHe took special note of his administration's work on reducing medical and prescription costs, something he said he had been working on for decades while in the U.S. Senate.\n\n“I know I look like I’m only 40, but I’m a little older than that,” Biden said, taking a self-deprecating jab at the age issue that has dogged him during his re-election push.\n\nThe president wrapped up his comments just after 5:22 p.m.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nShow the president 'our Wilmington'\n\nWilmington Mayor Bill Saffo took the stage at 4:40 p.m., warming up the crowd.\n\nHe talked up the sense of community and how peoplepower can make a difference in good governance and protecting the environment.\n\nSaffo was followed by EPA Administrator Michael Regan, who used to be the head of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality.\n\n“It is great to be home back in North Carolina,” Regan said, before mentioning the new PFAS regulations he had announced in Fayetteville last month.\n\nHe then said President Biden is keeping his promises and working “every single day” for a healthier and fairer America.\n\nRegan also praised Saffo and local advocates for staring down the water quality issues the Cape Fear region had been facing for years.\n\nThat journey would be continued today by the president’s announcement to dedicate billions toward the removal of lead pipes from the nation’s water systems.\n\nNext up was Gov. Roy Cooper, who received the first standing ovation of the afternoon.\n\n“I’m excited and always excited to be at the beach,” he said after remarking that this was the president’s third visit in four months to North Carolina.\n\n“And with him being from Delaware, we want to show him our Wilmington,\" he said to thunderous applause. \"If Air Force One's crew ever gets confused about which Wilmington to fly to, tell them to head south!\"\n\nNext up is President Biden, who started his remarks remembering the law enforcement officers' lives lost in Charlotte on Monday.\n\nAfterwards, Biden noted to Saffo that there's another Wilmington: The one the President knows well in Delaware.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nBiden reaches Wilmington Convention Center\n\nPresident Joe Biden arrived at Wilmington International Airport’s Aero Center and was greeted by Wilmington Mayor Bill Saffo and Governor Roy Cooper at 4:20 p.m.\n\nSaffo joined the motorcade and they departed to travel to the Wilmington Convention Center where Biden is expected to deliver his remarks. Around 20 minutes later, the motorcade arrived.\n\nRemarks will include environmental investments such as the replacement of 1.7 million toxic lead pipes throughout the U.S.\n\nBiden will also meet with local students and faculty from a Wilmington school that was able to replace a water fountain with high levels of lead with funding from the president’s American Rescue Plan.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nBiden arrives...and so do Donald Trump supporters\n\nAir Force One made its way to Wilmington International Airport around 4:15 p.m.\n\nWhile it might be around 5 p.m. before President Joe Biden arrives at the Wilmington Convention Center, a few supporters of former President Donald Trump will also be there to greet him.\n\nBy 3:30 p.m., dozens of civilians gathered about a block away from the convention center. Among them were about 40 pro-Palestinian activists and roughly the same number of supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump’s supporters raised flags with “Trump 2024” and “Women for Trump” messages, among others.The crowd of activists held signs and yelled “Free, free, free Palestine,” “Cease fire now,” “Biden, Biden, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide,” among other chants.\n\n-- Jamey Cross\n\nDistrict Attorney on Biden: 'He's putting his money where his mouth is'\n\nNew Hanover and Pender County District Attorney Ben David said Wilmington \"will always be a place where the biggest races are decided\" as he awaited President Joe Biden's arrival at the Wilmington Convention Center Thursday afternoon. \"Politically we are a microcosm, we represent what America looks like and we are confronting some of the biggest issues honestly here, and so, it's only appropriate that (Biden) should come to Wilmington.\"\n\nPrior to his arrival in Wilmington, Biden is making a stop in Charlotte to meet with the families of law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty.\n\nDavid said he appreciates that the president \"recognizes the importance of going to a tragedy like that and calling out the violence that has to stop.\" Addressing such violence is important, \"particularly when it's directed at people who are just trying to do their jobs,\" David added.\n\nThe district attorney said he admires that the president has come to North Carolina to address three important topics: honoring men and women in law enforcement, the environment, and infrastructure.\n\n\"He's putting his money where his mouth is,\" David said about Biden.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nWhite House remarks before flight to Wilmington\n\nPress Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration mourns “for the fallen heroes and their loved ones and (prays) for the recoveries of the courageous officers who were wounded” while en route to Charlotte, according to a press release.\n\nJean-Pierre also touched on the upcoming presidential visit to Wilmington. While the schedule noted Joe Biden's arrival to the Wilmington International Airport around 3:55 p.m., it's more likely Air Force One will arrive at 4:15 p.m.\n\n“President Biden believes that every American should be able to turn on the tap and...drink clean and safe water,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\nEnviornmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said he was “really excited to join the president today for this big announcement.”\n\n“This is the third installment of five,” Regan said in the release. “We are giving out or investing into grants that will amount to $15 billion in total. This is the third year, so the President has already put out $9 billion to erase these lead service lines in our country.”\n\nThe 100% removal of lead piping across the country is expected to complete within a 10-year window, Regan said in the release, adding that he was unable to provide an estimate on the percentage of lead piping that has already been removed nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nSeats all spoken for\n\nThe first attendees at President Joe Biden’s event at the Wilmington Convention Center began filing in just after 2 p.m.\n\nTwenty minutes later, the small guest area was roughly half full of VIPs, hand-picked by the White House and local Democratic Party for the president’s announcement about new funding to remove lead pipes from homes and public water systems.\n\nWith the president not scheduled to speak for around two hours, many of the attendees took the downtime to excitedly take pictures in front of the dais and lectern that would later be occupied by the country’s top executive – large signs and digital boards behind them advertising Biden’s impending policy announcement.\n\nBy 2:35 p.m., officials announced all the seats were taken and it would now be standing-room only as people continued to file in.\n\n-- Gareth McGrath\n\nWomen's groups arrive at convention center\n\nElli Klein, founding administrator of Southeast North Carolina Women for Biden/Harris, arrived at the Wilmington Convention Center around 2:15 p.m. on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm joining my Democratic Party colleagues to hear what the president has to say and all that he is doing (and) all the administration is doing to improve our infrastructure,\" said Klein less than two hours before President Joe Biden is scheduled to give remarks. \"It's exciting. We have a lot of work to do to make sure we preserve our reproductive freedom and our democracy.\"\n\nElaine Syres, core member of Women Organizing for Wilmington (WOW), arrived at the Wilmington Convention Center sporting both a WOW T-shirt and a blue American Federation of Teachers T-shirt.\n\nSyres recalled Women Organizing for Wilmington protests held outside on the corner of City Hall in 2016.\n\n\"The first one I was involved in was (about) the condition of the water in New Hanover County and the PFAS and everything else,\" Syres said. \"What good does it do everybody if the water (that is) going to the homes or schools (is) going through lead pipes? It's an issue...it could be the cleanest water in the world but if you're running it through a lead pipe, that's not helping anyone.\"\n\nBiden \"should come here\" to discuss the replacement of lead pipes, Syres said, adding it's an issue experienced nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nWilmington International Airport to soon see Air Force One\n\nBy early afternoon, President Joe Biden’s expected arrival time at Wilmington International Airport’s Aero Center remains 3:55 p.m.\n\nAbout two hours before Biden’s expected arrival, Wilmington International Airport appears not too busy. Some New Hanover County Sheriff’s Office vehicles and Wilmington Police Department vehicles are in the area.\n\nAccording to the airport’s website, flights for General Aviation users will be restricted between 1:30 p.m.-5:15 p.m.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nBy noon, Wilmington Convention Center relatively quiet\n\nAside from a heavy police presence in the area, things were largely quiet at the Wilmington Convention Center early Thursday afternoon. Several Wilmington Police Department vehicles were in the area, and deputies with the New Hanover County Sheriff's Office were also nearby.\n\nStudents made their way around Cape Fear Community College’s downtown campus Thursday afternoon, where classes were seemingly being held as usual.\n\n-- Jamey Cross\n\nMore on Biden's speech, including a visit with Wilmington students\n\nThe White House released more details about President Joe Biden's expected remarks in Wilmington on Thursday afternoon. He is scheduled to speak at the Wilmington Convention Center at 4:30 p.m.\n\nAccording to a morning news release, Biden is expected to announce a $3 billion investment to replace toxic lead pipes during his Wilmington presidential visit. Biden’s announcement “delivers funding to every state and U.S. territory to help address lead in drinking water while creating good-paying jobs,” the release reads. It added $76 million in funding from the president’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will be allocated to lead pipe replacement across North Carolina.\n\nBiden is expected to meet with faculty and students from a Wilmington school that replaced a water fountain with high levels of lead with funding from the president’s American Rescue Plan, according to the release. The total project will replace up to 1.7 million lead pipes nationwide.\n\n-- Molly Wilhelm\n\nBiden heads to Charlotte, then Wilmington\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be visiting Wilmington today to talk about address environmental issues and infrastructure in the city and surrounding region.\n\nAfter departing Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Air Force One around 11:45 a.m., his first stop will be in Charlotte to pay respects and meet family members of four law enforcement officers who died on Monday in a shootout.\n\nBiden will leave Charlotte at 3:10 p.m. and should arrive at Wilmington International Airport around 3:55. Then he will head to the Wilmington Convention Center, where he will discuss his Investing in America agenda and how it is rebuilding infrastructure and creating jobs in Wilmington and across the country, according to an email announcement from the White House.\n\nBiden in Wilmington:From arrival to traffic, here's more about the president's visit\n\nAlthough Biden is seeking reelection in November, his visit is not a campaign visit, but a presidential visit.\n\n\"It cannot come at a more-critical time during a more-critical election year in a more-critical place,\" according to a statement Monday from the New Hanover County Democratic Party.\n\nBiden's visit comes nearly two weeks after Donald Trump's campaign rally in Wilmington was postponed due to severe weather. A date has not been set yet for his return.\n\nAs for the issues Biden could be addressing, it is uncertain which ones he will cover, but PFAS filtration could be one on the list as well as the need for a Cape Fear Memorial Bridge replacement.\n\n-- Madison Lipe\n\nCheck back here for updates throughout the day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/12/donald-trump-white-house-visit-biden-meeting-when/76220713007/", "title": "Trump visiting White House, meeting with Biden: What to know", "text": "Editor's note: This story was edited to include USA TODAY's updated livestream plans.\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump is visiting Washington, D.C.

Some stood along town roads surrounding the IBM campus holding signs of support for the president; others gathered to show their displeasure. And some drivers faced added hurdles navigating traffic caused by the presidential motorcade.\n\nThe IBM program includes a $20 billion investment across sites in Poughkeepsie, Yorktown and Albany, in the areas of research and development, semiconductor manufacturing, mainframe technology, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, according to the White House, which noted “good-paying manufacturing jobs” would be created.\n\nThe program is a direct product of the CHIPS and Science Act, which Biden signed in August, according to the White House.\n\nIBM Chairman and CEO Arvind Krishna did not elaborate on how the plan would work or how many jobs may be created over the next decade.\n\nBut the visit sparked excitement all the same, including among some involved in welcoming the president.\n\nArrival in Newburgh\n\nFor Matthew DeLorenzo, the high point of the day came when Air Force One touched down at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh at 11:46 a.m.\n\nThe 24-year-old Gardiner resident, a crew chief in the U.S. Air Force, placed the stops at the wheels − or chocked − Air Force One.\n\n\"It's definitely an honor to be able to do something of this caliber,\" he said. \"Everyone knows about Air Force One and this history behind it. And having the opportunity to install chocks, I know it doesn’t seem like a big accomplishment, but it was absolutely cool to be a part of this.\"\n\nFor several minutes after disembarking, Biden stood at the base of the stairs shaking hands and chatting with fellow Democratic officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and Congressmen. Multiple members of the Secret Service surrounded the group while they mingled.\n\nThe sun shone hot and bright on the tarmac, but Biden briefly removed his sunglasses as he smiled and greeted the politicians. Then, his motorcade departed for Poughkeepsie, and the subdued crew began to show their enthusiasm for the moment.\n\nSeveral young members of the Air Force and New York Air National Guard stood in front of Air Force One taking photos on their phones and enjoying being in such close proximity to one of the most recognizable planes in the country.\n\nBiden's presence also had an impact on businesses surrounding the Poughkeepsie campus.\n\nSmall business owners are hopeful about the president’s message about more jobs in the area, which they say could translate into more customers. However, for now, they are struggling to make ends meet due to rising costs and hiring pressures.\n\nSusan Horton, owner of Nothing Bundt Cakes along Route 9, opened her bakery in 2020 and has seen the cost of supplies triple in less than two years.\n\n“We need all the help we can get in the Hudson Valley, boosting the economy with more jobs, more people and the attraction to be here,” she said.\n\n‘Hope' at IBM\n\nAt IBM, many employees and officials were eagerly anticipating the president’s arrival in advance of a 2 p.m. speech.\n\nMyja Carter, a 17-year IBM employee who is now a line lead, was among the group.\n\n\"There's hope. There's a future for my generation, for my daughter's generation,\" she said.\n\nBefore his address, Biden was taken on a brief tour of the facility, in which he was shown the z16 mainframes tested and manufactured in Poughkeepsie, and a quantum computer. He also greeted some employees.\n\n“You look like you spend a lot of time in the gym,” he told one.\n\nHis roughly 20-minute speech touched not only on IBM’s history, but the importance of the CHIPS and Science Act, aims to boost domestic manufacturing of computer chips and includes roughly $52 billion in incentives for the semiconductor industry.\n\n“It’s here, it’s here at this factory and the factories of other companies across America where America’s future is literally being built,” Biden said. “It was here in Poughkeepsie where the rifles for World War I were made, where the first electric typewriters, calculators, even cough drops were made. I brought some with me. And it’s here now where the Hudson Valley could become the epicenter of the future of quantum computing, the most advanced and fastest computing ever, ever seen in the world.\"\n\nFollowing the speech, Biden and his motorcade left IBM for Hudson Valley Regional Airport in Wappinger, where he boarded Marine One and took off before 2:50 p.m.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/politics/joe-biden-uvalde-texas-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden in Uvalde, Texas: Confronting grief and calls to 'do something ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday faced the grimly familiar task of comforting families after another mass shooting, this time at an elementary school in Texas, as a broken community – and a weary nation – grappled with an endless spate of gun violence.\n\nHearing anguished calls to “do something” as he emerged from a midday Mass in Uvalde, Biden told the crowd, “We will.” But after a day of somber remembrance, it remained unclear whether or how a nation’s grief would translate to meaningful steps to prevent future massacres.\n\nBiden and first lady Jill Biden bore witness to periodic bursts of anger during their visit to Uvalde, where a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers last week. It was their second time in as many weeks mourning alongside families whose loved ones died in a mass shooting.\n\nThe Bidens’ visit came amid news from the Justice Department that it’s conducting a review of the botched law enforcement response to the Uvalde shooting, which Texas officials have described as punctuated with wrong decisions.\n\nTheir armored black limousine arrived to a makeshift memorial outside Robb Elementary School around 11:15 a.m. Central Time, pulling to a stop next to the sea of flowers, stuffed animals and photos that has grown since the day of the massacre.\n\nThe first lady carried a large bouquet of white roses to place in front of the brick Robb Elementary School sign. The Bidens, both dressed in black, stood quietly for a moment in midday sun. The President made a sign of the cross and wiped away a tear.\n\nAfter speaking with the school’s principal and local officials, Biden and the first lady walked to a row of memorial wreaths, each marking one of the slain children or teachers. They touched cardboard cutouts of each one, their photos on the front circled by white flower garlands, in quiet observation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden pay their respects at a makeshift memorial outside of Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on Sunday. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Bidens attended Mass at Sacred Heart Catholic Church, where Archbishop Gustavo García-Siller invited children from the devastated community to sit at the front.\n\n“Our response must be one of hope and healing,” he said, urging the community to “resolve to support one another with respect for our differences.” The choir sang “On Eagle’s Wings.”\n\nBiden and the first lady spent the afternoon meeting privately with family members of the victims at Uvalde County Arena, and first responders at Garner Field, before returning to their home in Delaware.\n\nAn adviser traveling with the President said he hoped “to convey empathy and understanding of what an impossibly horrible moment this is for them” and “to offer some small piece of comfort, if that is possible.”\n\nIt was a solemn task made more grueling by the serious failings of law enforcement who responded to Tuesday’s shooting in Uvalde. And it came without promise of major legislative action to prevent further carnage, though a bipartisan group of lawmakers have begun talks to identify areas of potential action.\n\nThe frustrations of an angry public could be felt at the memorial site. Some onlookers awaiting Biden began shouting when Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott arrived to accompany the President.\n\n“Please Governor Abbott, help Uvalde County,” one man was shouting. “We need change. Our children don’t deserve this.”\n\nAs Biden was departing, similar cries for help could be heard before he stepped into his vehicle.\n\nA day before his visit, Biden spoke to the agony of the parents he would be meeting Sunday.\n\n“I’ll be heading to Uvalde, Texas, to speak to those families. As I speak, those parents are literally preparing to bury their children, in the United States of America, bury their children. There is too much violence, too much fear, too much grief,” Biden told graduates Saturday at the University of Delaware commencement ceremony.\n\nFor Biden, the trip represented a somber duty to join grieving families in their darkest moments. He often draws upon his own experience of losing two children – a young daughter to a car crash and his adult son to brain cancer – to console fellow parents.\n\n“To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. There’s a hollowness in your chest, and you feel like you’re being sucked into it and never going to be able to get out. It’s suffocating. And it’s never quite the same,” Biden said the night of the shooting, speaking from the Roosevelt Room shortly after returning from a two-country visit to Asia.\n\nPresident Joe Biden embraces Mandy Gutierrez, the principal of Robb Elementary School, as he and first lady Jill Biden visit Uvalde, Texas, on Sunday. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn Uvalde, a community shattered by last week’s shooting, many came to watch the President and first lady make their way through the memorial site.\n\n“I think President Biden making an appearance here is good. It’s in order. That’s what we need. We need the leader of the free world to be here, and sympathize and empathize with us,” said Ronald Garza, an Uvalde County Commissioner, on CNN.\n\nThe Bidens’ visit to Texas came 12 days after the couple traveled to Buffalo, New York, to visit the site of a racist massacre at a grocery store. That shooting left 10 people dead. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the city on Saturday to attend the funeral for 86-year-old Ruth Whitfield, the oldest victim of the attack.\n\n“This is a moment that requires all good people who are loving people to just say we will not stand for this. Enough is enough,” Harris said before laying a bouquet at a memorial outside the Tops Friendly Markets store where the shooting occurred May 14. As she left, Harris issued a call to ban assault weapons like the ones used to kill in Uvalde and Buffalo.\n\nThe dual visits by the President and vice president to communities afflicted by mass murder were a striking reminder of the scourge of gun violence consuming the nation. Biden, who has spent much of his career working to enact stricter gun laws, again called for action this week.\n\nBut he stopped short of demanding Congress pass any specific bill; the White House says it is up to Democratic leaders in the Senate to determine how to proceed on potential legislation. And he hasn’t named a gun violence task force beyond officials already inside the administration.\n\nBiden and his aides also concede there is little more he can achieve through executive action that could prevent the types of massacres that now occur with gruesome frequency.\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Dick Durbin, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he sensed a “different feeling,” among his colleagues in Congress when it comes to the possibility of passing gun control measures in the wake of the Uvalde shooting. But the Illinois Democrat suggested to CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” that if anything passed, it would be limited in scope due to the need to compromise with Republicans.\n\nIn Texas, Biden also confronted harrowing accounts of the shooting that even state law enforcement officials said amounted to a failing by police. The decision by responding officers not to enter the classroom where the shooting occurred – despite 911 calls from students pleading for help – leaves open the question of whether some lives could have been saved.\n\nThe White House has said it will not prejudge an investigation into the actions of police. But the timeline disclosures, made Friday during a harrowing news conference in Uvalde, only added to the sense of anguish Biden confronted during his visit.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Arlette Saenz", "Kevin Liptak", "Arlette Saenz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/29"}]}

It could mean having to buy a whole new wardrobe or even parting with something near and dear to them.\n\nBut those lost items are sometimes given a second chapter thanks to Unclaimed Baggage, a store and e-commerce site that resells many items that vanish during travel.\n\n“Airlines really are great in reuniting lost luggage,” Sonni Hood, public relations manager at Unclaimed Baggage, told me. But, she said, “a fraction of a percent adds up quickly when you consider that millions of people fly every day.”\n\nThe store in Scottsboro, Alabama, said it introduces about 7,000 items to its shelves every day, and the online shopping portal sees about 5,000 new items each week.\n\nIn a new report that Unclaimed Baggage plans to release annually, the store details the most common items in lost bags for the year.\n\n“The different things that are happening in our culture eventually find their way into what people are packing in their suitcase,” Hood said.\n\nAccording to the Found Report, some of the most common items in 2023 were underwear, shoes and tablets/e-readers. (Sonni swore an oath that the store sells only unused underwear, so go forth with your shopping in peace.)\n\nShe also said lost luggage can teach you a lot about consumer trends. Lululemon is clearly having a moment – it’s one of the most popular brands in the store right now. Stanley cups also saw a spike in appearances in 2023, edging out Yetis and other thermos brands that were more popular in the past. Even electronics come and go in waves.\n\n“Last year we found hardly any DSs, (but) we found so many Nintendo Switches,” Hood said.\n\nThe report also details some of the more novel finds of 2023, including two live snakes, 19 Rolex watches, a jar full of shark teeth, and a Halloween card from the 1980s signed by President Richard Nixon.\n\nHow to avoid losing your bags when you travel\n\nHood said there are simple steps travelers can take to make it less likely they lose their stuff in the first place – or more likely they’re reunited with it if something goes wrong.\n\nHere are her essential tips:\n\nLabel your bag inside and out with your name and up-to-date contact information.\n\nRemove old stickers and bag tags from your checked luggage.\n\nMake your suitcase stand out on the carousel so someone doesn’t accidentally take it.\n\nPack all your essentials, like medicines, in your carry-on bag.\n\nAnd finally, don’t rush.\n\n“Whenever you’re getting off the plane, it’s so easy to leave your Kindle or a cellphone or your glasses in the seat,” Hood said. So take a second to really make sure you have everything with you before you depart.\n\nAs someone who once left his jacket in the overhead bin and then spent hours trying to find it at the lost and found in London Heathrow Airport, I agree.\n\nAs Hood said earlier, airlines are generally pretty good about reuniting passengers with lost items. I did get that jacket back, for example. Here’s the process at the four largest U.S. airlines if you lose something on your trip.\n\nAmerican Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nAmerican recommends filing a report with the airport or with the Transportation Security Administration if you know you lost your stuff on the ground. But if you lost it on an aircraft or in a lounge, or you’re not sure where along your journey you may have left your things, there’s a process for filing a claim through AA.\n\nAccording to American, once you file a claim, the airline will search for your items for up to 30 days. For lost baggage specifically, American requires you to make a report in person at the Baggage Services Office within four hours of landing. You'll also need to submit an online claim form and a checklist of the items when reporting a lost bag and requesting reimbursement for any of its contents.\n\nFor all other individual items, AA has an online claim form, accessible by clicking here.\n\nDelta Air Lines' lost luggage process\n\nDelta has online forms for lost, delayed or damaged bags and missing, nonchecked items that were lost on board, in a Delta lounge or in the gate area.\n\nAccording to the airline, it will search for lost bags for about 21 days, and 30 days for lost nonchecked items after receiving a report. The airline recommends being as detailed as possible in your missing-items report and filing the report within seven days of noticing the items are missing.\n\nUnited Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nUnited has an online claims process for lost luggage that hasn’t been found within five days of your arrival. The airline recommends going to the Baggage Service Airport if your luggage hasn’t arrived when you land or calling the Baggage Recovery Center if you’ve already left the airport. United requires passengers to report missing bags within 24 hours within the U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and Puerto Rico and within seven days at international destinations.\n\nFor missing nonchecked items, United also has an online form.\n\nSouthwest Airlines' lost luggage process\n\nSouthwest requires passengers to file a report in person at the airport’s Baggage Service Offices if their bag does not arrive or to file an online report if they have already left the airport.\n\nSouthwest requires passengers to make their claim within four hours of arrival for a domestic flight and within seven days for an international itinerary.\n\nThe missing-bag claim form also has an option for missing nonchecked items.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

Here are your rights", "text": "The bright orange Kenneth Cole suitcase circled the baggage claim carousel at Dallas Love Field with what looked like an antenna.\n\nA piece of wire was all that remained of the retractable handle on the hardside bag.\n\nI pushed it into the Southwest Airlines baggage claim office to file a claim, short on time and unsure of what came next. It was the first time an airline damaged my bag. Delayed bags, I knew the drill. Lost bags, too, as an airline permanently lost a bag of mine several years ago.\n\nHere's what I learned: Travelers have options when it comes to damaged bags, and knowing your rights will put you in a better position to resolve the claim.\n\nIf you have a claim, that is. An airline's definition of damage, backed by the U.S. Department of Transportation, may differ significantly from a passenger's definition. Normal wear and tear, including scratches, scuff marks, stains, dents and dirt, are not covered.\n\nEvery airline damaged bag policy has a disclaimer about normal wear and tear. And it applies even if you bought the suitcase the night before your flight or are checking a designer bag.\n\n\"If you have a Louis Vuitton (bag) and it goes through the (conveyor) belt system, it is not white glove service,'' said Lisa Ouimette, an analyst in American Airlines' central baggage services office. \"These are belt loaders. If you have a brand new bag, expect it to have normal wear and tear.''\n\nAirlines also reserve the right to deny claims to passengers with damage caused by overstuffed bags, such as broken zippers, as well as poor quality bags and bags that were damaged when checked in.\n\nSo what is covered?\n\nDamage to luggage components including wheels, handles, straps and other glaring problems, such as holes or a cracked hardside bag, are covered. The latter is a big problem in cold weather, Ouimette said. (So are removable straps, which regularly get stuck in the bag loading systems, so take them off, she said.)\n\n\"We anticipate damage and when it does happen, we have a plan in place to take care of our customers,'' she said.\n\nPassenger rights if an airline damages your bag\n\nMore than 87 percent of U.S. travelers don't file claims against airlines following an issue with lost, damaged or delayed luggage, according to a survey earlier this year by AirHelp, a service that helps passengers get compensation for claims against airlines. The three main reasons: They didn't think they would be entitled to compensation, they were not aware of their rights and they did not know how to file a claim.\n\nAirlines are responsible for repairing or reimbursing a passenger for damaged baggage and/or its contents when the damage occurs while the bag is under the airline’s control, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection division.\n\nThe cheapest option for airlines is a bag repair. Many use Dallas-based Rynn's Luggage, which bills itself as the largest airline luggage repair and replacement service in the country.\n\nIf a bag cannot be repaired, it will be replaced with a like bag or passengers will be reimbursed. The reimbursement is based on the value of the bag and its depreciation, the DOT says, subject to liability limits.\n\nFor flights within the United States, the maximum liability for a lost, delayed or damaged bag is $3,500. The limit on international flights, per the Montreal Convention, is about $1,600, the agency says.\n\nAirlines are free to pay more but there is no requirement to do so, according to the DOT.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're going to get $3,500 or anything close to it if a wheel fell off your bag or your handle was destroyed. (The higher limits generally apply to a lost suitcase full of pricey personal belongings.)\n\nMy suitcase wasn't new and had plenty of scuffs, but the broken retractable handle was clearly a big problem. I worried that Delta Air Lines, which I was flying the next day out of Dallas, wouldn't accept it, or would have me sign a waiver absolving them of any liability should it get further damaged.\n\nSouthwest baggage representatives in Dallas were friendly and apologetic and didn't doubt I needed a new bag. But they were clearly trying to limit their liability. (I never identify myself as a travel reporter for fear of getting special treatment, a violation of our ethics policy.)\n\nThey asked how old my bag was, where I purchased it and how much I paid for it. They took photos and went to a back room computer to search for a similar bag online. They couldn't find one, or only found heavily discounted bags. I didn't recall how much my bag was or where I purchased it but estimated it at between $150 and $200. A repair never came up.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised me, they wheeled out a couple new bags about the same size as my bag. One was a hardside bag, the other a traditional suitcase, and both had spinner wheels and a retractable handle, like mine. The hardside bag wouldn't fit all of my stuff and both bags looked relatively cheap, so I initially passed.\n\nAmerican's Ouimette said airlines keep so-called stock bags on hand for cases where passengers immediately need a new bag. She ordered a bunch for American for the busy holiday season. Many passengers love them because their damaged bag is older and they are thrilled to get a new one.\n\nI was pickier and wanted something decent for the hassle.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me if I bought a new bag and brought a receipt for a similar bag on my way out of Dallas the next morning. I didn't have time to shop during my 24-hour visit and needed a suitcase, so eventually decided to take them up on the stock bag.\n\nIn the middle of the baggage claim office, I unpacked my broken bag and transferred everything to the new softside bag.\n\nI wheeled it out of the office and into the corridor heading to the airport's Uber pick-up area. I didn't make it. The wheels kept circling, sending me a couple steps back for every step forward.\n\nI fumbled my way back to the baggage claim office and told them the bag didn't work. They were apologetic, again. I repacked everything into the broken bag and pushed it through the corridor and headed out.\n\nSouthwest said they would reimburse me for whatever bag I bought, never setting a price limit. I didn't buy one in Dallas; a generous friend I was staying with gave me a big suitcase they were no longer using.\n\nJust before Christmas, enticed by the offer of free expedited shipping, I bought a bag I'd had my eye on, a $245 Away carry-on bag . It was nowhere near as big as the Kenneth Cole one Southwest broke, but my friend's bag took care of my big-bag needs and I was in desperate need of a sturdy new carry-on bag.\n\nMy claim was finally resolved the day after Christmas in Phoenix. I landed at Sky Harbor International Airport after midnight and headed to the baggage claim office while waiting for bags to arrive after my flight from Providence.\n\nI submitted my receipt for $260, which included taxes. It took the agents time to find my claim because I didn't have my \"damage incident report'' and they were having computer issues.\n\nA supervisor offered $200, a figure noted in my report by the Dallas agents. I told her they said to buy any bag and bring the receipt, no money figure mentioned, due to my hassles with the stock bag.\n\n\"We'll split the difference, how's that?'' she asked.\n\nAt 1 a.m., I walked out of the office with a check for $225.\n\n5 things to do if an airline damages your bag\n\n1. Head to the baggage claim office immediately if possible. You have up to 24 hours to report a claim for domestic flights and seven days for international flights on most carriers, though policies vary by airline. Southwest and JetBlue require claims within four hours; Frontier, 12 hours. It's easiest to do in person, having everything documented on-site instead of spending time on the phone and uploading claim documents online. Plus, you might be offered a replacement bag on the spot if you're not picky about a new bag.\n\n2. Don't rip off your baggage tags. The airline will need them.\n\n3. Be calm and courteous. A banged-up bag is a bad way to begin or end a trip, but blasting the baggage claim representative for a missing wheel or hole in your bag isn't going to help your claim or get it resolved more quickly.\n\n4. Know the approximate value of your bag and where you purchased it to give you some negotiating leverage in case of reimbursement.\n\n5. Jot down names of airline representatives and details discussed and stay on top of the claims process if it's not resolved immediately. Airlines issue a claim number and updates can be found online. Not getting the answers you want? Ask to talk to someone in the airport office where you submitted the claim or a representative in the airline's central baggage services office.\n\nMajor airline policies on damaged bags:\n\nAlaska Airlines\n\nAllegiant Air\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nDelta Air Lines\n\nFrontier Airlines\n\nJetBlue Airways\n\nSouthwest Airlines\n\nSpirit Airlines\n\nUnited Airlines\n\nMore:Travel nightmares: What to do if you miss your flight", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2019/10/04/ditch-your-luggage-baggage-shipping-services-wearable-baggage/3851242002/", "title": "Ditch your luggage: Save money by shipping it in advance or ...", "text": "Christopher Elliott\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIt's time to downsize your luggage.\n\nThe latest travel trend is ditching your regulation-size rollaboard for a smaller, more compact carry-on or even \"wearable\" luggage. These devices help you to avoid all the obstacles, restrictions and fees that airlines and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) throw in your path.\n\nLast year, airlines collected a cool $4.8 billion in baggage fees, up about 6% from 2017. They also continue to lose checked luggage, although their numbers are slowly improving.\n\nAnd no one likes to rifle through your luggage more than the TSA, with its odd liquid restrictions and a long list of banned items.\n\nWho wants to mess with all that? Enter the luggage-free movement.\n\nOne method involves passengers sending large bags – the kind you'd typically check – ahead to their destinations through a delivery service such as FedEx or UPS a few days before departure or even overnight. They then downsize their carry-on items to a small personal overnight bag.\n\nIn extreme cases, usually involving a \"low-cost\" carrier that charges for carry-on bags, passengers stuff their pockets with a change of clothes, medications and essential electronics. Look, Ma, no bag!\n\nChecking luggage isn't your only option anymore\n\nAll of which may make you wonder: Is luggage as we know it becoming obsolete?\n\nIt is for Nancy Aronson, a retired legislative worker from Washington.\n\n\"We mail a box with hiking shoes, and anything else we can cram into one large Priority Mail box and send it to our family when we visit them in Hawaii,\" she says. \"It's cheaper than an extra suitcase.\"\n\nThere are more sophisticated ways to send your luggage than through the postal service. LugLess, for example, allows you to send your luggage via FedEx. Just print a label and drop it off at any FedEx location. Luggage Forward will even pick up the luggage and drop it off at your location.\n\nThe services work similarly, bypassing your airline's unreliable luggage delivery system.\n\nLess is more for your luggage\n\nWhen it comes to carry-on items, things are getting really small. Take Christopher Smithmyer, a vice president for an international conflict management company who is based in Dysart, Pennsylvania. For him, large carry-on bags are out. What's in? Not much.\n\n\"When I have a short flight or a day trip, I don't take luggage with me. Most of the time, I still have a personal item, a backpack in which I keep a set of spare clothes,\" he says.\n\nNewest carry-on bags do more with less room: How to get all your gear in a smaller bag\n\nSmithmyer and other frequent travelers agree that the Holy Grail of luggage minimization is no carry-on bag and no personal item: just the clothes on your back. That's not always practical. Wearing what you would usually pack in your luggage works only for overnight trips.\n\n\"For most people, you can go three days with only a personal item,\" Smithmyer says. \"If you are staying about a week, bite the bullet and check a bag.\"\n\nIf you want to squeeze everything into wearable luggage, you have plenty of options. Luggage minimalism isn't a new concept, but travelers such as Smithmyer are going to greater lengths to pursue it.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nWhy is your need for baggage shrinking, even vanishing? It's not just the sky-high luggage fees and the airline industry's so-so record for keeping track of your belongings.\n\nEven if you manage to avoid checked luggage fees, you still have to wrestle all of your belongings onto the plane. Then you must fight with your fellow passengers for precious overhead bin space.\n\nThere has to be a better way, right?\n\nWell, there is. Instead of trying to stuff all of your personal belongings into your pockets, airlines could ease up on their luggage restrictions and fees.\n\nWhy not include the price of the first and second bag, as a small number of civilized international airlines do? Why not offer roomier overhead bins for carry-on bags? And for cryin' out loud, why not stop charging people for their carry-ons, as some \"low cost\" airlines do?\n\nReally, it's gone too far. Your baggage shouldn't have to become obsolete. But on some of the airlines stoking this trend, maybe it will.\n\nHere's the best wearable luggage\n\nDon't worry: With this gear, you won't end up looking like Joey wearing the entire contents of Chandler's closet on \"Friends.\"\n\nBaubax: In 2015, the BauBax Travel Jacket raised more than $11.6 million on Kickstarter to become the most funded apparel and travel product in crowdfunding history. Its vests and jackets have ample room for phones, batteries, headphones and even a change of clothes.\n\nClothing Arts: Another well-regarded travel jacket comes from Clothing Arts. Its Cubed Travel Jacket features special security closures and two generous interior pockets that can carry almost anything. It's waterproof and breathable.\n\nSCOTTeVEST: The most established line of wearable luggage, SCOTTeVEST, was originally designed to carry electronics.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov.

Don’t go out.”\n\nHe said emergency responders will go, and have gone, to homes without heat and take people to warming shelters. Too many people, including residents just going out to see the massive snowfall, are going out in their vehicles and getting stuck and blocking recovery efforts, he said.\n\nErie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted that 14 people in the county had died of exposure, three people were found in their vehicles, four had no heat, three were from “shoveling/(snow) blowing cardiac events, and three people passed away after EMS services were delayed.\n\nHe told CNN that unfortunately it appears the numbers will go up.\n\n“I am aware of additional bodies that have been recovered and are being brought to our temporary morgue,” he told The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. “We’ve had so many bodies that various hospitals are full and we’re just having to go through and determine if the individuals have died from a blizzard-related death.”\n\n“It’s just been a horrible, horrible situation,” he added.\n\nThe deadly storm comes just one month after the region was slammed with a historic snowstorm.\n\nAnd snow was continuing to fall Monday. At a morning news conference, Poloncarz noted officials expect between 8 and 12 more inches of snow to fall between Monday morning and 1 p.m. Tuesday. “This is not helpful as we’re trying to recover and clear off streets and get into areas that still have not” been plowed, he said.\n\nWhile driving bans have been lifted in some communities, one such order remains in place in Buffalo, Poloncarz said, describing the city is “impassable in most areas,” with abandoned vehicles scattered everywhere.\n\nEven emergency and recovery vehicles sent out to help have gotten stuck in the snow as rescue crews and hundreds of snowplow drivers fanned out on Christmas. Eleven abandoned ambulances were dug out Sunday, officials said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See houses frozen over by massive winter storm 01:00 - Source: CNN\n\n“We had to send specialized rescue crews to go get the rescuers,” Poloncarz told “CNN This Morning” Monday, adding it was the worst storm he could remember. “It was just horrendous, and it was horrendous for 24 hours in a row.”\n\n“We’re used to snow here, we can handle snow,” he said. “But with the wind, the blinding views – it was complete whiteouts – and the extreme cold, it was some of the worst conditions that any of us have ever seen.”\n\nSnow covers downtown Buffalo, New York, on Monday, December 26, 2022, in this photo from New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's Twitter page. Gov. Kathy Hochul/Twitter/AP\n\nThe storm has drawn widespread comparisons to Buffalo’s famous blizzard of 1977. Poloncarz said in Monday’s news conference the current storm’s “ferocity … was worse than the blizzard of ’77.” The death toll in that storm was 23 people, 22 of whom died in Erie County.\n\nAnd in a news conference Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called this storm the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history.” On Monday, she requested President Joe Biden issue federal emergency declarations for Erie and Genesee counties.\n\n“I spoke with @GovKathyHochul to get an update on the extreme winter weather hitting New York,” Biden tweeted. “We stand ready to make sure they have the resources they need to get through this. My heart is with those who lost loved ones this holiday weekend. You are in my and Jill’s prayers.”\n\nHundreds of National Guard troops have been deployed to help with rescue efforts in New York. State police had been involved in over 500 rescues by Sunday, including delivering a baby, Hochul said.\n\nWhile abandoned vehicles pepper the snow-covered roadways, conditions are also difficult inside homes.\n\nSome residents have remained in their homes for more than two days, some without power in the freezing cold, Hochul said Sunday – due not to a lack of resources, but the challenges utility companies face in terms of mobility and access. As of Sunday evening, however, 94.5% of Erie County residents and 87% of Buffalo residents have had their power restored, Hochul said.\n\nAs of Monday, fewer than 10,000 customers were without power, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said in an afternoon news conference, adding temperatures in his own home dropped to 40 degrees. “We certainly understand the challenges that so many families are going through and the frustration that people are facing.”\n\nWinter storm warnings remain in effect in New York for Jefferson and Lewis counties until 1 p.m. Tuesday. Forecasts show an additional 8 to 16 inches of snow could fall, according to the National Weather Service. Erie County could see another 4 to 8 inches and is under a winter weather advisory.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Since the start of the storm, the number of outages has at times exceeded a million customers.\n\nElectricity was not the sole utility impacted: Jackson, Mississippi, issued a boil water notice Sunday after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks “likely caused by the weather,” officials said on Facebook.

Daniel Kim/The Seattle Times/AP In pictures: Winter storm impacts the US Prev Next\n\nIn all, more than 200 million people in the US were under wind chill alerts from the Canadian border to the Mexican border and from Washington state to Florida, with below-zero wind chills expected in the Southeast by Friday. Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware. Further, all express services for Sound Transit, a regional transportation network in the Seattle metro area, were suspended Friday due to the icy conditions.\n\nA winter storm warning is also in effect for northeastern Oregon, including Portland, from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. PST. Total snow and sleet accumulations of up to one inch and ice accumulations of .2 to .4 inches is likely as well as winds gusting to 55 mph. Wind chills as low as zero are possible, and frostbite is possible on exposed skin in as little as 30 minutes.\n\nOne of the biggest dangers of the massive winter storm besides heavy snow and blizzard conditions is the rapid drop in temperatures over a short period of time. The air will continue to get and feel colder, especially during night hours.", "authors": ["Aya Elamroussi Ray Sanchez Eric Levenson", "Aya Elamroussi", "Ray Sanchez", "Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://college.usatoday.com/2015/01/29/7-tips-for-planning-the-best-spring-break-possible/", "title": "7-tips-for-planning-the-best-spring-break-possible", "text": "Lauren Blum\n\nPenn State University\n\nThe weather may be frigid, but that doesn’t mean you can't warm up to the idea of getting away for spring break in local, tropical or international locations.\n\nWith only several weeks until many students prepare to embark on the quintessential college vacation with friends, plans are starting to evolve into solidified realities and the panic may start to kick in. Where should I book my flight? How much spending money should I bring? What will my friends and I do while we are there?\n\nNever fear! Here are a few simple tips to help you plan the perfect spring break trip.\n\nBreak the stereotype\n\nChoose a destination that you and your friends actually want to go to — not a common hotspot just because it is the ‘normal’ thing to do.\n\nIf getting crazy in Cancun is not your idea of fun, opt for relaxation on a chill island, an adventure in Europe or a ski trip in Colorado. If you would rather donate your time, join a mission or community service trip through your university or favorite philanthropy. For career-minded students, check if your school offers internships or tours while you are on break at companies that peak your interest.\n\nIf getting on a plane is too much effort and money, don’t feel bad about chilling at home with family — they miss you and enjoy the company, even if you are asleep or binge-watching Netflix during 95% of the time.\n\nBook early and rigorously research the best deals\n\nBooking hotels and flights can be a major headache in planning your vacation. The easiest way to avoid astronomical costs and complications is to book as far in advance as possible. Be sure to compare round-trip flights on as many travel and airline websites as possible. It is important to note that you should not book the least expensive airline just because it is cheapest — make sure to verify that the company is reliable and has decent ratings. Also, researching and reading reviews on websites such as Yelp and TripAdvisor is helpful in finding clean, reasonably priced and safe places to stay.\n\nMake a bucket list\n\nFrom the start of your planning, gather your friends and create a running list of activities and other events everyone wants to conquer. Even if you don’t end up following it and decide to go with the flow, it is a great tool to help quickly conjure up ideas when you are hungry and searching for good eats or looking for a new party spot to check out when your original plans fell through. Create a Google doc so everyone can access it and edit it at anytime, providing a personal planner at your fingertips.\n\nPlan a budget and stick to it\n\nIt can be hard to stay on a budget when planning a big trip. With tourist temptations on every corner, it is easy to get caught up and overspend.\n\nDon’t use your credit card — just don’t do it. Having a card on hand in case of emergency is essential, but swiping until your heart is content will make you and your wallet unhappy in the long run. Take a set amount of cash with you — some for spending and some for emergency purposes — and you will find it is much easier to control when it is visibly dwindling as the trip continues.\n\nIndulge in something if you really feel you cannot live without it or you cannot leave without doing it, but don’t agree to it if you won’t appreciate it after the fact.\n\nUse apps\n\nThere is no need for travel agents, bulky maps, brochures or complicated payment systems with the help of the glowing screen in your palm. Downloading apps such as Citymapper — the free ultimate transit app for navigating large cities— can help you explore like a pro in the quickest and cheapest way possible.\n\nHaving trouble getting your group to pay their share of a joint bill on time? Use Tilt to pool money to pay for a shared hotel, concert or other event in preparation of your trip, ensuring one person is never left fronting the bill for someone else.\n\nWhile apps can be easy and effective tools, avoid over-sharing on social media so people cannot pinpoint your exact location. Also, consider steering clear of dating apps like Tinder when trying to meet people in a new city during a short amount of time. You can never be sure who is really behind that screen and you don’t want to waste your valuable days figuring it out or picking up the pieces later.\n\nBe responsible\n\nYou most likely hear this all the time, but it is crucial to be careful about drinking during spring break. Being responsible can help avoid embarrassment, poor decisions and health risks that can ruin a vacation entirely.\n\nResearch the liquor laws of your destination, not only for the drinking age, but also for laws about open container, drinking on the beach or in public, etc. Avoid drinking and staying out in the sun — alcohol consumption can lead to behavioral changes that increase the risk of sunburn, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt is important to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated, whether one chooses to drink alcohol or not. If swimming in the ocean, be careful of riptides and other hazardous conditions. From inability to float in the water, to falling on the dance floor, to colliding in a ski accident, getting injured — especially in foreign countries — can be an uncomfortable, unpleasant and expensive process.\n\nBe prepared for the unknown and always be safe\n\nThough spring breakers can try their best to make everything run smoothly, things don’t always go as planned. If changes happen, don’t let them soil your whole trip — you are there to have fun and escape from stress.\n\nLost luggage or delays should not totally upset your vacation (although you should definitely pack at least two outfits in a carryon just in the off-chance this would occur.)\n\nThough it is a repetitive lesson, it is important to stay safe. Never travel alone, always have a charged cell phone and be aware of your surroundings. When going out, it is important to decide upon a designated meeting spot where you and your friends will know to find each other if anyone gets lost or separated. Being proactive and staying in communication with your friends will save you from worrying and allow more time to let loose and enjoy your time off.\n\n\n\nLauren Blum is a student at Pennsylvania State University and a spring 2015 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.\n\nThis story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

Other artists who Swift ranks ahead of include Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Adele and Usher.\n\nSwift was previously Billboard's top artist of 2023.\n\nIn a write-up explaining the choice, Billboard's Hannah Dailey said that Swift, \"through honoring all the traits that made her different,\" was \"able to forcefully, gravitationally bend culture to her will and become one of the world’s biggest undisputed pop stars, despite her eight-year late start in country music.\"\n\nNeed a break?

Few genres have fully embraced the euphoric potential of pop music with the unabashed dedication to delivering that sugar rush on which this type of music thrives as K-pop.\n\nIn its more infectious moments, it's a technicolor hook explosion on 11 or what NPR once called \"a maximalist dreamland\" of \"constant stimulation.\"\n\nK-pop makes most Western pop stars seem like they're not even trying.\n\nWith BTS about to blow up even bigger, here’s a look back at a handful of key moments on the road to K-pop being what a recent eight-part YouTube documentary series on the genre calls a $10 billion industry.\n\nWho started K-pop?\n\nThere's a long tradition of pop music in Korea, from Trot, a form of folk music whose name is derived from the English word foxtrot, to rock acts like the Key Boys, whose Yardbirds-style rockers played well to American GIs in the '60s.\n\nBut Seo Taiji and Boys are often credited with modernizing the contemporary music scene of South Korea with their breakthrough single \"Nan Arayo (I Know).\" Rapping and singing in Korean over new jack swing beats and turntable scratching in an energetic, choreographed video, they clearly paved the way for modern K-pop. Their success with teenagers inspired the Korean music industry to shift its focus to pop that would play well to that age group.\n\nIn the YouTube documentary \"K-pop Evolution,\" producer Hong Jong Ho says, \"Korean pop music is divided into 'before' and 'after' the debut of Seo Taiji and Boys.\"\n\nThe modern era of K-pop\n\nFormed in 1996, the boy band H.O.T. is credited with ushering in the age of modern K-pop idol culture, in which members of a pop group are assembled by a company, in this case SM Entertainment, and marketed to teenagers.\n\nTheir name stands for Highfive of Teenagers.\n\nAccording to the book \"K-Pop: Korea's Musical Explosion,\" SM Entertainment's Lee Soo-man polled high school students on what they wanted from a pop group. That information was then used to hand-select the members of the group, who then went through rigorous training to achieve their full potential as teen idols.\n\nA year after the launch of SM Entertainment, H.O.T. became the hottest name in K-pop thanks to the contagious bubblegum appeal of 1996's hip-hop-flavored \"Candy.\"\n\nBillboard says they're \"typically identified as the first formal K-pop boy band.\"\n\nThat success led to another wave of K-pop idol groups, including S.E.S., a group initially assembled by the folks at SM Entertainment as a female counterpart to H.O.T.\n\nThe same year H.O.T. broke through with \"Candy,\" Yang Hyun-suk of Seo Taiji & Boys formed YG Entertainment. A year later, Park Jin-young launched JYP Entertainment.\n\nBTS' label, Big Hit Music, came much later, launched in 2005 by Bang Si-hyuk. Thanks in large part to the international success the label has enjoyed with BTS, it recently purchased the management company that handles Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande.\n\nK-pop makes its first appearance in Billboard\n\nThe term K-pop made its first appearance in the pages of Billboard magazine in 1999 in an article on South Korea lessening restrictions on Japanese acts performing in the country. Kim Chang-Hwan, a producer, is quoted as saying, \"The rock-oriented J-pop scene is not what melody-oriented K-pop listeners are asking for.\"\n\nExcept he didn't really call it that.\n\nLooking back in 2019 on the article he'd done as Billboard's South Korea correspondent, Cho Hyun-jin explained that Kim had used the Korean term gayo and that he and an editor were brainstorming ideas for something that sounded a bit more accessible.\n\n“Personally, I didn't hear the term ‘K-pop’ before,\" Cho recalled. \"It might have been used. I read some articles when I was working on my pieces that the word ‘K-pop’ was used by the music industry insiders. But to tell the truth, I never heard it personally.”\n\nWhat is K-pop?\n\nObviously, K-pop means Korean pop music, but the term is more fluid than that.\n\nWhen Cho started using the term he soon found himself applying it to any pop act out of South Korea, a usage that lingers.\n\nBut to many, it applies specifically to K-pop idol culture. As Cho explained in Billboard, \"I guess the term ‘K-pop’ really started to define the agency-produced or managed idol bands, or sometimes solo acts.\"\n\nWhat are K-pop stans?\n\nAmong the key factors in spreading the gospel of K-pop across the universe has been the intense devotion of the fans – or stans (in reference to the Eminem obsessed-fan anthem, “Stan”) – of individual K-pop groups.\n\nBTS’ fandom is called \"A.R.M.Y,\" an acronym for \"Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth.” Blackpink’s fandom name is Blink.\n\nIn addition to singing the praises of their favorite K-pop idols, K-pop stans became a force on Twitter last year after flooding anti-Black Lives Matter hashtags with videos and photos of their favorite K-pop acts to undermine the racists’ efforts at spreading the hate.\n\nThey also earned a shout-out in a tweet from U.S. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and joining TikTok users in requesting tickets to former President Trump’s Tulsa rally with no intention of going, which resulted in a disappointing turnout.\n\nA new generation of 21st century K-pop Idols\n\nA new generation of K-pop idols emerged in the early 2000s, led by TVXQ, a boy band whose name roughly translates to Rising Gods of the East, and BoA, a solo artist often called the Queen of K-pop.\n\nWith SM Entertainment's support, both acts are credited with expanding the audience base for South Korean music. BoA was the first K-pop artist to top the Japanese music charts, followed by TVXQ, who won Album of the year at South Korea's Golden Disc Awards in 2006 and 2008 for the nation's biggest-selling albums of those years.\n\nFueled by social media and the popularity of K-pop music videos on YouTube, the Korean Wave, or Hallyu, as it's known, quickly expanded from East and Southeast Asia to all corners of the globe.\n\nOther artists that have played a key role in expanding K-pop's global impact in the 21st century include the solo singer Rain, who played to 40,000 fans at a sold-out concert in Beijing, and the groups Super Junior, BIGBANG, Wonder Girls, SHINee, 2NE1 and SuperM, a K-pop supergroup whose first release topped Billboard's album chart.\n\n'Gangnam Style'\n\nThe first South Korean pop act to go viral in the States was PSY, whose music video for \"Gangnam Style\" was the first to reach one billion views on YouTube, a threshold it hit in December 2012 (a year after K-pop became the first country-specific genre with its own YouTube channel).\n\nA wildly entertaining video whose popularity is based at least in part on the infectious energy with which the singer throws himself into his goofy dance moves, \"Gangnam Style\" has since passed the 4 billion mark on YouTube.\n\nIt also topped the charts in more than 30 countries, hitting No. 2 in the U.S., becoming such a massive mainstream cultural phenomenon Madonna invited the singer to join her and her backup dancers in a mashup of her own song, \"Give it 2 Me,\" and \"Gangnam Style\" at Madison Square Garden.\n\nTwo subsequent singles put PSY back in the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100 — \"Gentleman,\" which broke a YouTube record for how fast it hit 1 billion views, and \"Hangover,\" featuring Snoop Dogg.\n\nGirls' Generation, EXO and Blackpink\n\nGirls' Generation, Billboard's pick in 2017 for top K-pop girl group of the past decade, rose to fame in 2009 on the strength of a sugar-coated electropop single called \"Gee.\" That song went on to be named the most popular single of the decade by the South Korean online music service Melon.\n\nAnother massive boy band, EXO, had the biggest-selling South Korean album five years in a row, from 2013 to 2017.\n\nWhen that streak ended, it gave way to three straight years of BTS at No. 1, they dropped their biggest-selling album yet, 2018's \"Don't Mess Up My Tempo,\" which became the third K-pop album to go Top 40 on the Billboard album chart, following BTS and Blackpink.\n\nA South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment in 2016, Blackpink has enjoyed the most US success of any K-pop girl group.\n\nThey became the highest-charting female Korean act on Billboard's Hot 100 when they peaked at No. 13 with 2020's \"Ice Cream,\" a seductive dance track with guest vocals by Selena Gomez. And that was Blackpink's third Top 40 entry on that US chart, following \"Kill This Love\" and \"How You Like That.\"\n\nBlackpink also had the highest-charting entry by a female Korean act on Billboard's album chart with \"The Album,\" which became the first Korean girl group album to sell more than one million copies.\n\nIs BTS the most popular group on the planet?\n\nLast year, BTS was declared \"the most popular group on the planet\" by Maria Sherman, author of \"Larger Than Life: A History of Boy Bands from NKOTB to BTS,\" in an article she wrote for NPR, pointing to the billions they bring in each year to South Korea.\n\nRolling Stone threw its support behind that theory in its latest issue with the cover story headline \"BTS: The Nonstop Triumphs of the World's Biggest Band.\"\n\nConsider the following firsts.\n\nIn 2017, they became the first K-pop performers to take home a Billboard Music Award and the first to perform at the American Music Awards.\n\nThe following year, they were the first K-pop artists to play a U.S. stadium and the first group to top the Billboard album chart with \"Love Yourself: Tear.\"\n\nThey've since returned to No. 1 with four releases — the \"Love Yourself: Answer\" compilation, the \"Map of the Soul: Persona\" EP and the full-length albums \"Map of the Soul: 7\" (the biggest-selling South Korean album of all time) and \"Be.\"\n\nIn the midst of all those chart successes, they rang in 2020 with a New Year's Eve performance in Times Square that was seen by a television audience of more than 1 billion people.\n\nAt last count, BTS had seven of the Top 10 biggest-selling South Korean albums of all time, including all three of the top positions. The other three albums in the Top 10 — by Kim Gun-mo, Lee Moon-sae and Shin Seung-hun — predated the K-pop explosion.\n\nAnd when you think about it, they're just getting started.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

Backed by her Georgia Jazz Band featuring future legends Fletcher Henderson on piano and Louis Armstrong on cornet, Rainey gives the song about love, sex and deceit a deep, emotional interpretation. She progresses from sad to mad as she moans “you made me love you” before warning of purchasing “a pistol just as long as I am tall.”\n\n‘A-Tisket, A-Tasket’ (1938) by Ella Fitzgerald\n\nNot long removed from her teenage days spent singing on the streets of Harlem, jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald shot to stardom in 1938 with her stunning performance of “A Tisket, A Tasket.” Based on an old nursery rhyme, Fitzgerald co-composed the song that went on to become a standard and put Fitzgerald on her way to being crowned the \"Queen of Jazz.\"\n\n‘Strange Fruit’ (1939) by Billie Holiday\n\nBefore most of the best-known protest singers of ’60s were even born, Billie Holiday risked her career as a rising jazz star to jump labels and record perhaps the most powerful protest song of them all, “Strange Fruit.” A devastating ballad about the lynching of Blacks in the South, Holiday’s rich, harrowing vocal made the song her biggest hit to date while offering listeners around the world a harsh snapshot of the horrors being perpetrated down in Dixie.\n\n‘Strange Things Happening Every Day’ (1944) by Sister Rosetta Tharpe\n\nSister Rosetta Tharpe’s distinctive singing and stylish lead guitar playing on this rollicking 1944 rendition of the Black spiritual make it one of the best examples of primal rock ’n’ roll. Credited as the first gospel single to cross over to the mainstream, Tharpe’s recording reached No. 2 on the Billboard “race” chart, later renamed the R&B chart.\n\n‘At Last’ (1960) by Etta James\n\nA nice enough show tune recorded by the Glenn Miller Orchestra and others throughout the 1940s and ’50s, “At Last” became a juggernaut when commanded by Etta James, who forever altered the way popular recording artists approached not just that song but, in many ways, singing in general. Polished yet highly emotive, sexy and eternally cool, James’ title track to her dazzling 1960 debut album launched her long, storied career and would go on to be successfully covered in James’ distinctive style by Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera and Beyoncé.\n\n‘Where Did Our Love Go’ (1964) by The Supremes\n\nThe Supremes released a handful of singles between 1961 and ’63 that all bricked before they issued the impossibly dulcet breakup song “Where Did Our Love Go” featuring the cooing vocals of Diana Ross. The song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and The Supremes followed it with four more No. 1 hits on their way to becoming one of the most popular acts on the planet, right up there with The Beatles, before launching the solo career of Ross.\n\n‘Mississippi Goddam’ (1964) by Nina Simone\n\nA singer, songwriter and pianist who excelled at everything from jazz and classical to blues and pop, Nina Simone penned the rousing “Mississippi Goddam” as a reaction to the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a Black Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama. The most striking protest song of the ’60s, the bouncy ditty with a booming vocal first appeared on her 1964 album “Nina Simone in Concert” recorded at Carnegie Hall. “The name of this tune is ‘Mississippi Goddam,’ ” Simone tells the crowd by way of introduction. “And I mean every word of it.”\n\n‘Respect’ (1967) by Aretha Franklin\n\nAretha Franklin’s milestone debut album for Atlantic, “I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You,” opens with the greatest cover in the history of popular music. Franklin perfected her ownership of Otis Redding’s “Respect” – adding key elements like the “sock-it-to-me” call and response – and the song became a feminist anthem for the ages.\n\n‘Nutbush City Limits’ (1973) by Tina Turner\n\nBefore Tina Turner established herself as a superstar in the 1980s with hits like “What's Love Got to Do with It,” “Private Dancer” and “We Don’t Need Another Hero (Thunderdome),” she had to break free of husband, musical partner and personal tormentor Ike Turner. One of the last singles issued by Ike & Tina Turner, “Nutbush City Limits” is a forceful rocker penned by Tina about her upbringing in rural Tennessee. It became a multi-genre hit, paving the way for her solo career and famously covered by Bob Seger as the opening cut on his multi-platinum ’76 album “Live Bullet.”\n\n‘Lady Marmalade’ (1974) by Labelle\n\nA quarter century before Christina Aguilera, Mýa, Pink and Lil’ Kim recorded it on the “Moulin Rouge!” soundtrack, funk-rock girl group Labelle featuring future solo star Patti LaBelle were the first to have a No. 1 hit with “Lady Marmalade” – shocking and elating listeners in 1974 when they sang “Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?” (Folks soon figured out that was French for “Do you want to sleep with me, tonight?”) More than just totally owning that sexy chorus, though, there’s that propulsive rhythm Labelle is rocking, which ushered in the disco era.\n\n‘Love to Love You Baby’ (1975) by Donna Summer\n\nDonna Summer’s ascent to the “Queen of Disco” throne began with her 17-minute epic “Love to Love You Baby” that consumed the entire first side of her 1975 album of the same name. Co-written by Summer and issued as a 3-minute single, the song finds her moaning and groaning in a state of sexual ecstasy never really heard before on record, leading many radio stations to refuse to play it. Regardless, the song hit No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 – with the full-length version heating up nightclubs across the U.S. and Europe – and then was heard again in 2003 as part of Beyoncé’s top five hit “Naughty Girl.”\n\n‘I’m So Excited’ (1984) by The Pointer Sisters\n\nCo-written and performed by The Pointer Sisters, “I’m So Excited” captures the thrill of finding love, perhaps only for a few red-hot hours on a Saturday night, as well as any song in pop history. Originally issued on the group’s 1982 “So Excited!” LP, a remixed version would be included on their blockbuster ’84 album “Break Out” that produced four top 10 singles: “I’m So Excited,” “Jump (For My Love),” “Automatic” and “Neutron Dance.”\n\n‘Nasty’ (1986) by Janet Jackson\n\nFreed from her controlling father/manager Joseph Jackson and husband James DeBarge, Janet Jackson made her breakthrough 1986 album “Control” that would produce five top five singles including the showstopper “Nasty.” With lyrics that only Jackson could have written and delivered with such aplomb, the song contains one memorable line after another including the pop culture touchstone: “My first name ain’t baby, it’s Janet; Miss Jackson, if you’re nasty.”\n\n‘Ladies First’ (1989) by Queen Latifah\n\nBefore becoming an Oscar-nominated movie star (2002’s “Chicago”) and gifted singer of soul/jazz standards (2004’s Grammy-nominated “The Dana Owens Album”), Queen Latifah ranked among the most important and successful rappers of her generation. While “U.N.I.T.Y.” would be her big, breakout hit in ’93, it all started with her 1989 debut album “All Hail the Queen,” featuring the formidable feminist anthem “Ladies First.”\n\n‘Vision of Love’ (1990) by Mariah Carey\n\nThe most influential pop song of the past 30 years, Mariah Carey’s 1990 debut single, which she co-wrote, is a simple enough love ditty until the vocal acrobatics come through the speakers like a some kind of new sonic superpower. Singing lead and background, Carey popularized the use of awe-inspiring vocal runs (melisma) and equally amazing high notes (the whistle register), which basically every pop singer and “American Idol” contestant has emulated since.\n\n‘I Will Always Love You’ (1992) by Whitney Houston\n\nNo entertainer has ever had been more successful than Whitney Houston in 1992. Her star vehicle “The Bodyguard” became the highest-grossing live action film of the year and its soundtrack topped the pop chart on its way to becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. Both these feats were largely propelled by the single “I Will Always Love You,” Houston’s soaring and heartbreaking R&B makeover of Dolly Parton’s country hit from the 1970s.\n\n‘Doo Wop (That Thing)’ (1998) by Lauryn Hill\n\nHip-hop became a mainstream phenomenon like never before when singer, rapper and musical genius Lauryn Hill left the Fugees and issued “Doo Wop (That Thing),” the song of the summer of ’98 and the first single off her solo masterpiece “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.” Written and produced by Hill, the chart-topping, Grammy-winning smash incorporates elements of R&B, soul and hip-hop; offering clever lines, catchy beats, and a message of mutual love and respect that sounds as fresh today as it did when first heard pouring out of car stereos 22 years ago.\n\n‘Get Ur Freak On’ (2001) by Missy Elliott\n\nCo-written with her childhood friend and longtime producer Timbaland, rapper extraordinaire Missy Elliott became an international star in 2001 with “Get Ur Freak On.” Over a bhangra-style beat that sounds at once exotic and erotic, Elliott works in witty, often hilarious, rhymes informed by equal parts feminism and freakiness; sending the single to the top 10 in the U.S. and U.K., with it also charting in numerous other countries.\n\n‘Crazy in Love’ (2003) by Beyoncé\n\nAlready famous for Destiny’s Child, Beyoncé cemented her superstar status by executive producing and co-writing most of the material for her 2003 solo debut “Dangerously in Love,” including the lead single/first track “Crazy in Love” that became one the year’s top hits. An effervescent love song, featuring an intro and cameo by then-boyfriend Jay-Z, “Crazy in Love” deftly melds pop, R&B and hip-hop with Beyoncé’s expressive vocals front and center.\n\n‘No One’ (2007) by Alicia Keys\n\n“No One” finds pianist Alicia Keys at the top of her game as singer, songwriter and co-producer with the 2007 song staying at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for five straight weeks. Keys would later explain, during a recording of “VH1 Storytellers,” that she wrote “No One” as an afterthought while completing her “As I Am” album on which it appears. She says that the song, one of the most beautiful love songs of all time, just came to her, and that she doesn’t know from where the song came. “It’s a rare occasion that this happens,” she says. Yes indeed.\n\n‘Super Bass’ (2011) by Nicki Minaj\n\nRapper and singer Nicki Minaj’s distinctive vocal stylings, often incorporating various accents from both sides of the Atlantic, finally went mainstream in 2010 with the release of her debut album “Pink Friday” and its multitude of hit singles. None, though, were quite as impactful as the fifth single, the electronic-informed “Super Bass” that Minaj co-wrote about the thrills of flirting on her own terms. The song became an international smash with Minaj’s historic run of hits continuing right into 2020 with the No. 1 singles “Say So” and “Trollz.”\n\n‘We Found Love’ (2011) by Rihanna featuring Calvin Harris\n\nPossessing a warmly textured voice with a light West Indian lilt, Rihanna hit new pop highs with her sixth studio album “Talk That Talk,” which she executive produced. Strong throughout, the album’s lead single “We Found Love,” featuring Scottish DJ Calvin Harris’ thumping electro house and a blast of old school techno, gives Rihanna the perfect platform to sell the world on her vision of finding “love in a hopeless place.”\n\n‘Truth Hurts’ (2017) by Lizzo\n\nThe most electrifying entertainer of 2019, Lizzo arrived on the scene with her rock-solid third studio album “Cuz I Love You” boasting a pair of hits – “Juice” and “Tempo” featuring Missy Elliott – that sounded smarter, fresher and often wickedly funnier than anything else released that year. But singer, rapper, songwriter and flutist Lizzo had an even bigger smash tucked away. After going viral via TikTok and being heard in the Netflix movie “Someone Great,” Lizzo’s wildly catchy and clever “Truth Hurts,” originally released in 2017, became her first No. 1 hit in 2019.\n\n‘WAP’ (2020) by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion\n\nThe NSFW anthem of 2020, “WAP” features some of the raunchiest, most detailed and quotable lyrics of any hip-hop song ever recorded. A sex-positive masterstroke, albeit not for all tastes (its full title can't be repeated here), the song's rapper/lyricists deliver one supercharged sexual innuendo after another over sledgehammer bass and little else, their rhymes front and center: “I don’t cook, I don’t clean, but let me tell you how I got this ring.”\n\nSeptember in music:Machine Gun Kelly album, Public Enemy is back and new Carrie Underwood\n\nThe 500 greatest albums of all time:Beach Boys, The Beatles, Beyoncé top Rolling Stone's new list", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/02/10/rihanna-best-songs-ever-ranked/11223998002/", "title": "Rihanna's 20 best songs ranked ahead of Super Bowl 57 halftime ...", "text": "What does Rihanna plan on singing at the 2023 Super Bowl?\n\nThat's the question with Rihanna set to take the world's biggest stage as the star of Sunday's halftime show at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nShe may not be The Only Pop Star (In the World), but it could be argued that she’s had as big an impact on pop radio this century as any artist in the running, having topped the Billboard Hot 100 14 times with hits ranging from “SOS” to “Work,\" at which point she became the youngest artist in chart history to land that many songs at No. 1.\n\nWe haven't heard much from Rihanna lately, but that's all about to change after the first half of the big game.\n\nAnd that makes this as good a time as any for a countdown of her greatest singles – not the biggest but the best songs that have made her such a huge pop icon.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\n20. 'Rehab' (2008)\n\nJustin Timberlake wrote this double-platinum hit with his producers and supplies guest vocals. But Rihanna’s wounded vocal holds the spotlight on this melancholy ballad, comparing her feelings for a lover to addiction. When they first meet, she’s never felt something so strong. When he leaves, she feels empty and hollow. “It's like you were my favorite drug,” she sings. “The only problem is that you was using me in a different way that I was using you / But now that I know it’s not meant to be / You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you.” The production is a richly textured gem, making excellent use of acoustic guitar and gloomy strings. The only downside? Timberlake’s guest vocal, which adds nothing and is way too prominently featured in the mix.\n\n19. 'Where Have You Been' (2012)\n\nIt opens on a sly interpolation of the Geoff Mack country standard \"I've Been Everywhere,\" a song that truly has been everywhere, to the extent that when a version done by Johnny Cash in 1996 resurfaced in a U.S. Postal Service ad last year, a lot of listeners may have been surprised to hear him \"covering\" Rihanna. Not that anything about this track feels even slightly country. It's a dancefloor-packing banger with a thumping house beat and an urgent vocal from RiRi, who's been everywhere, man, looking for someone. It topped the Billboard dance charts and won best dance performance (deservedly so) at the Soul Train Awards.\n\n18. 'Needed Me' (2016)\n\nThis anti-romantic anthem is one of the edgier moments on her latest album, musically and lyrically. The production is dark and futuristic, slinking along at an ominous crawl as Rihanna brushes off a lover with an attitude that would destroy most men on the receiving end. “I was good on my own,” she begins. “That’s the way it was / You was good on the low for a faded (expletive) / on some faded love.” She doesn’t need his white horse or his carriage. She got what she wanted, and now it’s time for him to get his own damn cab ride home.\n\n17. 'Don't Stop the Music' (2007)\n\nMichael Jackson earned a writing credit for the sampling of \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-koosa,\" a hook the Gloved One borrowed from Manu Dibango’s “Soul Makossa” to put the thrill in the \"Thriller\" hit \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\" But it's more about the near-euphoric throbbing of that club beat as Rihanna effortlessly lives up to the disco-friendly promise of that title, pleading \"Please don't stop the music\" on the chorus of an ode to finding new love on the dancefloor as contagious as Madonna in her prime. It topped the dance charts for obvious reasons and became a massive global smash.\n\n16. 'Diamonds' (2012)\n\nA brooding ballad driven by a nagging dance beat, RiRi's 12th chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100 was written by Sia in collaboration with the song's producers, Benny Blanco and Stargate. You may tempted, in fact, to believe that's actually Sia repeating \"Shine bright like a diamond\" but that's just Rihanna doing all she can to channel what she liked about the character in Sia's vocal on the demo. The rest of the vocal is pure Rihanna, impassioned and soulful and fully committed to making the audience want to see themselves in the single's empowering lyrics.\n\n15. 'Bitch Better Have My Money' (2015)\n\nThis platinum single peaked at No. 15, which is higher than most murder ballads were charting in 2015. It’s on the darker side of the Rihanna spectrum and yet she sounds completely natural delivering threats with the off-handed shrug of a professional. Is it dark and disturbing? Yes. But that’s what makes it work, work, work, work, work, work. The production is suitably creepy. And that definitely adds to the appeal. But the casual swagger of Rihanna’s vocal is what ultimately seals the deal here.\n\n14. 'FourFiveSeconds' (2015)\n\nYou may have seen the power trio of Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney do this on the Grammys. And by power trio, I mean a trio of powerful figures, including an actual Beatle (still bigger than Yeezus). McCartney's contributions here are kept to strumming an acoustic guitar and possibly contributing some harmony. The lead vocals are shared by Rihanna, who brings soulful grit to the proceeding after starting the song with an endearing squeak, and West, who brings requisite swagger to slang-heavy lyrics that are, frankly, on the hit-or-miss side. 'Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz?!' The good news is the hook is undeniable enough to make the weaker lines worthwhile.\n\n13. 'Take a Bow' (2008)\n\nIt could be argued that this single is Rihanna at her schmaltziest. And you would win that argument. But here’s the thing. The vocal plays to all her soulful strengths. And the lyrics are occasionally kind of funny, which offsets the schmaltz. Take the opening verse: “You look so dumb right now / Standing outside my house.” And the second verse is genius: “Grab your clothes and get gone / You better hurry up / Before the sprinklers come on.” This song became her third chart-topping entry on the Hot 100, going on to be certified quadruple-platinum.\n\n12. 'Stay' (2013)\n\nThis ballad stalled at No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100, but that didn’t stop it from finishing 13th on the year-end Hot 100. It starts as a piano ballad with an aching vocal from Rihanna and never kicks in like you half-expect it to the first time through, not even after Mikky Ekko makes his entrance. The best part is the two voices coming together on “Funny you’re the broken one but I’m the only one who needed saving / ’Cause when you never see the light it’s hard to know which one of us is caving.”\n\n11. 'SOS' (2006)\n\nHer first chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100 samples Soft Cell’s New Wave reinvention of the old Ed Cobb song “Tainted Love” to glorious effect. She even paraphrases a few of the lyrics, pouting “You got me tossin’ and turnin’ / Can’t sleep at night.” The first single released from “A Girl Like Me,” the singer’s second album, it spent three weeks at No. 1 on its way to going double-platinum. The New Wave vibe is undeniable, and yet it topped the dance charts. In 2006.\n\n10. 'Disturbia' (2008)\n\nIt's kind of weird that this would be the follow-up to the piano-driven lite-soul balladry of “Take a Bow.” But this song fits her outfits better with its throbbing club beat and electronic handclaps while her voice is filtered through some of the quirkiest Auto-Tune sorcery since Cher asked us whether or not we believe in a life after love for an overall effect that effortlessly picks up on the New Wave vibe of \"SOS.\" Best line: \"bum bum de-dum bum bum de-dum bum.\"\n\n9. 'Kiss It Better' (2016)\n\nThere are obvious echoes of Prince’s glory days informing nearly every aspect of this soulful slow jam, from the tone on that guitar lick that opens the record to the vocal blend on the “What are you willing to do?” part. It’s a moody track, with Rihanna convincing her ex to “kiss it better,” brushing off the complications with “Who cares when it feels like crack?” and overruling his objections with “Man, (expletive) yo pride / Just take it on back, boy, take it on back.” This \"Anti\" single didn't do much on the pop charts but it should have.\n\n8. 'Rude Boy' (2010)\n\nIs this a song about Rihanna having fallen for a ska fan? Or is there some other kind of rude boy? There is a certain dancehall vibe at work here, but I'm pretty sure she means a less specific kind of rude boy, one who might respond well to her sexual advances, which range from taunts of \"Is you big enough?\" to promises of \"I'm-a let you be the captain.\" Christina Aguilera may have dressed more like a dominatrix in 2010, but no one asserted her sexual dominance with more success than Rihanna on this track, the 16th-biggest single on the year-end Hot 100.\n\n7. 'Work' (2016)\n\nA moody dancehall-flavored ballad with a minimalist approach to constructing a groove, making excellent use of empty space, this global smash features Drake as the sensitive lothario he plays so well. “If you had a twin, I would still choose you,” he tells her. “I don’t wanna rush into it, if it’s too soon / But I know you know you need to get done, done, done, done.” And by done, he means exactly what you think he means. The emotional investment here is all Rihanna, and she nails it.\n\n6. 'Pon de Replay' (2005)\n\nThis dancehall pop hit was Rihanna’s first single, and that beat, a thumping precursor to “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” is undeniable. So is the chorus hook, in which Rihanna pleads with Mr. DJ, “Won’t you turn the music up?” The title is apparently Bajan Creole for “play it again.” The single peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100, going double platinum.\n\n5. 'Only Girl (In the World)' (2010)\n\nThis synth-driven Europop club banger was named best dance recording at the Grammys for a reason. By the time that thumping dance beat kicks in on the chorus hook, if you’re not dancing, that just means you don’t like dancing. A six-times-platinum smash, it topped the Hot 100 and the Billboard dance charts. And that hard-hitting dance beat is topped by an impassioned vocal, Rihanna demanding, “Want you to make me feel like I’m the only girl in the world / Like I’m the only one that you’ll ever love / Like I’m the only one who knows your heart.”\n\n4. 'Umbrella' (2007)\n\nFor romance in the club, you'd be hard pressed to top \"Umbrella,\" a promise to be there on a rainy day with her trusty umbrella to make it all better for you. In one of the catchier choruses to top the charts this century, she tells him, \"When the sun shines, we'll shine together / Told you I'll be here forever / Said I'll always be a friend / Took an oath I'm-a stick it out till the end / Now that it's raining more than ever, know that we'll still have each other / You can stand under my umbrella.\" After filling the summer with thoughts of downpours, it finished second on the year-end Hot 100, right behind Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable.\"\n\n3. 'We Found Love' (2011)\n\nRihanna sounds good in the club. This nine-times-platinum electro triumph is her biggest-selling single ever, spending 10 weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100. It was written and produced by Calvin Harris, who pushes the beat here with an urgency that’s less aggressive than what the producers behind “Only Girl (In the World)\" would have done. That ascending synth coming out of the opening chorus is a stroke of genius, “A Day in the Life” for the dance floor. And Rihanna’s vocal is flawless, from the time she makes her entrance, her dreamy delivery juxtaposed against a driving synth hook, to her wistful phrasing on “The way I’m feeling I just can’t deny but I’ve gotta let it go.”\n\n2. 'S&M' (2011)\n\nSome people found this shocking. What's shocking is how long it took Rihanna to realize that she hadn't done a song called \"S&M\" yet. Is it kinky by the numbers? Sure. She seemingly couldn't come up with a line more quintessentially Rihanna than \"I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it.\" But then she turned around and followed through with \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me.\" A remix starring Britney Spears spent one extremely kinky week at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\n1. 'Love on the Brain' (2016)\n\nThis soulful throwback to the sort of ballad Otis Redding might have done, complete with Hammond B3 organ and doo-wop-flavored backing vocals, somehow topped the Billboard dance charts on its way to going six times platinum. It doesn’t feel like the sort of song that would become Rihanna's 22nd top five entry on the Billboard Hot 100. But it does feel timeless. And timeless may even be better than topping the charts with a song that feels completely of the moment. Her delivery could not feel more wounded and it really shows you what she has to offer as a vocalist.\n\nGet ready for Super Bowl 57:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/09/13/senorita-songwriter-charli-xcx-talks-new-album-battling-anxiety/2284540001/", "title": "\"Senorita\" songwriter Charli XCX talks new album, battling anxiety", "text": "Charli XCX is here to save pop music.\n\nSince riding in on a wave of woozy, throbbing synths on breakthrough singles \"Nuclear Seasons\" and \"You're the One\" in 2012, the British singer-songwriter (real name Charlotte Aitchison) has redefined what it means to be a pop artist in the 21st century.\n\nShe flirted with mainstream ubiquity in 2014 with the one-two punch of Top 10 hits \"Boom Clap\" and Iggy Azalea's \"Fancy,\" on which she's featured.

Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nQuestion: It's been nearly five years since you released a formal album. Why now?\n\nAnswer: It just feels like the right time. The two mixtapes I did really strongly connected me to my fans. As soon as I started doing exactly what was in my brain and not worrying about commercial success, my fan base – who had always been there but were maybe waiting for me to be totally true to myself – really began to understand me and become involved in everything. So I just finally felt like there were people who actually wanted an album.\n\nQ: Was there anything you found most stressful or frustrating about the rollout of \"Sucker\" that you wanted to avoid this time around?\n\nA: I don't really remember the rollout of \"Sucker.\" It's more that I've just really grown as an artist but also as a person. I think it's understanding the power of saying no and doing exactly what I want. In that time, I've learned this great skill of making people feel like I'm compromising without actually compromising. (Laughs.)\n\nQ: \"Gone\" is easily one of my favorite songs of the year. You've talked about how you and Christine and the Queens wanted to collaborate and immediately clicked, but what inspired the song itself?\n\nA: It was inspired by a conversation we were having about that feeling everybody gets where you feel really alone, even if you're in a room full of people. It's about not belonging and feeling uncomfortable, like you're not \"worthy\" to be in a space. I'm quite an emotionally volatile person. Some days I feel super cocky and confident, and others I feel so low. So it's about that feeling when you're in the depths of anxiety and isolation.\n\nQ: You've been candid on social media about perceived success in the music industry and not being sure where exactly you fit in. Why is it important for you to share those feelings with your fans and fellow artists?\n\nA: Whenever I'm in an emotional moment, I'm not really thinking, \"Oh, I should post this.\" Sometimes after I post stuff, I'm like, \"I shouldn't have done that,\" but other times, I'm like, \"You know what? People can relate to this.\" I get a lot of responses from artists who feel the same way but maybe they don't talk about it. It's a scary thing to admit that you feel vulnerable, but it's also very human. Nobody is perfect all the time, and it's an exhausting image to keep up.\n\nQ: Have you ever considered solely being a songwriter, or do you always need to have that outlet as a performer?\n\nA: I think about it all the time. The reason I find it really hard is the space I'm in is quite unique. I do sort of straddle pop and underground quite well, and on my good days, it feels really exciting, like, \"Great! I'm in this space, no one else is in it, and it's cool.\" But other days, it's really confusing, and I feel a bit lost, like, \"Ah, who am I?\" There's no role to really define me, because I'm not this huge pop star, I'm not truly underground and I'm not just a songwriter – I'm kind of everything, and when I'm at my most low, it puts me in this weird headspace. But after I go through it all, I think I couldn't just be a songwriter. I think I'd get a little bored because there are so many different outlets of my creativity that I need to utilize. I could do it for two months, and then I'd be like, \"I gotta be onstage!\"\n\nQ: It seems like there's a changing of the guard happening in pop right now, where even massive stars like Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift have struggled on the charts this year. How do you feel about the state of the genre?\n\nA: It's a really interesting time. I think some bigger artists are less concerned about charts. Miley is someone who's being really true to what she wants to do – she doesn't care about numbers and just wants to make the art she wants to make. But there's always an expectation on a specific person, like what they're \"supposed\" to be doing, and it's hard when you've been in the industry for a long time to change the perspective people have on you. But it's nice that pop is so broad at the moment. There are so many interesting artists making huge songs that five years ago, might not have been on the radio. There are also so many huge artists collaborating. Like that Miley, Ariana (Grande) and Lana (Del Rey) song (\"Don't Call Me Angel\")? That's going to be amazing, I'm dying.\n\nQ: Lizzo is featured on the album on \"Blame It On Your Love.\" How'd it feel to see her finally hit No. 1 with \"Truth Hurts?\"\n\nA: Oh, my God. To see her be No. 1 is so great. Lizzo has been doing her thing for a really long time, and she's had the same message and same energy and same amazing songs, and now it's the most global, massive thing ever. People are just ready for that realness. And I think in the past, pop hasn't been that honest – it's been very put-together and orchestrated, but I feel like that's happening less and less and less, because people just want authenticity.\n\nMore: Lizzo, the flute-playing singer, is back in the studio with a 'really different' sound", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/23/weeknd-named-worlds-most-popular-artist-guinness-records/11530000002/", "title": "The Weeknd named world's most popular artist by Guinness World ...", "text": "The Weeknd is on top of the world.\n\nThe artist, born Abel Tesfaye, has become the most popular artist across the globe, according to Guinness World Records, which dubbed the \"Can't Feel My Face\" singer king of streams Monday.\n\nThe announcement was tied to two world records broken by the 33-year-old based on Spotify data.\n\nThe Canadian artist had the most monthly listeners on Spotify grabbing the attention of 111.4 million users as of Monday and he was also the first artist to have 100 million monthly listeners on the platform.\n\nMiley Cyrus followed with 82.4 million monthly listeners.\n\nNeed a break?

For this list, a “Hoosier” is defined as someone who helped shape the cultural identity of Indiana or someone whose identity was shaped by the state.\n\nHere’s who made the cut, from No. 25 to No. 1, including YouTube and Spotify playlists:\n\n25. Rusty Redenbacher, inventive voice of Mudkids and Birdmen\n\nIndiana has yet to send a hip-hop act to the top of the charts, but you shouldn’t believe the state lacks a transcendent MC. Rusty Redenbacher, born in Gary in 1970, has a catalog of razor-sharp rhymes stretching across four Mudkids albums with producer/DJ Tyler Knapp, three solo albums and a duo album with Mr. Kinetik. Redenbacher’s songs brim with drama, comedy, romance, intelligence, pride, humility, perseverance, celebration and gratitude. Before the Mudkids, he blazed a trail through Indiana’s hard-rock scene as frontman for Birdmen of Alcatraz.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nEssential songs: \"MK Hustle,” “Another Journey,\" “Cashin’ In.”\n\nHe said it: \"Lyrically, man, I’m always pushing the envelope. I’m John Glenn. I’ve been to space and I’m trying to go back,\" Redenbacher told IndyStar in 1998.\n\n24. Shannon Hoon, Blind Melon singer and MTV fixture in the ’90s\n\nAfter earning nine varsity letters at Lafayette's McCutcheon High School, Shannon Hoon left Indiana to pursue his rock 'n' roll dream in Los Angeles. Fellow Hoosier Axl Rose provided an assist by inviting Hoon to sing backing vocals on Guns N' Roses songs and even appear in the video for 1991 single \"Don't Cry.\" Hoon's own band, Blind Melon, took MTV by storm one year later with its \"No Rain\" single and memorable \"Bee Girl\" video mascot. Blind Melon sold more than 2 million copies of its debut album, appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and performed as part of the 1994 Woodstock festival. Hoon (1967-1995) died two months after the release of Blind Melon's second album, \"Soup.\" An accidental drug overdose was the cause of Hoon's death.\n\nEssential songs: \"No Rain,” “Tones of Home,\" “Three is a Magic Number.”\n\nHe said it: \"I was never satisfied,\" Hoon told IndyStar in 1995, \"but that wasn't a bad thing for me. I want to do more. I'm never satisfied with what I've done.\"\n\n23. Bob Flanigan, head of the class for Four Freshmen harmonies\n\nFormed on the campus of Butler University in 1948, the Four Freshmen sang vocal harmonies that defied the rules of math. Bob Flanigan (who grew up in Greencastle), brothers Don and Ross Barbour (Columbus, Ind.) and Hal Kratzsch (Warsaw) spread four voices across what seemed to be five- or six-part harmony. Ross coined the term “purple chords” to describe their lush-sounding arrangements, and Flanigan (1926-2011) sang lead atop the shifting stack of sound. Credited by Brian Wilson as a prime influence on the Beach Boys, the Four Freshmen were Inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2001.\n\nEssential songs: “It’s a Blue World,” “Poinciana,” “Their Hearts Were Full of Spring.”\n\nHe said it: “We think like horn players. The way we blend is due to our approach as instrumentalists,” Flanigan told The Los Angeles Times in 1991.\n\n22. The Rev. Josh Peyton, modern guitar hero of timeless country blues\n\nIt wasn't long after Josh Peyton graduated from Westfield High School in 1999 that he began to spread the country-blues gospel popularized by Charley Patton and Furry Lewis in the 1920s. As leader of the Rev. Peyton's Big Damn Band (featuring his wife, Breezy, on washboard and Maxwell Senteney on drums), Peyton has performed in 32 countries and every state aside from Alaska and Hawaii. Audiences are wowed when he multi-tasks melodies and bass lines on his resonator guitar. Peyton also made a 2016 video featuring his “guitgun” — a three-string guitar that's also an operational shotgun — that's racked up more than 25 million online views.\n\nEssential songs: \"Clap Your Hands,” “We Deserve a Happy Ending,\" “Two Bottles of Wine.”\n\nHe said it: \"If they played music in Claire's at the mall instead of in bars, I'd go to Claire's at the mall,\" Peyton told IndyStar in 2017. \"I'd suck it up, carry my guitar down there and play. I love making music. I love everything about it.\"\n\n21. Dale Lawrence, boundary pusher with Gizmos and Boatmen\n\nDale Lawrence supplied the rootsy jangle when two underground styles — punk and indie rock — surfaced in Indiana. The singer-songwriter played in the second version of the state's first punk band, the Gizmos, and he's led the Vulgar Boatmen through multiple decades of critical acclaim. When the Gizmos made a split album with the West Lafayette-based Dow Jones and the Industrials (a 1980 gem titled \"Hoosier Hysteria\"), Lawrence served as primary vocalist and songwriter. The Boatmen specialize in clean, refined pop-rock — skittering along a rhythmic path established by Bo Diddley and later subverted by the Velvet Underground.\n\nEssential songs: \"Change the World All Around,\" \"Mary Jane,\" \"The Midwest can be Alright.\"\n\nHe said it: \"In New York, we got lost in the shuffle and we felt that we were just playing in a void. In Bloomington, at least people disliked us,\" said Lawrence, telling IndyStar about the Gizmos in a 2000 interview.\n\n20. Scrapper Blackwell, collaborative and influential blues master\n\nThe story of blues music doesn’t begin with Robert Johnson, the mysterious 1930s singer-guitarist from Mississippi who captured the imaginations of Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin. Johnson borrowed the framework for two of his signature tunes — “Sweet Home Chicago” and “Kindhearted Woman Blues” — from Indianapolis-based musicians Francis “Scrapper” Blackwell and Leroy Carr. Vocalist-pianist Carr and guitarist Blackwell recorded more than 160 songs together between 1928 and 1935. Blackwell Carr Memorial Playground, part of Brookside Park, is named in honor of Blackwell (1903-1962) and Carr (1905-1935).\n\nEssential songs: “Kokomo Blues,” “How Long, How Long Blues,” “Nobody Knows You When You’re Down and Out.”\n\nHe said it: “The records sold so fast that the company couldn’t keep them, that’s the truth,” Blackwell on 1928 recording “How Long, How Long Blues,” as told to Jazz Monthly magazine in 1960.\n\n19. Crystal Gayle, ‘Brown Eyes’ singer who became a crossover queen\n\nCrystal Gayle recorded one of the biggest country-pop crossover hits of the 1970s as well as 31 more songs that reached the Top 10 of Billboard magazine's country chart. Born near Van Lear, Ky., in 1951, Brenda Gail Webb was the youngest child of coal miner Melvin \"Ted\" Webb and Clara Marie Ramey Webb. One of Brenda's seven siblings, Loretta, found country music fame after she married Oliver \"Mooney\" Lynn. Brenda's parents moved to Wabash in the mid-1950s, and she adopted the stage name Crystal Gayle before releasing debut single \"I've Cried (the Blue Right Out of My Eyes)\" in 1970. Seven years later, \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" made Gayle a mainstream star.\n\nEssential songs: \"Don’t It Make My Brown Eyes Blue,” “I’ll Get Over You,\" “You and I.”\n\nShe said it: \"On the weekends, I was always out there in whatever clubs I could get into, the VFWs. I'd get up there with my brother's band and sing a few songs,\" said Gayle about early performances in Indiana, as told to The Indianapolis News in 1993.\n\n18. Charlie Fuqua, responsible for signature riffs on Ink Spots hits\n\nMost hit songs by the Ink Spots began the same way: in the hands of guitarist Charlie Fuqua. “If I Didn’t Care,” “My Prayer,” “Maybe,” “Do I Worry?” and “I Don’t Want to Set the World On Fire” are difficult to tell apart in their opening moments, because Fuqua applied his signature “bom-ba-dee-da, bom-ba-dee-da” intro to all. The formula worked. The Ink Spots, founded in Indianapolis in 1934, sent 20 songs into the Top 10 of Billboard magazine’s Hit Parade between 1939 and 1949. The original Ink Spots were Fuqua (1910-1970), Jerry Daniels (1915-1995), Ivory “Deek” Watson (1909-1969) and Orville “Hoppy” Jones (1902-1944). In 1989, the Ink Spots became Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees in the category of “Early Influence.”\n\nEssential songs: \"If I Didn’t Care,” “My Prayer,\" “I Don’t Want to Set the World On Fire.”\n\nHe said it: “The act was known as King Jack and the Jesters and included Deek Watson, Orville 'Hoppy' Jones, Jerry Daniels and myself. Upon arriving in New York, the group, sitting in Moe Gale's office, tried to figure out a new name for the group. All of a sudden a drop of ink spilled from Moe Gale's fountain pen, and Deek Watson snapped his fingers and said, 'That's it. The Ink Spots,' \" Fuqua, recalling the group's origins for The Carolina Times in 1952.\n\n17. Steve Wariner, one of Music City’s few ‘Certified Guitar Players’\n\nSteve Wariner isn’t the flashiest guitar player in Nashville, but he’s recognized as one of the best. Born in Noblesville on Christmas Day, 1954, Wariner is one of just five people to be designated as “Certified Guitar Players” by country music icon Chet Atkins (1924-2001). Atkins gave the title to himself, Wariner, Jerry Reed, Tommy Emmanuel and John Knowles. Wariner’s career highlights include four Grammy Awards, more than 30 Top 10 country hits as a performer and three Top 5 country hits in the role of songwriter for other artists. Wariner’s 1998 hit “Holes in the Floor of Heaven” collected Single of the Year and Song of the Year honors at the Country Music Association Awards.\n\nEssential songs: \"Holes in the Floor of Heaven,” “Lonely Women Make Good Lovers,” “If I Didn’t Love You.”\n\nHe said it: \"I remember when I was living in a town called Noblesville. I remember driving around listening to country music on WIRE radio. I'd pull up at a red light and all my friends would be in the next car and there'd be some girls over there. I'd either roll my window up or real quick turn the radio off. I was embarrassed that they might think I was listening to country music. But it's not that way anymore,\" Wariner, in a 1991 IndyStar interview.\n\n16. Yank Rachell, mandolin ace and patriarch of Indianapolis blues\n\nJames “Yank” Rachell lived a low-key life in Indianapolis when the folk music revival exploded in the early 1960s. People wanted to hear the man who played mandolin on 30-year-old country blues recordings, and Tennessee native Rachell was newly widowed and available for gigs. \"I didn't have nothing else to do,” Rachell told The Indianapolis Star in 1997. “I went on, me and Sleepy John (Estes) and Hammie Nixon.\" The trio played the festival circuit in the United States and Europe, waking up the echoes of “Diving Duck Blues” (recorded in Memphis, Tenn., in 1929) and “New Minglewood Blues” (recorded in Memphis in 1930 and frequently covered by the Grateful Dead). To Indianapolis-based musicians, Rachell (1910-1997) was the long-running patriarch of the local blues community. He made “Pig Trader’s Blues,” a 1995 album recorded with guitarist David Morgan, and “Too Hot for the Devil,” a 1997 album recorded with guitarist Pat Webb and harmonica player Allen Stratyner.\n\nEssential songs: \"She Caught the Katy,\" \"Diving Duck Blues\" \"New Minglewood Blues.\"\n\nHe said it: “You’ve got to have that feeling to play the blues,” Yachell told IndyStar in 1992. “Sometimes it makes me cry, I feel so good.”\n\nIndyStar podcast:Revisit chats with Dave Grohl, Slash, David Lee Roth and more\n\nMusic festival:See-it, feel-it party planned for Fountain Square\n\nConcert recap:U2 spotlights best of U.S.A., Indy in stadium show\n\n15. Paul Mahern, Zero Boys trailblazer and production wizard\n\nThe Zero Boys' \"Vicious Circle\" album was made Aug. 18-19, 1981, at Keystone Recording in Indianapolis. At age 17, Paul Mahern accomplished enough during those two days to earn his spot on a list of top Hoosier musicians. \"Vicious Circle\" is a breakneck document of American punk rock, fueled by Mahern's youthful energy and the adept musicianship of Zero Boys' band mates guitarist Terry \"Hollywood\" Howe, bass player David \"Tufty\" Clough and drummer Mark Cutsinger. Mahern's adult life has been filled with more time spent in studios, as he's worked as producer or engineer on recordings by Iggy Pop, John Mellencamp, the Blake Babies, the Rev. Peyton's Big Damn Band and many more.\n\nEssential songs: \"Civilization's Dying,\" \"Livin' in the '80s,\" \"Dirty Alleys, Dirty Minds.”\n\nHe said it: “In reality, my life hasn't changed that much. I'm still completely surrounded by music and do exactly what I want to do,\" Mahern told IndyStar in 2012.\n\n14. Kenny Aronoff, in-demand drummer with star-studded discography\n\nKenny Aronoff’s name is listed in the liner notes of hundreds of albums, and he’s seated at a drum kit for some of the world’s biggest gigs. In 2009, Aronoff backed an A-list lineup at President Obama’s inauguration celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. Aronoff, who grew up in Massachusetts and studied music at Indiana University, played drums during 2014's \"The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles.\" Seventeen years of work in John Mellencamp’s band cemented Aronoff’s reputation as a powerhouse drummer, and tours with Melissa Etheridge, Bob Seger, Fogerty, Joe Cocker, the BoDeans, Smashing Pumpkins and Chickenfoot followed.\n\nEssential songs: John Mellencamp’s “Crumblin’ Down,” the BoDeans’ “You Don’t Get Much,” Hollywood hit “That Thing You Do!”\n\nHe said it: “Music makes me feel good. It's a physical thing, it's a mental thing, it's a spiritual thing. Those are the big three. That's what makes a complete person. To be able to play music every day — and get paid for it — the question isn't why do you do it. Why not? You'd be a fool not to,” Aronoff, to IndyStar in 1992.\n\n13. Joshua Bell, violin sensation and Indiana Living Legend\n\nThe star power of Joshua Bell, who emerged as a violin sensation at age 14, has yet to burn out or fade. Born in Bloomington, in 1967, Bell is a Grammy Award winner who collected Indiana Living Legend honors from the Indiana Historical Society in 2000. He studied under Indiana University professor Josef Gingold and earned an artist diploma in violin performance in 1989 — the same year Bell made his debut on “The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.” Bell’s mainstream appeal translated into a 2002 appearance on “Sesame Street,” a 2000 spotlight in People magazine’ ”50 Most Beautiful People” issue and a 2010 PBS special in which Bell’s guest stars included Regina Spektor, Sting, Kristin Chenoweth and fellow IU alum Chris Botti.\n\nEssential songs: “Excerpt from ‘West Side Story Suite,’ ” \"Rondeau (Tempo di minuetto),\" \"Allegro ben ritmato e Deciso.\"\n\nHe said it: “These days, getting a wider audience is really important, with orchestras folding right and left. I'm not trying to popularize the music I play in the way I play it; I just try to open people to it,\" Bell, to IndyStar in 1993.\n\n12. Janet Jackson, pop superstar who maintained ‘Control’\n\nJanet was the ninth and final child in the musically mighty Jackson family, born after Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, La Toya, Marlon, Michael and Randy. By embracing reinvention within dance, pop and R&B styles, Janet’s career eclipsed all but Michael’s. Born in Gary in 1966, Janet Jackson has sold more than 100 million recordings. Her first two albums flopped, but a commercial breakthrough arrived with “Control,” her 1986 statement of independence that yielded five Top 5 singles: “What Have You Done for Me Lately,” “Nasty,” “When I Think of You,” “Control” and “Let’s Wait Awhile.” Jackson’s next four albums — \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" (1989), \"Janet\" (1993), \"The Velvet Rope\" (1997) and \"All for You\" (2001) — stretched her impact era into the 21st century.\n\nEssential songs: “Nasty,\" “When I Think of You,” “That’s the Way Love Goes.\"\n\nShe said it: “I wrote my very first song when I was 9. ‘Fantasy’ is the title. I remember being a kid and my brother Randy, my brother Mike and myself, we have our chores to do after dinner, especially, I remember one night in particular, I was doing dishes, I think Mike was sweeping the floor. And Randy was cleaning off the tables and all the countertops. And that's how we would always create music. We could come up with melodies and then we would add lyrics to them. And we would sing a three part-harmony,\" Jackson, on “Larry King Live” in 2010.\n\n11. J.J. Johnson, the unlimited innovator of jazz trombone\n\nJ.J. Johnson made the trombone a high-profile instrument in bebop jazz, giving it stature in context with Dizzy Gillespie’s trumpet and Charlie Parker’s saxophone. \"In those days the trombone was a slow instrument, but that didn't matter to J.J.,\" Indianapolis jazz great Jimmy Coe said following Johnson’s death in 2001. \"He opened a new field for trombonists. He was unlimited.\" Born in Indianapolis in 1924, James Louis Johnson (the “J.J.” nickname sprung from arrangements he initialed) attended Crispus Attucks High School. Johnson’s career highlights include popular collaborative albums made with Danish trombonist Kai Winding, playing on sessions that became Miles Davis’ “Birth of the Cool” album and being honored as an National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 1996. For 19 consecutive years, 1955-1973, Johnson was selected as top trombonist in annual Down Beat magazine reader polls.\n\nEssential songs: “Blue ‘n Boogie,” “It Never Entered My Mind,” “Lament.”\n\nHe said it: \"I've never been preoccupied with speed or technique or agility or any of the things that I'm accused of. I've been preoccupied — and consumed — by performing on the trombone with clarity, definition and logic,” Johnson, to IndyStar in 1995.\n\n10. John Hiatt, your favorite songwriter’s favorite songwriter\n\nArmed with sharp wit and a human touch, John Hiatt has written a mountain of songs popularized by himself and a laundry list of his peers. Bonnie Raitt made a hit of Hiatt’s “Thing Called Love”; Eric Clapton and B.B. King built a collaborative album around Hiatt’s “Riding with the King”; Buddy Guy mined extreme blues from Hiatt’s “Feels Like Rain”; and the Jeff Healey Band reached the Top 5 with Hiatt’s “Angel Eyes.” More than 30 acts covered “Have a Little Faith in Me,” a song that appeared on Hiatt’s “Bring the Family” — his 1987 album that provided a mainstream breakthrough following seven albums that were commercially ignored. Born in Indianapolis in 1952, Hiatt grew up near the intersection of 57th Street and Central Avenue. At 18, he left town for Nashville, Tenn. In 2008, Hiatt received the Americana Music Association’s lifetime achievement award for songwriting. He was inducted to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame the same year.\n\nEssential songs: “Have a Little Faith in Me,” “Drive South,” “Slow Turning.”\n\nHe said it: \"We used to get up a dozen people and ride around in this guy's hearse. We'd inevitably wind up Downtown with quarts of Boone's Farm apple wine wrapped in paper bags — sitting on the Circle or the War Memorial. Figuring it all out, so to speak, only to go back to our parents and realize we didn't have anything figured out,\" Hiatt in 1999, telling IndyStar about his teenage years.\n\n9. Freddie Hubbard, trumpet great who played with Coltrane and Hancock\n\nFrom bebop through the fusion era, trumpet/flugelhorn master Freddie Hubbard played jazz with a sense of daring and a knack for versatility. Hubbard, characterized as a “fiery individualist” by former IndyStar critic Jay Harvey, represented the next big thing in trumpet after the towering careers of Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. Across a 57-album career, Arsenal Tech High School alum Hubbard (1938-2008) made notable projects for Blue Note Records (including “Ready for Freddie” and “Hub-Tones” in the early 1960s) and CTI Records (including “Red Clay” and “First Light” in the early 1970s). As a supporting player, Hubbard appeared on landmark albums such as Herbie Hancock’s “Maiden Voyage,” John Coltrane’s “Ascension,” Eric Dolphy’s “Out to Lunch!” and Wayne Shorter’s “Speak No Evil.”\n\nEssential songs: “Red Clay,” “Arietis,” “Lament for Booker.\"\n\nHe said it: “I've played some things that I don't think too many cats can play that are alive today,\" Hubbard told the Associated Press in 2008. \"Whatever they play, it's not going to surpass that. You see, I played like a tenor saxophone, so a lot of the things with me are kind of different, kind of hard to play.”\n\n8. Axl Rose, Guns N’ Roses bad boy fueled by anti-Indiana sentiments\n\nAfter hitchhiking from Indiana to California, William B. Bailey adopted the stage name W. Axl Rose and sang in one of the most popular hard rock bands in history. Guns N’ Roses (featuring fellow Hoosier Izzy Stradlin on rhythm guitar) sold 30 million copies of 1987 album “Appetite for Destruction.” The album included songs based on Rose’s memories of authority figures in Indiana (“Out Ta Get Me”) and his perspective on big-city life (breakthrough single “Welcome to the Jungle”). Born in Lafayette in 1962, Rose dropped out of Jefferson High School. As an adolescent, he ran cross-country, sang in the choir and built a police record of minor offenses. Guns N’ Roses melded metal and punk styles to refreshingly jolt a rock scene dominated by hair bands.\n\nEssential songs: “Sweet Child o' Mine,” “Patience,” “November Rain.”\n\nHe said it: \"People that I used to go to school with, people that used to hate my guts, want me to invest money in this and that. People say (things) like ‘Axl thinks he's too cool to party with us.’ But those people never wanted to party with me before,” Rose, talking about Indiana to Rolling Stone magazine in 1989.\n\n7. Kenny ‘Babyface’ Edmonds, R&B heavyweight and 11-time Grammy winner\n\nIn the words of late IndyStar columnist Lynn Ford, Kenny “Babyface” Edmonds was a shy Northside nerd who grew up to be a world champ in pop and R&B. Edmonds has worked on more than 100 hit songs as a singer, songwriter or producer. His 1993 solo album “For the Cool in You” sold 3 million copies. His songwriting credits include Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road,” which spent a record-breaking 13 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard magazine’s Hot 100 chart in 1992. His production credits include Madonna’s “Take a Bow” and Whitney Houston’s “Exhale (Shoop Shoop).” In 1999, 17 miles of I-65 were named “Kenneth ‘Babyface’ Edmonds Highway” to honor the 11-time Grammy Award winner.\n\nEssential songs: “Whip Appeal,” “For the Cool in You,” “How Come, How Long.”\n\nHe said it: \"I call success having been lucky and having been blessed. But there are so many things that come with it: pressure, managers, contracts, record companies. There are battles all the way through — making sure you're making what you're supposed to make and getting what you're supposed to get. And trying to stay sane through it all,” Edmonds, to IndyStar in 1994.\n\n6. Hoagy Carmichael, composer of iconic ‘Stardust’ and ‘Georgia’ tunes\n\nHoagland Howard \"Hoagy\" Carmichael composed enduring tunes \"Stardust\" and \"Georgia (On My Mind).\" \"Stardust,\" written in Carmichael's hometown of Bloomington in 1927, has been recorded more than 1,500 times — making it one of the most popular songs of the 20th century. Pianist Carmichael recorded an instrumental version of \"Stardust\" at Gennett studios in Richmond, and Tin Pan Alley lyricist Mitchell Parish added words to the song in 1929. \"Georgia,\" written in 1930 by Carmichael with lyrics by fellow Hoosier Stuart.Gorrell, became a signature hit for Ray Charles in 1960. Carmichael (1899-1981) won an Academy Award in the category of best original song. \"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening\" appeared in 1951 film \"Here Comes the Groom.\"\n\nEssential songs: “Stardust,” “Georgia on My Mind,” “Baltimore Oriole.”\n\nHe said it: \"Jazz maniacs were being born and I was one of them. There were leaping legions of them from New Orleans to Chicago and Bloomington was right in the middle. Alleged to be in the exact center of population at that time and a part of the population was going jazz crazy,\" Carmichael wrote in his 1946 autobiography, \"The Stardust Road.\"\n\n5. John Mellencamp, ‘Small Town’ rock star who explores music’s roots\n\nAmong Indiana’s musicians, none has maintained a closer bond with the state than John Mellencamp. The no-nonsense yet good-timing rock star outlasted comparisons to Bruce Springsteen and Bob Seger to establish a respected career from his home base near Bloomington. Mellencamp, a 2008 inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, co-founded Farm Aid with Willie Nelson and Neil Young. Born in 1951 and initially saddled with a stage name of “Johnny Cougar” he didn’t want, the Seymour native became a fixture of MTV programming during the 1980s. His videos for “Hurts So Good,” “Jack & Diane,” “Crumblin’ Down,” “Pink Houses,” “Authority Song,” “Lonely Ol’ Night,” “Small Town,” “R.O.C.K. in the U.S.A.,” “Rain on the Scarecrow,” “Cherry Bomb,” “Paper in Fire” and “Check It Out” were aired in heavy rotation. The album \"American Fool\" (1982) sold 5 million copies. \"Uh-Huh\" (1983) followed with 3 million. \"Scarecrow\" (1985) hit 5 million, and \"The Lonesome Jubilee\" (1987) reached 3 million.\n\nEssential songs: “Paper in Fire,” “Minutes to Memories,” “Pink Houses.\"\n\nHe said it: \"Life is exhausting. To make it not exhausting, you have to continue to challenge yourself and try to do something that you never thought you could do. So many people think about me as 'Pink Houses' and 'Jack & Diane.' That's great. I'm very fortunate to have those songs. But I've written thousands of songs that aren't like that,\" Mellencamp told IndyStar in 2010.\n\n4. Bill Monroe, father of bluegrass who worked and played in Indiana\n\nThe father of bluegrass music wasn’t born in Indiana, but he embraced the state as hallowed ground. Monroe (1911-1996) spent significant time in Indiana during two phases of his career. As a teenager, he moved to industrial Lake County to find higher wages than were available in his hometown of Rosine, Ky. According to 2001 biography “Can’t You Hear Me Callin’,” written by Richard D. Smith, Monroe worked as a barrel loader and washer at the Sinclair Oil Refinery from 1930 to 1934. Away from the refinery, the Monroe Brothers (Charlie on vocals and guitar, Bill on mandolin and Birch on fiddle) played tunes at house parties and square dances in Hammond, Ind. Bill’s first radio appearances were broadcast from Hammond station WWAE and Gary’s WJKS. The dry-witted Monroe was widely quoted as saying, “Bluegrass is wonderful music. I’m glad I originated it.” Monroe lived in Indiana as a young man for reasons of self-preservation. He returned to make a mark in the state because he wanted to. In the early 1950s, Monroe purchased a 55-acre country music park in Brown County, within the unincorporated town of Bean Blossom and 5 miles north of Nashville. He presented his first bluegrass festival at the park, now known as the Bill Monroe Memorial Music Park and Campground, in 1967.\n\nEssential songs: “Uncle Pen,” “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” “New Mule Skinner Blues.\"\n\nHe said it: \"You know, I never wrote a tune in my life. All that music’s in the air around you all the time. I was just the first one to reach up and pull it out,” Monroe, quoted in The New York Times in 1994.\n\n3. Wes Montgomery, guitarist whose picking transformed jazz\n\nJohn Leslie “Wes” Montgomery transformed jazz guitar after World War II, playing a fingerpicking style initially embraced by the genre’s purists and later by the masses. Indianapolis native Montgomery was the innovator of a smooth, warm sound he coaxed by picking strings with the flesh of his thumb (instead of using a plastic or metal plectrum) and by doubling melodies via simultaneous “octave” notes. The two-time Grammy Award winner influenced the work of George Benson, Jimi Hendrix and Pat Metheny. In annual Down Beat magazine polls, Montgomery was selected as top guitarist five times in the 1960s by critics and four times by readers. Montgomery (1923-1968) took no formal training on guitar, but he cited Indianapolis-based pianist Erroll Grandy (1918-1991) as a mentor. Necessity proved to be the mother of invention for Montgomery’s distinctive style. In deference to his wife and neighbors, he turned down the volume on his amplifier during home rehearsal sessions and found he could hear his playing better by strumming strings with his thumb.\n\nEssential songs: “Four on Six,” “Jingles,” “West Coast Blues.\"\n\nHe said it: \"Working three gigs all that time was not the worst thing that could have happened to me. From all that scuffling, I learned a lot about discipline as an entertainer,\" Montgomery, telling Down Beat magazine in 1968 about six years in which he worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. in a radio parts factory, from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. playing music at the Turf Bar and from 2:30 to 5 a.m. playing music at the Missile Room.\n\n2. Cole Porter, Broadway genius who crafted enduring classics\n\nPeerless in style, sophistication and suggestive phrasing, Cole Porter ranks among the greatest songwriters of the 20th century. Born in Peru, Ind., in 1891, Porter composed music and lyrics for Broadway shows across 39 years — highlighted by \"Paris\" (1928), \"Anything Goes\" (1934) and \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (1948). Porter's songs, remarkably durable across generations, feature lyrics that are \"urbane or witty\" paired to melodies boasting a \"sinuous, brooding quality,\" as The Associated Press reported in his 1964 obituary. \"You're the Top,\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" \"Love for Sale,\" \"Night and Day,\" \"Begin the Beguine,\" \"I've Got You Under My Skin,\" \"Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love),\" \"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To\" and \"It's De-Lovely\" rank among Porter's immortal tunes. His maternal grandfather, J.O. Cole, amassed a fortune by selling supplies to miners during the California Gold Rush. He returned to Indiana to oversee Westleigh, the 750-acre estate in Miami County where Cole Porter grew up.\n\nEssential songs: “Anything Goes,” “You’re the Top,” “I Get a Kick Out of You.\"\n\nHe said it: \"I've been accused most of my life of being remote. But that's not so. I've been working. It's awful to tell people things like that. I've done lots of work at dinner, sitting between two bores. I can feign listening beautifully and work. That's the reason I like to go out. I have no hours. I can work anywhere. I work very well when I'm shaving or when I'm in a taxi,” Porter told The New York Times in 1955.\n\n1. Michael Jackson, ‘King of Pop’ for joyful dance hits and empathetic ballads\n\nA new era of superstars dawned when Michael Jackson sold more than 40 million copies of 1982 album \"Thriller.\" Gary native Jackson (1958-2009) earned his \"King of Pop\" nickname by making joy-infused dance hits and empathetic ballads. Within a career packed with honors, awards and superlatives, Jackson was named \"Most Successful Entertainer of All Time\" by the Guinness Book of World Records in 2006. \"Thriller\" was bookended by significant-selling albums \"Off the Wall\" (20 million copies in 1979) and \"Bad\" (30 million in 1987). In 1985, Jackson and Lionel Richie co-wrote landmark charity single \"We Are the World.\" Jackson's singing career began in Gary, where he spent his earliest years in a white house roughly the size of a two-car garage — 2300 Jackson St. Nine children of Joseph and Katherine Jackson lived in the house, and sons Michael, Tito, Marlon, Jackie and Jermaine became the dynamic Jackson 5 singing group. The quintet made its live debut at Gary nightclub Mr. Lucky's in 1964.\n\nEssential songs: “Billie Jean,” “I Want You Back,” “Man in the Mirror.\"\n\nHe said it: \"My motto has been ‘Heal the World,’ ‘We are the World,’ ‘Earth Song,’ ‘Save Our Children,’ ‘Help Our Planet.’ And people want to persecute me for it, but it never hurts, because the fan base becomes stronger. And the more you hit something hard, the more hardened it becomes — the stronger it becomes. And that’s what’s happened: I’m resilient. I have rhinoceros skin. Nothing can hurt me. Nothing,” Jackson, quoted in Interview magazine in 2003.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter David Lindquist at (317) 444-6404.

'Rehab' (2008)\n\nJustin Timberlake wrote this double-platinum hit with his producers and supplies guest vocals. But Rihanna’s wounded vocal holds the spotlight on this melancholy ballad, comparing her feelings for a lover to addiction. When they first meet, she’s never felt something so strong. When he leaves, she feels empty and hollow. “It's like you were my favorite drug,” she sings. “The only problem is that you was using me in a different way that I was using you / But now that I know it’s not meant to be / You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you.” The production is a richly textured gem, making excellent use of acoustic guitar and gloomy strings. The only downside? Timberlake’s guest vocal, which adds nothing and is way too prominently featured in the mix.\n\nConcert news:Beyoncé is bringing the Renaissance Tour to metro Phoenix. Here's how to get tickets\n\n19. 'Where Have You Been' (2012)\n\nIt opens on a sly interpolation of the Geoff Mack country standard \"I've Been Everywhere,\" a song that truly has been everywhere, to the extent that when a version done by Johnny Cash in 1996 resurfaced in a U.S. Postal Service ad last year, a lot of listeners may have been surprised to hear him \"covering\" Rihanna. Not that anything about this track feels even slightly country. It's a dancefloor-packing banger with a thumping house beat and an urgent vocal from RiRi, who's been everywhere, man, looking for someone. It topped the Billboard dance charts and won Best Dance Performance (deservedly so) at the Soul Train Awards.\n\nMore:Rihanna has arrived in Phoenix for her Super Bowl halftime performance — on a mural, anyway\n\n18. 'Needed Me' (2016)\n\nThis anti-romantic anthem is one of the edgier moments on her latest album, musically and lyrically. The production is dark and futuristic, slinking along at an ominous crawl as Rihanna brushes off a lover with an attitude that would destroy most men on the receiving end. “I was good on my own,” she begins. “That’s the way it was / You was good on the low for a faded (expletive) / on some faded love.” She doesn’t need his white horse or his carriage. She got what she wanted, and now it’s time for him to get his own damn cab ride home.\n\nMore music:Ultimate guide to the Super Bowl Experience at Hance Park in Phoenix\n\n17. 'Don't Stop the Music' (2007)\n\nMichael Jackson earned a writing credit for the sampling of \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-koosa,\" a hook the Gloved One borrowed from Manu Dibango’s “Soul Makossa” to put the thrill in the \"Thriller\" hit \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.\" But it's more about the near-euphoric throbbing of that club beat as Rihanna effortlessly lives up to the disco-friendly promise of that title, pleading 'Please don't stop the music' on the chorus of an ode to finding new love on the dancefloor as contagious as Madonna in her prime. It topped the dance charts for obvious reasons and became a massive global smash.\n\nMore:Cardi B, Offset playing Super Bowl Hall of Fame Party in metro Phoenix. How to get tickets\n\n16. 'Diamonds' (2012)\n\nA brooding ballad driven by a nagging dance beat, RiRi's 12th chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100 was written by Sia in collaboration with the song's producers, Benny Blanco and Stargate. You may tempted, in fact, to believe that's actually Sia repeating \"Shine bright like a diamond\" but that's just Rihanna doing all she can to channel what she liked about the character in Sia's vocal on the demo. The rest of the vocal is pure Rihanna, impassioned and soulful and fully committed to making the audience want to see themselves in the single's empowering lyrics.\n\n15. 'B---- Better Have My Money' (2015)\n\nThis platinum single peaked at No. 15, which is higher than most murder ballads were charting in 2015. It’s on the darker side of the Rihanna spectrum and yet she sounds completely natural delivering threats with the off-handed shrug of a professional. Is it dark and disturbing? Yes. But that’s what makes it work, work, work, work, work, work. The production is suitably creepy. And that definitely adds to the appeal. But the casual swagger of Rihanna’s vocal is what ultimately seals the deal here. I would have her money if I owed her money after hearing this one, but as luck would have it, I don’t even know her.\n\n14. 'FourFiveSeconds' (2015)\n\nYou may have seen the power trio of Rihanna, Kanye West and Paul McCartney do this on the Grammys. And by power trio, I mean a trio of powerful figures, including an actual Beatle (still bigger than Yeezus). McCartney's contributions here are kept to strumming an acoustic guitar and possibly contributing some harmony. The lead vocals are shared by Rihanna, who brings soulful grit to the proceeding after starting the song with an endearing squeak, and West, who brings requisite swagger to slang-heavy lyrics that are, frankly, on the hit-or-miss side. 'Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz?!' The good news is the hook is undeniable enough to make the weaker lines worthwhile.\n\n13. 'Take a Bow' (2008)\n\nIt could be argued that this single is Rihanna at her schmaltziest. And you would win that argument. But here’s the thing. The vocal plays to all her soulful strengths. And the lyrics are occasionally kind of funny, which offsets the schmaltz. Take the opening verse: “You look so dumb right now / Standing outside my house.” And the second verse is genius: “Grab your clothes and get gone / You better hurry up / Before the sprinklers come on.” This song became her third chart-topping entry on the Hot 100, going on to be certified quadruple-platinum.\n\n12. 'Stay' (2013)\n\nThis ballad stalled at No. 4 on Billboard’s Hot 100, but that didn’t stop it from finishing 13th on the year-end Hot 100. It starts as a piano ballad with an aching vocal from Rihanna and never kicks in like you half-expect it to the first time through, not even after Mikky Ekko makes his entrance. The best part is the two voices coming together on “Funny you’re the broken one but I’m the only one who needed saving / ’Cause when you never see the light it’s hard to know which one of us is caving.”\n\n11. 'SOS' (2006)\n\nHer first chart-topping entry on the Billboard Hot 100 samples Soft Cell’s New Wave reinvention of the old Ed Cobb song “Tainted Love” to glorious effect. She even paraphrases a few of the lyrics, pouting “You got me tossin’ and turnin’ / Can’t sleep at night.” The first single released from “A Girl Like Me,” the singer’s second album, it spent three weeks at No. 1 on its way to going double-platinum. The New Wave vibe is undeniable, and yet it topped the dance charts. In 2006.\n\n10. 'Disturbia' (2008)\n\nIt's kind of weird that this would be the follow-up to the piano-driven lite-soul balladry of “Take a Bow.” But this song fits her outfits better with its throbbing club beat and electronic handclaps while her voice is filtered through some of the quirkiest Auto-Tune sorcery since Cher asked us whether or not we believe in a life after love (which, for the record, I do not) for an overall effect that effortlessly picks up on the New Wave vibe of \"SOS.\" Best line: \"bum bum de-dum bum bum de-dum bum.\"\n\n9. 'Kiss it Better' (2016)\n\nThere are obvious echoes of Prince’s glory days informing nearly every aspect of this soulful slow jam, from the tone on that guitar lick that opens the record to the vocal blend on the “What are you willing to do?” part. It’s a moody track, with Rihanna convincing her ex to “kiss it better,” brushing off the complications with “Who cares when it feels like crack?” and overruling his objections with “Man, (expletive) yo pride / Just take it on back, boy, take it on back.” This \"Anti\" single didn't do much on the pop charts but it should have.\n\n8. 'Rude Boy' (2010)\n\nIs this a song about Rihanna having fallen for a ska fan? Or is there some other kind of rude boy? There is a certain dancehall vibe at work here, but I'm pretty sure she means a less specific kind of rude boy, one who might respond well to her sexual advances, which range from taunts of \"Is you big enough?\" to promises of \"I'm-a let you be the captain.\" Christina Aguilera may have dressed more like a dominatrix in 2010, but no one asserted her sexual dominance with more success than Rihanna on this track, the 16th-biggest single on the year-end Hot 100.\n\n7. 'Work' (2016)\n\nA moody dancehall-flavored ballad with a minimalist approach to constructing a groove, making excellent use of empty space, this global smash features Drake as the sensitive lothario he plays so well. “If you had a twin, I would still choose you,” he tells her. “I don’t wanna rush into it, if it’s too soon / But I know you know you need to get done, done, done, done.” And by done, he means exactly what you think he means. The man is as subtle with sexual innuendo as Joey on “Friends.” The emotional investment here is all Rihanna, and she nails it. And by nails, I do not mean what Drake would mean.\n\n6. 'Pon de Replay' (2005)\n\nThis dancehall pop hit was Rihanna’s first single, but I swear that isn’t why I’ve rated it so high. That beat, a thumping precursor to “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),” is undeniable. So is the chorus hook, in which Rihanna pleads with Mr. DJ, “Won’t you turn the music up?” The title is apparently Bajan Creole for “play it again.” If I spoke Bajan Creole, I could speak to the reliability of that translation, but it’s what I’ve read. The single peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100, going double platinum.\n\n5. 'Only Girl (In the World)' (2010)\n\nThis synth-driven Europop club banger was named Best Dance Recording at the Grammys for a reason. By the time that thumping dance beat kicks in on the chorus hook, if you’re not dancing, that just means you don’t like dancing. A six-times-platinum smash, it topped the Hot 100 and the Billboard dance charts. And that hard-hitting dance beat is topped by an impassioned vocal, Rihanna demanding, “Want you to make me feel like I’m the only girl in the world / Like I’m the only one that you’ll ever love / Like I’m the only one who knows your heart.”\n\n4. 'Umbrella' (2007)\n\nFor romance in the club, you'd be hard pressed to top \"Umbrella,\" a promise to be there on a rainy day with her trusty umbrella to make it all better for you. In one of the catchier choruses to top the charts this century, she tells him, \"When the sun shines, we'll shine together. Told you I'll be here forever. Said I'll always be a friend. Took an oath I'm-a stick it out till the end. Now that it's raining more than ever, know that we'll still have each other. You can stand under my umbrella.\" After filling the summer with thoughts of downpours, it finished second on the year-end Hot 100, right behind Beyoncé's \"Irreplaceable.\"\n\n3. 'We Found Love' (2011)\n\nRihanna sounds good in the club. This nine-times-platinum electro triumph is her biggest-selling single ever, spending 10 weeks in the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100. It was written and produced by Calvin Harris, who pushes the beat here with an urgency that’s less aggressive than what the producers behind “Only Girl (In the World)\" would have done. And that restraint can be seductive (albeit a much different kind of seductive restraint than Rihanna salutes in the song at the top of our countdown). That ascending synth coming out of the opening chorus is a stroke of genius, “A Day in the Life” for the dance floor. And Rihanna’s vocal is flawless, from the time she makes her entrance, her dreamy delivery juxtaposed against a driving synth hook, to her wistful phrasing on “The way I’m feeling I just can’t deny but I’ve gotta let it go.”\n\n2. 'S&M' (2011)\n\nSome people found this shocking. What's shocking is how long it took Rihanna to realize that she hadn't done a song called \"S&M\" yet. Is it kinky by numbers? Sure. But I would play those numbers. When I first heard the throbbing electro-pop chorus, I was sure she couldn't come up with a line more quintessentially Rihanna than \"I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it.\" But then she turned around and followed through with \"Sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me.\" A remix starring Britney Spears spent one extremely kinky week at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100.\n\n1. 'Love on the Brain' (2016)\n\nThis soulful throwback to the sort of ballad Otis Redding might have done, complete with Hammond B3 organ and doo-wop-flavored backing vocals, somehow topped the Billboard dance charts on its way to going six times platinum. It doesn’t feel like the sort of song that would become Rihanna's 22nd Top 5 entry on the Billboard Hot 100. But it does feel timeless. And I know I’m not alone in thinking timeless may even be better than topping the charts with a song that feels completely of the moment. Her delivery could not feel more wounded and it really shows you what she has to offer as a vocalist.\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.
