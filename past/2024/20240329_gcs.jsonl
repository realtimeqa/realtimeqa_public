Air raid sirens rang out prior to the explosions. Maksym Kozytsky, the head of the Lviv regional military administration, later on his Telegram account reported three more explosions following the strike on the fuel depot, saying, “The air alarm remains.”\n\nLviv is a strategic Ukrainian city close to the Polish border that has largely been spared from the relentless bombardment seen across much of the country during the Russian invasion. It was a surprising attack, coming just a day after the Russian military said that the first phase of the conflict had ended and that it was shifting its attention to the disputed eastern parts of Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian military on Sunday confirmed strikes on fuel depots on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv and outside of Kyiv, saying it had targeted fuel supplies for Ukrainian troops.\n\nIn a briefing Sunday, Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also confirmed a separate strike on Lviv Saturday, saying cruise missiles had targeted the workshops of the Lviv radio repair plant, which he claimed carried out the overhaul and modernization of Ukrainian weapons systems.\n\nSeparately, Konashenkov claimed that sea-launched weapons had targeted a Ukrainian missile storage facility 30 kilometers southwest of Kyiv.\n\nSadovyi said in an update on Twitter Sunday that it took firefighters 14 hours to put out the fire.\n\nThe attack came as US President Joe Biden was in Poland Saturday, where he met with his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, as well as Ukrainian officials and refugees. Biden later delivered a speech outside the Royal Castle in the Polish capital of Warsaw, in which he declared forcefully that Russian President Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power.”\n\nThe White House afterward said Biden wasn’t calling for regime change: “The President’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,” a White House official said.\n\nEarlier in the speech, Biden told the Ukrainian people: “We stand with you. Period.” Biden was briefed on the strike on Lviv before leaving his hotel for his speech, according to a White House official.\n\n“Now in the perennial struggle for democracy and freedom, Ukraine and its people are on the front lines, fighting to save their nation, and their brave resistance is part of a larger fight for … essential democratic principles that unite all free people,” Biden said.\n\nSmoke rises in the air in Lviv, western Ukraine on Saturday. Nariman El-Mofty/AP\n\nSadovyi initially said on Twitter Saturday that Russian troops had attacked the city but did not provide extensive detail. He urged residents to stay in shelters.\n\nAn industrial facility in Lviv used for fuel storage was burned as a result of one of the Russian strikes, according to Sadovyi.\n\n“As a result of the shelling, one of the industrial facilities burns. It is fuel storage,” the mayor said. He did not clarify if this was the cause of the smoke.\n\nThe mayor added that “habitable infrastructure was not injured.”\n\nSadovyi later confirmed that another strike had hit Lviv, causing “significant damage” to the city’s infrastructure. Residential buildings were not damaged, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said Saturday that bus convoys trying to evacuate civilians were being stopped and held by Russian forces, as part of what they claimed to be a pressure campaign to force some residents to go to Russia.\n\nIn a statement, Oleksandr Starukh, the head of the Zaporizhzhia regional administration, said an evacuation convoy of more than 50 buses driving from the besieged Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to Zaporizhzhia was held overnight at a Russian checkpoint in Vasylivka, about 35 miles south of Zaporizhzhia. Starukh said the convoy included two ambulances carrying three children requiring urgent medical care.\n\nSaturday’s strikes were not the first strikes on Lviv. Several Russian missiles hit an aircraft repair plant there on March 18. Work at the facility had stopped before the strikes, and there were no reports of casualties.\n\nSaturday’s attacks come after a top Russian general claimed Friday that the “first stage” of Russia’s military plan was complete, with their primary focus now centered on eastern Ukraine.\n\nIt was unclear if the statement implied a shifting of the goalposts for the Russian military or just represents a change in public messaging.\n\n“In general, the main tasks of the first stage of the operation have been completed,” said Col. General Sergei Rudskoy, first deputy chief of Russia’s General Staff, in a briefing. “The combat potential of the armed forces of Ukraine has been significantly reduced, allowing us, I emphasize again, to focus the main efforts on achieving the main goal - the liberation of Donbas.”\n\nAfter days of Western leaders displaying their united front against Russia, Saturday’s strikes could be seen as a response from Putin and his military to Biden and the West.\n\nThe Russian military has claimed it is not targeting civilians or residential areas, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.", "authors": ["Nathan Hodge Julia Kesaieva Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Nathan Hodge", "Julia Kesaieva", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2023/08/20/hurricane-hilary-live-updates-storm-nears-baja-palm-springs-road-closures-state-of-emergency-declare/70635806007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary updates: 1-10 east and west closed amid flooding", "text": "The Coachella Valley — which was under an unprecedented tropical storm warning until it was lifted around 2 a.m. Monday — is experiencing heavy flooding and other damage after Tropical Storm Hilary churned through the region on Sunday.\n\nLatest road closures across the Coachella Valley\n\nSeveral roads continue to be closed due to storm damage and flooding across the Coachella Valley, leaving significant clean-up work to allow residents to travel across the valley again.\n\n“This storm has been unlike anything our community has faced before.

Ross and her husband spent the afternoon checking on neighbors and attempting to keep nearby culverts clear of debris. The Cathedral City Fire Department also came to the park this afternoon to help evacuate several people out of their homes who couldn’t get past the rushing water in the road.\n\n“It’s a senior citizen mobile home park, many of our people are in their 80s. They just don’t deserve to be in such a vulnerable situation, that’s for sure,” said Ross.\n\n—Erin Rode\n\nThousands of IID customers without power\n\nOver 7,000 Imperial Irrigation District customers are currently without power, with storm-related power outages reported across the district’s eastern Coachella Valley and Imperial County service area.

Larson Foundation Trauma Center. In one photo, an abandoned golf cart sits submerged in water.\n\nBut Lee Rice, the medical center’s public information officer, said that none of it has affected any patient care areas of the hospital.\n\n“Fortunately, it hasn’t had any impact on our patient care areas,” Rice said. “So, it’s business as usual for us.”\n\nOnline videos showed the inside of Eisenhower with a small amount of water in the back hallways, with towels on the floor to absorb the moisture.\n\nRice said that some of the flooding has merely forced Eisenhower to divert ambulances to another section of the hospital that has not experienced the effects of the ongoing rainfall that has come with Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\nEisenhower is in its slower time of year, which is typical during the summer months, Rice said. She added that it has helped Eisenhower avoid any serious challenges during the storm.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Eisenhower closed urgent care facilities in Palm Springs, Rancho Mirage and La Quinta but left Emergency Department services open and available to the community as needed.\n\n—Andrew John\n\nCenter of storm nears Coachella Valley\n\nAt 5 p.m., the National Hurricane Center reported the center of Tropical Storm Hilary was located 25 miles south-southwest of Palm Springs and moving north at 23 mph.\n\nAs Hilary moved closer to the Coachella Valley, strong winds have picked up.

The school said it is anticipating some minor damage caused by flooding and leaks.\n\nCollege of the Desert will also be closed on Monday, although classes for the new semester are not set to begin until next week. College of the Desert \"currently has a lot of water and debris on site,\" and the Palm Desert campus has also \"experienced some water intrusion in key areas.\"\n\nSchool officials are asking everyone to remain off campus, and \"no business will be conducted at any location, with the exception of COD’s Maintenance Team and Campus Safety Team, who will help assess the damage and determine any challenges to student or work spaces.\" Regular business is expected to resume on Tuesday.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio and Erin Rode\n\nStorm shelter at Desert Mirage High School\n\nDesert Mirage High School in Thermal is being used as a temporary storm shelter, according to the Coachella Valley Unified School District.\n\nThe shelter is open to the public and includes a dedicated reception area and a cooling zone. The district said it expects the shelter to be open until Monday or Tuesday afternoon, with more information to be sent out as the storm continues.\n\n—Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nPalm Springs declares local emergency\n\nPalm Springs City Manager Scott Stiles has declared a local emergency because of the storm, city spokesperson Amy Blaisdell said.\n\nShe said the declaration opens up access to extra resources, such as funds for repairs from storm damage and more flexibility with emergency purchases.\n\nCity law gives the manager the authority to proclaim a local emergency, but it must be ratified by the city council within seven days or it becomes invalid.\n\nMore road closures across valley\n\nMore roads are closing across the Coachella Valley as police advise residents not to drive. Closures were being announced frequently; below is only a partial list:\n\nPalm Springs: Police announced the closure of two more roads in Palm Springs. Farrell Drive was closed between Ramon Road and Mesquite Road.\n\nEl Cielo Road was also closed at Mesquite Avenue, while the Dinah Shore Bridge is closed from Palm Springs to Cathedral City. Golf Club Drive is also closed at the Whitewater Wash.\n\nIndian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino were already closed at the washes.\n\nCathedral City: Cathedral Canyon Drive and Dinah Shore Drive were also closed by Cathedral City Police. Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive was already closed.\n\nEast valley: 66th Street was closed between Van Buren Street and Jackson Street. Box Canyon Road from Interstate 10 to the All American Canal was closed in the Mecca area.\n\nEven in areas where roads weren't fully closed, conditions were treacherous. Just after 4 p.m., two of the three eastbound lanes of Highway 111 were closed due to rocks in the road at the Cathedral City-Rancho Mirage border.\n\nPalm Springs Police Lt. Gustavo Araiza advised residents to avoid travel in the city unless absolutely necessary and to drive with extreme caution if they must.\n\n“We don’t need collisions tying up resources,” he said.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio, Jay Calderon\n\nNewsom, Palm Springs officials discuss storm preparedness, bridge request in Sunday visit\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom stopped in Palm Springs on Sunday as Tropical Storm Hilary wrecked havoc on the Coachella Valley. He met with Palm Springs city councilmembers and staff in the city’s emergency operations center.\n\nNewsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California on Saturday to support the Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nThe city posted photos of the visit on its Facebook page Sunday, explaining that city staff updated the governor on the city’s storm preparations while Newsom offered “whatever assistance he could provide to the city.” The post noted that Newsom had been “instrumental in bringing Oakland Urban Search and Rescue and Swift Water California OES Task Force teams to Palm Springs,\" where they were going to be used to assist with rescues during the storm.\n\nThey also discussed the city's request for an elevated bridge on North Indian Canyon Drive over the Whitewater Wash. The Coachella Valley Association of Governments has been trying to secure funding for such a bridge, which would reduce the need for rain and wind-related closures.\n\nPhotos show Newsom adding his name to the Emergency Operations Center sign-in sheet during his visit. Palm Springs Mayor Grace Garner, City Councilmember Lisa Middleton, City Manager Scott Stiles, Police Chief Andrew Mills and Fire Chief Paul Alvarado are pictured meeting with Newsom during the visit.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nUpdated rain totals: Palm Desert sees 1.18 inches by 2 p.m.\n\nHeavy rain has moved through the Coachella Valley and brought soaking rains that have flooded many streets and intersections. Here are the latest rain totals from the National Weather Service as of 2 p.m., with rain still falling.\n\nPalm Desert 1.18 inches\n\nCathedral Canyon 1 inch\n\nThermal airport 0.91 inches\n\nPalm Springs Airport 0.89 inches\n\nLower Tahquitz Creek 0.86 inches\n\nFlash flood, severe thunderstorm warning issued for some Coachella Valley cities\n\nThe National Weather Service in San Diego has issued Flash Flood Warnings for most of the Coachella Valley until 5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nSome locations that will experience flash flooding include Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage, Indian Wells, Indio, Coachella, Thermal, La Quinta, Mecca and the Santa Rosa Mountain.\n\nAt 1:51 p.m., doppler radar and automated rain gauges indicated heavy rain falling across the warned area. The expected rainfall rate is 0.5 to 1 inch in 1 hour. Hourly rainfall rates in Palm Desert have exceeded 0.75 inches per hour. Flash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m., doppler radar indicated heavy rain across the warned area. Rainfall rates of three-quarters of an inch per hour are occurring.\n\nFlash flooding is ongoing or expected to begin shortly. The weather service warns life threatening flash flooding is possible from heavy rain, particularly of creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses.\n\nMotorists should turn around, don`t drown when encountering flooded roads. Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary: Heavier rain, winds forecast for Palm Springs area Sunday\n\nThe Coachella Valley remains under a tropical storm warning on Sunday morning, and a flood watch is in effect until 5 p.m. on Monday. Light rain is falling at Palm Springs International — as of 8 a.m., 0.32 inches had fallen since midnight — and the temperature is a cool 78 degrees with 88% humidity and 6-mph winds out of the southwest, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nBut more rain, and heavier wind, is on the way. Thunderstorms are in the forecast throughout the day, with an additional two to four inches of rain expected in the valley, along with wind gusts of up to 40 to 50 mph. Temps are expected to top out at 86 degrees.\n\nNWS Meteorologist Adam Roser said the biggest threat in the Coachella Valley is \"definitely flash flooding.\"\n\n\"Many of the mountain roads going into the valley are very vulnerable,\" he said. \"As are any of those that go over those washes and things like that.'\n\nRoser said most of the rain will fall in heavy bands that could potentially produce 2 inches of rain an hour in the afternoon. There also remains a small chance of tornadoes in the valley, he said.\n\n\"WIth tropical storm systems, any tornadoes are usually weak and brief, but the storm prediction center does have around a 5% chance of a tornado occurring in the area,\" he said.\n\nThe rain and wind will likely be finished by the time most people are waking up on Monday morning, Roser said.\n\n— Kate Franco, Paul Albani-Burgio\n\nHow much rain has fallen so far?\n\nSo far, Tropical Storm Hilary has brought a light but steady rainfall to the Coachella Valley, but weather forecasts advise the rain should become heavier on Sunday afternoon and evening.\n\nAs of noon, official National Weather Service rain totals included 0.40 at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.46 in Thermal at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport, 0.46 in Thousand Palms and 0.36 in Palm Desert.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHilary makes landfall over Baja California\n\nThe now-downgraded Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall along Mexico's Baja California coast Sunday as concerns mounted over the storm causing what could be deadly flash flooding in the border city of Tijuana, Southern California and places as far north as Idaho that rarely get such heavy rain.\n\nHilary hit the coast in a sparsely populated area about 150 miles south of Ensenada.\n\nThe storm has already caused flooding in places across Mexico’s arid peninsula and threatens to unleash torrential rains on mudslide-prone Tijuana, where many improvised houses cling to steep hillsides just south of the U.S. border.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could cause extreme flooding, mudslides and even tornadoes. Parts of the U.S. Southwest could be hit with once-in-a-century rains and there is a good chance Hilary could break all-time records as the wettest known tropical cyclone to douse Nevada, Oregon and Idaho.\n\nAs of 11 a.m. Pacific time, Hilary was located about 215 miles south-southeast of San Diego, the National Hurricane Center reported. Hilary had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nThe Mexican cities of Ensenada and Tijuana, directly in the storm’s path, closed all beaches and opened a half-dozen shelters at sports complexes and government offices.\n\n—The Associated Press\n\nEvacuation order near Banning\n\nRiverside County has issued an evacuation order north of Banning and near the Morongo Reservation as the worst of Tropical Storm Hilary's impacts approach.\n\nThe county's emergency management department announced the order late Sunday morning for the Mias zone in the Apple/ElDorado burn scar.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSplash House says it will carry on amid storm\n\nOrganizers of Splash House said the Palm Springs pool party and music festival will go on Sunday despite Tropical Storm Hilary's expected inundation of the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California.\n\nEarlier in the weekend, the festival had been moved inside at the three hotels where it's held, which are miles apart.\n\n\"We're gonna keep it real with you — we're not big fans of today's projected weather,\" organizers wrote in an Instagram post about 10 a.m. Sunday. \"But we are big fans of keeping this party going safely. Let's take things inside and close out this weekend in unprecedented style!\"\n\nEvents will be at the Renaissance, Margaritaville Resort and Saguaro Palm Springs hotels between about 1 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to an online schedule.\n\n\"Shuttles with run as planned between hotels,\" the Instagram post said, without addressing the possible heavy rain — predicted to be as much as two inches an hour at times Sunday afternoon.\n\nLocal and national officials, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, have advised people to stay indoors and off the roads during the storm.\n\nLater, organizers seemingly acknowledged the storm could make it hard for festival attendees from out of town to drive or fly out as scheduled. They posted a list of hotels that were offering late checkout and discounted rates for extending stays.\n\n—Eric Hartley\n\nMost flights canceled out of Palm Springs on Sunday\n\nAhead of the anticipated impacts from now Tropical Storm Hilary, a majority of airlines have canceled flights in and out of Palm Springs International Airport on Sunday.\n\nAs of 9 a.m., only five of 15 flight arrivals through 6 p.m were still scheduled. United, American and WestJet all canceled flights into the airport. Southwest Airlines canceled its entire Sunday schedule at the airport a day earlier.\n\nDelta’s flight from Salt Lake City to Palm Springs that arrives at 12:18 p.m. Sunday was one of the few still scheduled.\n\nEight of 10 evening flight arrivals into Palm Springs were still scheduled, as were several evening departures, but airport officials cautioned anyone flying to check ahead with their airline before arriving at the airport.\n\n—Matt Solinsky\n\nHurricane Hilary within striking distance of Baja early Sunday\n\nThe National Weather Center in Miami said in the most recent advisory at 2 a.m. that Hurricane Hilary was about 30 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 385 miles from San Diego, California. The maximum sustained wind speed remained unchanged at 85 mph while spreading “heavy rains” northward over the peninsula.\n\nMeteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous. Forecasters said the storm was still expected to enter the history books as the first tropical storm to hit Southern California in 84 years, bringing flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nElizabeth Adams, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service San Diego office, said rain could fall up to 3 inches an hour across the desert and mountains surrounding the Coachella Valley and beyond from late Sunday morning into the afternoon. The intense rainfall during those hours could cause widespread and life-threatening flash floods.\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether officials considered the fatality related to the hurricane, but video posted by local officials showed torrents of water coursing through the town’s streets.\n\nThe forecast prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\n— The Associated Press\n\nHurricane Hilary: Storm drops 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Sunday\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Sunday, rainfall totals since midnight were 0.32 inches at Palm Springs International Airport, 0.41 inches at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal and 0.29 inches in Thousand Palms, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n— Matt Solinsky\n\nRain totals so far Sunday in Palm Springs area\n\nPreliminary precipitation data from the National Weather Service's San Diego station shows 24-hour rain totals as of 5 a.m. Sunday in the Coachella Valley vary from 0.86 inches in Thermal to 0.04 inches in Indio Hills. Palm Springs International Airport reported 0.18 inches of rain so far.\n\nThermal: 0.86 inches\n\nMorongo Valley: 0.39 inches\n\nDesert Hot Springs: 0.31 inches\n\nPalm Springs International Airport: 0.18 inches\n\nPalm Desert: 0.16 inches\n\nIndio Hills: 0.04 inches\n\n— Kate Franco\n\nRoad closures in Palm Springs, Cathedral City\n\nPalm Springs: Indian Canyon Drive, Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino will be closed at the washes until further notice in preparation of potential flooding due to Hurricane Hilary, the Palm Springs Police Department announced late Saturday.\n\nCathedral City: Los Gatos Road at Date Palm Drive has been closed, city officials said Saturday.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declares State of Emergency\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom issued a State of Emergency for much of Southern California Saturday to support the Hurricane Hilary response and recovery efforts as the state continues mobilizing and coordinating resources ahead of the storm's forecasted impacts.\n\nHeavy rainfall and high winds were expected to last through Monday. At the governor's direction, there were currently more than 7,500 boots on the ground deployed to help local communities protect Californians from the impacts of Hilary.\n\nThe governor also signed an emergency proclamation in San Diego while visiting with California National Guard troops. He met with first responders and local officials, including San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. He was also in touch with federal officials, including the White House.\n\nThe Emergency Medical Services Authority has assets on standby, including California Medical Assistance Teams to augment local capacity, aid in evacuations and support medical needs in communities impacted by flooding. The EMSA was ready to assist with Ambulance Strike Teams as necessary to support local communities. The Flood Operations Center is activated and has prepositioned flood-fight materials should they be needed.\n\n—City News Service\n\nSandbag availability low, exhausted in some valley cities\n\nSand and sandbags are no longer available at local fire stations in Palm Desert as of Saturday afternoon. Instead, residents can find these resources at the Palm Desert Civic Center, 43-900 San Pablo Ave., Palm Desert.\n\nRancho Mirage ran out of sand at its distribution site at the Rancho Mirage Library & Observatory parking lot, so many people took their empty bags to a nearby empty lot to fill them with sand straight from the ground. Empty sandbags are still available for Rancho Mirage residents at Fire Station 69 at 71-751 Gerald Ford Drive. Proof of Rancho Mirage address is required.\n\nIndian Wells announced mid-afternoon on Saturday that sandbags are no longer available from that city, and residents are encouraged to seek supplies from local home improvement stores, instead.\n\n—Niki Kottmann\n\nHurricane Hilary: How experts say you should prepare\n\nTwo Palm Springs emergency officials have some advice for valley residents on how they can prepare their homes and themselves for the storm. The officials are Capt. Nathan Gunkel of the city fire department and Daniel DeSelms, Palm Springs’ emergency management coordinator.\n\nTo protect yourself:\n\nThey said residents should make sure they have enough food and water to make it through a few days, including food that can be eaten if the power goes out.\n\nThey also recommended preparing for the power outages by charging their cellphones and making sure they have flashlights and batteries on hand. DeSelms said he generally recommends using flashlights rather than candles because of the fire risks that come with candles.\n\nIn general, they said residents should be prepared to remain at home for multiple days as it will likely be unsafe to go out during the storm and roads could potentially remained closed or impassable even after it passes.\n\nGunkel recommended that residents make sure they know how to get out of their neighborhoods in the event the city does need to evacuate, keeping in mind that roads like Indian Canyon Drive and Gene Autry Road will likely be impassable. However, he said people should remember it is impossible to anticipate which other roads may be closed.\n\nTo protect your home:\n\nBoth DeSelms and Gunkel recommend residents make use of the free sandbags Palm Springs and other cities and agencies are providing, particularly if their homes have ever experienced flooding in the past. It often makes sense to place sand bags in front of the front door or other places where water might pool, Gunkel said.\n\nDeSelms also said those with leaky roofs can put a tarp over them. However, he cautioned that it is important to try to make sure the tarp will be secured enough to withstand the strong expected winds.\n\n— Paul Albani-Burgio", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2024/01/02/japan-earthquake-damage-photos/72083171007/", "title": "Japan earthquake damage photos: Buildings collapse in Wajima ...", "text": "Images emerging from Japan show flattened buildings and collapsed roads after a powerful earthquake hit the nation's western coast Monday afternoon and temporarily triggered a tsunami warning.\n\nThe 7.6 earthquake hit Ishikawa, about 180 miles west of Tokyo.

Philadelphia Energy Solutions Refining Complex spokeswoman Cherice Corley said the fire broke out around 4 a.m. It burned for hours.\n\nThe fire was contained by 7.am. but not under control, said Craig Murphy, the city's deputy fire commissioner. Nearby residents were asked to shelter in place.\n\nFire Commissioner Adam Thiel said in a news release Friday afternoon that EMS teams treated one person at the scene. Four others were treated at Philadelphia Energy Solutions' clinic.\n\n“The Fire Marshal’s Office will investigate the cause and origin of the fire once the incident is over and the scene is safe to enter. But the investigation will take time. For now, this remains a dynamic situation,\" Thiel said in the statement.\n\nThick, black smoke billowed across the city when the fire started.\n\n\"The whole sky lit up yellow,\" Antonio Tindle told WPVI-TV. \"The third explosion rocked my truck. The whole truck started to rock and it got kind of scary.\"\n\nMurphy said a vat of butane ignited and eventually exploded. A series of smaller explosions occurred as the fire worked its way through the pipes carrying fuel across the complex. Refinery emergency crews and firefighters responded to the scene.\n\nPhiladelphia Energy Solutions says the oil-refining complex is the largest on the U.S. Eastern seaboard, processing 335,000 barrels of crude oil daily. It was the second blaze at the refinery this month, following a June 10 fire in which no injuries were reported.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said the refinery assured him in a Friday morning conference call that the fires were unrelated in nature and cause. He said a working group would be assembled to discuss the issues, with a focus on air quality for nearby residents.\n\n\"I believe there is room for improvement, both in the operation of the refinery in light of two fires in as many weeks, and in the communication to residents,\" Kenney said.\n\nPhiladelphia Public Health spokesman James Garrow said in a news release that there were no findings pointing to immediate danger for the community living around the refinery.\n\n“Preliminary testing both at the site of the refinery and in the adjacent community has shown no ambient carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (combustibles) or hydrogen sulfide,\" Garrow said Friday. \"Samples were also taken from up- and down-wind of the refinery.\"\n\nGarrow said an analysis of tests will be released when completed, probably later Friday.\n\nFollow Adam Duvernay on Twitter: @duvINdelaware.\n\nContributors: Shawn Marsh, Associated Press, and Bruce Shipkowski, Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/03/27/baltimore-mayor-brandon-scott-bridge-collapse/73123065007/", "title": "Bridge collapse latest challenge for Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott", "text": "No one had seen a big-city mayor quite like Brandon Scott before.\n\nHe was 36 when he won his race in Baltimore in November 2020. In a city half a century older than the United States, Scott became the youngest mayor in its history.\n\nOf course, no one had seen a November like the one in 2020.\n\nIt was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. People across the country were largely still hunkered down. Scott wore a mask to his swearing-in ceremony. Nobody attended except his parents. He rocked an afro he had grown because the barbershops were closed.\n\nWe’re starting to forget some of this, four years later, but let us remember just how scary that time was. We were at the pandemic’s worst hour, when the death toll would reach 100,000 a month. Nobody knew how many more of us would die. The first vaccines were just starting to be approved. Most of us had no idea when we would get one.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“As your mayor,” Scott said at his swearing-in, “I will not waver or hesitate to make decisions that save lives and protect our economy.”\n\nThree years and four months later, the mayor’s phone rang in the middle of the night. No one in Baltimore could imagine what they were about to see.\n\nA hulking container ship lost control of its steering and careened into a tower of the Francis Scott Key Bridge. In a matter of seconds, that iconic bridge – traveled daily by more than 30,000 vehicles – plunged into Baltimore’s harbor.\n\nNobody knew, in those first predawn moments, how many people might have been killed, or what would happen next.\n\n“This is a tragedy that you could never imagine,” Scott said Tuesday, during a news conference. “Never would you think that you would see – physically see – the Key Bridge tumble down like that. It looked like something out of an action movie.”\n\nReporters immediately wanted to know about the future, about the rebuilding of the bridge. Scott wanted to remain rooted in the present. He was emotional.\n\n“We shouldn't even be having that discussion right now,” he said. \"The discussion right now should be about the people, the souls, the lives that we're trying to save.”\n\n“There will be a time to discuss a bridge and how we get a bridge back up,” Scott said. “But right now there are people in the water that we have to get out, and that is the only thing we should be talking about.”\n\nIt’s a heavy burden, isn’t it? The weight of 30,000 cars and trucks every day, of six bridge workers lost in 48-degree water, somewhere in the dark. The weight of 150,000 infections, of one person out of every 300 in your city having died of COVID.\n\nBut there’s a greater weight than that in Baltimore.\n\nSaving lives in Baltimore\n\nScott, who grew up in Park Heights in Northwest Baltimore was 39 by now, a mayor who has spent a full term working to save people’s lives. I talked to him about that very thing, not so long ago.\n\nWe weren’t wearing masks, and we certainly weren’t talking about boats or bridges. We were talking, instead, about our most American contagion: The nearly 50,000 people who die of gun violence every year.\n\nBaltimore has been a historically violent city. More than 300 murders a year, every year. Yet Scott has been fighting that narrative and winning.\n\nJust Monday, he delivered his State of the City address, touting the largest single-year decline in homicides the city has ever seen. The 20% reduction marked the first time in nearly a decade that Baltimore saw fewer than 300 homicides a year.\n\nIt can be gleeful, and oftentimes sad, when you sign up for a leadership role in one of America’s vital cities. Calls for celebration may come, but also calls of catastrophe.\n\nScott received the news about the bridge collapse in the wee hours Tuesday, and was on the phone with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore while enroute to the bridge. On Tuesday, Moore acknowledged Scott before the TV cameras.\n\n“Mayor Scott, who literally got a call the very first thing in the morning, I know you have had no rest in a very long time, sir,” he said. “I just want to say how much we appreciate you.”\n\nScott had just celebrated the declining homicide rate a day earlier. I wanted to know how America’s mayors respond to such unexpected adversity, especially after riding a high.\n\nSo I called Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas.\n\nA leader's highs and lows\n\nLucas, too, had ridden a high. His Kansas City Chiefs had won the Super Bowl, and his city had readied a victory parade. Then a shooting at that parade left one person dead and about two dozen wounded, including nine children.\n\nScott and Lucas are friends. They met while serving as council members in their respective cities, long before they became mayors. They are the same age. They are Black men in public service who want to change the narrative – poverty, crime, poor schools – for their constituents. When the Chiefs played the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship game, they watched together at M&T Bank Stadium.\n\n“There was already kind of just a natural Black-dude-running-a-city thing,” Lucas told me Tuesday. “And in a way we wanted to be a breath of fresh air in terms of how a number of things are done. Some of which relates to how transparent we'll be, how authentic we might be, and frankly, presenting and bringing a new generation in cities that sometimes were controlled by those who may represent vestiges of the past.”\n\nLucas said he sent Scott a text Tuesday, but didn’t expect a response. He certainly wasn’t going to call him in the time of crisis, but he just wanted him to know he had support.\n\n“We as urban mayors know that there’s violence in our cities sometimes,” Lucas told me. “There may be an officer-involved shooting, there may be a significant fire – those are the kind of things we’re trained for. A dramatic, gigantic bridge – a gate that limits your ability to take part in an industry that is vital to your city – that to me is trying. And so I thought more personally about him.”\n\nHe described Scott as “one of the better mayors in our country, and certainly one of the more exceptional young leaders in our country.”\n\n“It's easy to try to run in front of cameras,” Lucas told me. “I've met many leaders, many a mayor, who does that sort of thing. That is not Brandon.”\n\n“I know the challenges of a bunch of national press people showing up – a lot of people want answers,” Lucas said. “The questions are tougher. It is not a normal day in Baltimore or Kansas City. It is a day where the most important listeners are those who first were directly impacted. Those who are families of those still missing. That’s where you start.”\n\nThe Francis Scott Key Bridge and the future\n\nThere are years of infrastructure, commuter and commerce challenges to come, too, of course. But the incident has been devastating for Scott, a man who has been vocal about the love he has for the city where he was born and raised. When I interviewed Scott in December, he spoke passionately about the Baltimoreans who lifted him up and encouraged him to dream.\n\n“I have the total city showing me and telling me that I had to be better because it wasn't just about me,” Scott told me. “It was about me being a representation of all of them.”\n\nIn his fourth year as mayor, Scott now has a 3-month-old baby boy – his first child – named Charm after his beloved hometown, known as “Charm City.”\n\nNow, Lucas said, Scott will lean into his compassion for people and his desire to see his city soar.\n\n“He's somebody who actually isn't looking past you,” Lucas said. “You meet a lot of people … and you're like, ‘All right, well, that guy's plotting his run for governor. That guy's plotting his run for United States senator or he wants to be president one day.’ Brandon's a dude who's about Baltimore.”\n\nScott is also running for reelection. He is among 13 Democratic candidates in the May primary. It’s hard to imagine that’s his primary focus now.\n\nScott seems to be seeking friends – and divine support – as he navigates this even bigger crisis than COVID or city homicides. He knows the Key Bridge also provided financial life to those who live, work and travel through Baltimore.\n\n“We know the power of prayer, and in this moment we need a lot of prayer,” Scott said at a Tuesday evening vigil.\n\nWednesday night, there was yet another news conference, this time more certain yet more sad. Moore and others promised support for the families of those who died, and asked the world for support in return. Then Scott, the mayor, stepped forward. Amid a line of suits and uniforms, he was the one in the purple sweatshirt that read: FROM BALTIMORE WITH LOVE.\n\n“To each of the families,” he said, “know that my heart and the heart of the entire city of Baltimore is with you, and will be with you forever.”\n\nUSA TODAY national reporter N’Dea Yancey-Bragg contributed to this report.\n\nSuzette Hackney is a national columnist.

You can sign up here to receive them every week and during significant storms.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s been less than a week since deadly storms impacted the Deep South, and once again we are looking at the potential for the same areas to get more severe storms.\n\nLast Monday, tornadoes swept through towns just north of Austin and killed a woman north of Dallas when her home was destroyed. The following day, a deadly EF-3 tornado raked across the New Orleans area.\n\nWith the threat of tornadoes returning, the thought of it has us shaking our heads. Not again.\n\nMore strong storms expected for the South\n\nWe’re looking at another multiday severe weather week. Tuesday and Wednesday will bring the possibility of severe storms and tornadoes. However, I want to start with Wednesday, because I think it’s going to be our biggest day, then I’ll jump back to Tuesday’s threat.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has placed a Level 3 out of 5 “enhanced” risk of severe weather for Wednesday for parts of the Lower Mississippi River Valley. Jackson, Memphis, Birmingham, Baton Rouge and New Orleans could all see strong storms and even tornadoes.\n\n“The line should enter the region shortly after noon arriving in the Baton Rouge area around 4 p.m., New Orleans 7 p.m., Gulfport 9 p.m. and exit the area around midnight Wednesday night into Thursday morning,” said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in New Orleans.\n\nThe SPC said the main threat with the line of storms will be wind gusts, exceeding hurricane force at times, above 74 mph. And they emphasized tornadoes will be possible. The NWS office in New Orleans echoed the same message in its forecast discussion.\n\n“Even if the line [of storms] remains intact, a QLCS tornadic environment will exist and if this line is capable of breaking into any discrete cells it would further enhance the possibility of tornadic development.”\n\nQLCS (quasi-linear convective system) tornadoes form very quickly with little warning along a line of storms. They are the exact types of tornadoes we talked about last week, which our friend Chris Weiss and other scientists are out in the field trying to study. In fact, Weiss emailed me, saying they were going to be out again this week to once again put their lives on the line to study the storms.\n\nYou never want to hear more storms are headed your way if you are in an area just devastated by a tornado. Lauren Nash, NWS New Orleans meteorologist, told me on the phone they have been trying to get the message out to the public to be prepared.\n\n“So, what we’re just trying to do is tell everybody that every event is different, and every event you need to stay aware. But those who were impacted, not only by the tornado last week, but also by Ida, they’re all in substandard housing. So there just has to be a little extra emphasis on making sure that they stay weather aware and know where to go if a watch or a warning is issued.”\n\nTo be honest, we’re still wrapping our heads around what happened in the New Orleans area last week. The images have been jaw-dropping. A school bus was lifted and carried, we’ve seen entire houses lifted off their foundations, homes and businesses destroyed. It was utter destruction for some neighborhoods in hard-hit St. Bernard Parish.\n\nThe neighborhood of Arabi, near New Orleans, which was hit hard by an EF-3 tornado on March 23. Gerald Herbert/AP\n\nFlying debris is a real threat this week in places where the strongest storms went through last week.\n\nWhere the tornado went through St. Bernard Parish, there is still debris lining some roadways. Nash told me much of it has been cleaned up, but what is still lying around could pose a potential threat if the winds gusts top 60 mph, as expected Wednesday.\n\n“Whenever you have that 60-70 mile per hour winds, it’s going to pick up a lot of that debris. So, it’s important to stay inside when we have a wind advisory out and if we do have warnings, just go into an interior room.”\n\nIf you are in one of the areas where severe weather is expected this week, here’s a quick reminder of how to stay safe when severe weather strikes.\n\nWe will have to watch the forecast closely over the next few days to see if the SPC increases the threat level for storms.\n\nSevere weather to impact the Plains\n\nI mentioned earlier there would also be a threat of severe weather on Tuesday. Here’s where the biggest threat for storms will be, according to the SPC.\n\nPortions of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas are all included in a Level 2 out of 5 risk of severe weather.\n\nDallas, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Kansas City, Missouri, need to be on the lookout for strong storms on Tuesday.

But there was also a 35-year-old woman who officials said drowned. She came out, saw her house taking on too much water, and didn't survive.\n\nHochul said the heavy rain and flooding was just the latest in unprecedented weather events hitting the state over and over. Nine months ago a massive snowstorm swept through and recently a mass of unhealthy air that passed through from wildfires in Canada. \"Once again, the skies opened up and wrought so much rain − nine inches of rain in this community − that they're calling this a 1,000-year event,\" the governor said, adding that government and communities must work together to fight climate change's ravages.\n\nOrange County Executive Steve Neuhaus at the news conference praised the cooperation at all levels in preparing for and responding to the storm. He said many cars tried to go through water, but got stuck, and that active-duty Army personnel walked through deep water to cars to make sure people got out.\n\nNeuhaus said the woman who died was found in the bottom of a ravine and that there were dangers for the first responders as they made their way to remove her. “We saw the debris falling on them as they tried to get her back up to high land where we could get her back to the medical examiner’s office,\" he said.\n\nSeeking federal help\n\nHochul declared a state of emergency for Orange, Rockland and Ontario counties. On Sunday, Neuhaus issued an executive order, active until 7:30 Monday night, banning all vehicles and pedestrians from roads in the town of Highland.\n\nHochul said she spoke to the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator and that “she has offered all the help necessary.” First steps are to assess damage and the costs to repair.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan, U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer and Sen. Gillibrand announced mid-day Monday that they were seeking a major disaster declaration for the state from the FEMA.\n\n“There’s no time to wait,” Ryan, D-18th District, said in a statement. “FEMA must activate their Disaster Assessment Teams and prepare to fulfill any and all requests from New York State for additional assistance.”\n\nA federal disaster declaration would open up grants and assistance to state and local governments and nonprofits and reimburse certain repair costs.\n\nWith more rain expected Monday, the federal representatives urged quick action by FEMA.\n\n“This loss of life and extensive damage to homes, businesses, and transportation infrastructure is devastating and will likely total tens of millions of dollars in costs suffered taking months and months to repair, according to my early discussion with those on the ground,” Schumer said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mike Lawler, whose district includes Rockland, Putnam and parts of Westchester, called for quick action on federal emergency status. \"The damage across the Hudson Valley is significant and we need to keep the ball rolling here,\" the Republican said.\n\nOne for the books\n\nThe West Point-Highland Falls area was particularly hard hit. The Red Cross's Hudson Valley Chapter opened a shelter at the Sacred Heart of Jesus School at 7 Cozzens Ave. in Highland Falls. Volunteers are providing a place to rest, water and snacks, the agency said on Twitter.\n\nNicholas Bassill, University of Albany director of research and development, where the New York State Mesonet tracks real-time weather data from 126 field stations, said that, in addition to the West Point area getting walloped, Sunday's storm was one for the books.\n\nIn Somers, it broke rainfall records that go back to 2021's Hurricane Ida. The record for rainfall over 24 hours was 5.30 inches. Sunday's storm brought 5.96 inches. The record for rainfall in one hour was 1.59 inches. Sunday's storm brought 2.17 inches to Somers.\n\nHochul said the storm appeared to be moving east and that it's not expected to deliver the level of damage in other parts of New York that occurred Sunday into Monday.\n\nRockland County EMS Coordinator Desiree Leon-Stoll also serves as president of the Stony Point Ambulance Corps. She said Stony Point responded to help rescue a group of Appalachian trail hikers near Perkins Memorial Tower on Sunday, including two who sustained significant injuries after they were swept off the trail by flash flooding. It took four hours for volunteer EMS staff to get them out, and then one had to be evacuated in the bed of a pick-up truck, she said. Both were taken to Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla.\n\nSignificant damage was found around Rockland's Stony Point, where roads turned into rushing rivers in some places. Journal News/lohud video showed an inundated section of Lowland Hill Road, with rescue personnel using a boat to evacuate residents of flooded homes. Charles S. Eccher Park on Lowland Hill Road was flooded Sunday.\n\nRichard Beyer and Cindy Beyer, who own the two homes that flooded when Cedar Brook rose across from the park, said Piermont firefighters took him out by boat. “We didn’t think the water would go super high,” Richard Beyer said.\n\nHe said the brook hadn’t risen so high since Hurricane Irene in 2011 and Floyd before that. By Monday afternoon, it was already receding.\n\nOn Monday, Stony Point Parks and Recreation cleared debris from the park grounds.\n\nRockland County Legislator Doug Jobson, R-Stony Point, anticipated that the town's summer camp would be able to use parts of Eccher Park, also known as Lowland Park, by Tuesday.\n\nBehind Yorktown Town Hall, a sinkhole\n\nIn Yorktown, in Westchester, Town Supervisor Tom Diana declared a state of emergency Monday, launching a process to seek emergency aid from the county, state and federal governments. He said damage included a sinkhole behind Town Hall, compromised culverts -- conduits that carry an open drain or stream beneath roads -- boulders on roads, and washed out roads.\n\n\"It got so bad to the point where Mohegan Fire Department lost a firetruck trying to respond to a scene, and it was compromised by the high water on one of the roadways,\" Diana said at a news conference Monday.\n\nIn the Jefferson Valley hamlet, the recently renovated municipal golf course, which town officials just held a grand opening for on Saturday, is \"underwater,\" Police Chief Robert Noble said at the news conference. \"I mean, it's horrible what's happened in some sections of town.\"\n\nDiana's advice to the public echoed other officials: If you think you can drive through an area of road covered in water, don't do it -- you don't know what's underneath it.\n\n\"Turn around, and get out of there, because we don't know that the road is not compromised undeneath,\" Diana said. \"There are numerous wash-outs that underneath the roadways ... the roadways are buckling and/or buckled, which means that there's a possible wash out underneath them.\"\n\nMore than six inches of rain fell on the town, Diana said in a statement.\n\n“As the water recedes, I’m sure we’re going to find more damage,\" Diana said.\n\nNoble said many Yorktown roads were affected. The police were working with an auto body shop to remove about six abandoned vehicles from a stretch of the closed-down Route 202 corridor, between Old Crompond Road and Lexington Avenue.\n\nA culvert on Old Crompond Road, where it runs between Linette Court and Mill Pond Road, \"has been significantly compromised,\" Noble said, and the town's highway department was at that scene \"where we're concerned about that culvert collapsing.\"\n\nYorktown parks and recreation programs are canceled Monday and municipal pools closed. The town camps are expected to resume and one pool reopen on Tuesday. The Shrub Oak pool may not reopen Tuesday due to the flooding in the town's north end.\n\nGarbage and recycling will be collected Monday on streets deemed passable. If a street is closed or unpassable, collection attempts will be tried later in the day.\n\nRoads still closed\n\nRoad closures continued into Monday, including the Palisades Interstate Parkway north of Exit 14 in Stony Point; a section of Route 6/Long Mountain Parkway; the westbound Bear Mountain Bridge; portions of Route 9W, including the Popelopen Bridge on 9W in Town of Highlands; the Wesley Chapel Road between Spook Rock and Route 202; and Cedar Flats Road in Stony Point.\n\nState Police Spokesman Trooper Steven Nevel said early Monday: \"Everything is a hard closure now, but we still have residual flooding and debris in the roadway. Our aviation is up right now, getting an assessment of the area. I couldn't give you a 'this road is open,' because it could be open but then be closed in the next 10 or 15 minutes.\"\n\nSunday's flash flooding left motorists stranded along low-lying stretches of the Palisades Interstate Parkway, with troopers helping dozens of people and asking all others to avoid the area. The northbound Parkway was closed from Exit 14 to the Long Mountain traffic circle.\n\nThere have been ramp closures due to flooding. As of 6 a.m. Monday, the exit 7A northbound ramp from the New York State Thruway to the Saw Mill River Parkway was closed at the Department of Transportation's request, spokeswoman Jennifer Givner said.\n\nIn Yorktown, in Westchester, the police said Monday these are closed:\n\n∎Route 6 north between Perry and Wood streets\n\n∎Wood Street between Mountain Road and the Putnam County line\n\n∎East Main Street between Pine Cour and Barger Street\n\n∎Barger Street between East Main Street and Route 6\n\n∎New Road\n\n∎Old Crompond Road between Linette Court and Mill Pond Road\n\n∎White Hill Road between Hunterbrook Road and William Court\n\n∎Brookside Avenue\n\n∎Breenwood Street between Brookside Avenue and Veterans Road\n\n∎Mohegan Avenue between Route 6 and Sagamore Avenue\n\n∎Brook Lane\n\n∎North Ridge Road\n\n∎Robin Road\n\n∎Granite Springs Road between Headwig Drive and Gregory Street\n\n∎Crompond Road between Ready Refresh and The Taconic Vet -- 3655-3787 Crompond Rd)\n\nFatal fire:Could judge in Evergreen Court case toss DA's plea deal, order jail?\n\nIn Cornwall, in Orange County, the town's Office of Emergency Management said on Facebook these roads were closed as of 7 a.m. and that the closures \"are for the foreseable future\":\n\n∎Route 9W south between Cornwall and Highlands\n\n∎Route 32 north and south between Cornwall and Woodbury\n\n∎Route 218 north and south between Cornwall and Highlands\n\n∎Route 6 from Route 32 and Route 17 in Central Valley to the Long Mountain Traffic Circle\n\n∎The Palisades Interstate Parkway from Bear Mountain Bridge to exit 14\n\n∎The Bear Mountain Bridge, westbound traffic\n\n∎The Popolopen Bridge/Route 9w north from Bear Mountain Circle in town of Highlands\n\n∎Bear Mountain State Park.\n\nState police said in a statement Sunday they had assisted dozens of motorists and were doing a check of all remaining vehicles in the area “to ensure that there is no one stranded or left behind.”\n\nCSX freight tracks were compromised in about 10 places, Neuhaus said. Sites along CSX track between Selkirk, New York and New Jersey were washed out.

It’s going to do that to us, as well. Water management is probably one of the most difficult things to do.”\n\nThe park, established privately in 1916, only becoming a state park in 2007, has endured many rock slides in recent years that have forced closures, including a major collapse of a retaining wall in October at the upper parking lot, where visitors pull in to start the Outcroppings Trail leading to the summit of the Chimney, or access a network of other trails, including the recently renovated Skyline Trail.\n\nIt is also the access area for the 258-foot elevator to the Chimney, which has been out of order for a couple of years, and slated to open this summer, and the Cliff Dweller’s Gift Shop and Sky Lounge.\n\nThe wall 'just fell over'\n\nThe slide sent massive amounts of road, debris, rock and asphalt down a steep slope landing close to the Hickory Nut Falls Trailhead, closing the park for about two weeks in the height of fall foliage season.\n\nAfter stabilization work by the N.C. Department of Transportation, the park reopened in late October and shuttled visitors to the upper parking lot from the lower, Meadows parking area.\n\n“We put barricades around it and we were monitoring the wall. Per DOT, they told us if it starts to rain hard, look for movement,” Ledgerwood said. “On May 19 we noticed there was movement. It had been raining a lot and the ground in that parking area started to sink. We evacuated the park, and closed it until May 21.”\n\nThe park reopened briefly, but the rain from tropical storm Alberto continued. On May 26, the wall continued to move, staff evacuated the park again, and then it did collapse.\n\nThe October collapse was about 35 feet tall. The May 26 collapse, just further along the wall, was 12-15 feet. “It just fell over. The energy behind it wasn’t as strong as first one,” he said.\n\nBut the water kept coming, filling the Rocky Broad River to overflowing with debris washed down from a collapse May 30 on the other side of Hickory Nut Gorge in Chimney Rock Village, and piled up 1 and ½ feet of water and dirt in front of the park’s entrance gate, Ledgerwood said.\n\nTaking care of 'boulder issues'\n\nThat day, water took out “half the road” just past the bridge inside the park entrance, on the river side across from the Chimney Rock LLC offices.\n\n“A crew came in to tip over any boulders in that collapsed area, lay them flat, so there is no chance they can continue to roll. On the Hickory Nut Falls Trail a boulder the size of a pickup truck came down across the middle of the trail,” he said.\n\n“So far, we’ve had a contractor in the park to handle any imminent boulder issues and we’ve been working with DOT and N.C. Geological Service to evaluate these areas before reopening.”\n\nThe heavy rains of Alberto also caused heavy damage to the town of Chimney Rock, and drew a visit from Gov. Roy Cooper.\n\nA long history of questionable road building\n\nThe collapsed road in the park has been stabilized, but is still a sagging mess, and all traffic is reduced to one lane.\n\nThe blame goes not only to water, but to construction practices of the time, Ledgerwood said. In the late 1940s, a 198-foot tunnel and 258-foot elevator shaft were blasted through the mountain, to provide easier access for visitors to the Chimney Rock. It took 8 tons of dynamite and 18 months to complete, according to park records.\n\n“All the rocks and boulders they blasted in a 250-foot shaft were taken out the bottom and dumped over the side. That’s what they buried and put a parking lot on top and built a retaining wall. It gets a lot of water, a lot of drainage through there,” he said.\n\nThe park’s 2011 master plan calls building a second entrance road in the Lake Lure area for accommodate the 250,000 or so visitors each year, and eventually closing the 3-mile park road.\n\nBut Ledgerwood said the project has no immediate ETA since it involves purchasing private land.\n\nThe immediate plan is to hire a contractor through the NCDOT to stabilize the slope at the upper parking lot, to allow cars in. He said he estimates total damage to the park infrastructure at about $300,000.\n\nImpact on the visitors and the workforce\n\nAll the closings have taken a toll on visitors and the workforce, said Mary Jaeger-Gale, general manager of Chimney Rock LLC, which manages the attraction side of the park, where there is an entrance fee, and the Old Rock Café at the park’s entrance. The Rumbling Bald hiking and climbing area has no entrance fee.\n\n“Our biggest concern is the safety of our guests and keeping our folks working. The state has been awesome helping us work around storm damage until we get it repaired,” she said.\n\nWhile the state park only has eight full-time staff, Chimney Rock LLC employs some 60 people, from naturalists, to maintenance to gift shop workers.\n\nMany were not able to get in to work during the closures of U.S. 64 and Chimney Rock Road, and others had no jobs to do for weeks, but Jaeger-Gale said everyone is back to work this week.\n\nThe park is holding a Father’s Day special this weekend – dad or granddad gets in free June 16 and 17 with the purchase of a regular adult ticket found online, she said.\n\nChimney Rock Village will hold a community clean up day from 8 a.m.-noon June 8 and is asking for volunteers to clean, clear and repair the Rocky Broad Riverwalk, which was heavily damaged and lost a bridge in the storm.\n\n“The Rocky Broad brought a lot of debris down the river and closed Lake Lure. The tour boats and barges had to pull debris out of the lake before could open boat access,” Jaeger-Gale said.\n\n“When something happens to one of us in the gorge, it happens to all of us. But we’re optimistic. July 4 is coming up, and we’re anticipating getting the elevator running soon to help the folks who can’t walk the 500 steps to the Chimney.”\n\nFor more park updates, visit www.chimneyrockpark.com.\n\nMore WNC and outdoors stories:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/world/rocket-moon-impact-crater-scn/index.html", "title": "New double crater seen on the moon after mystery rocket impact ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe moon has a new double crater after a rocket body collided with its surface on March 4.\n\nNew images shared by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been circling the moon since 2009, have revealed the location of the unusual crater.\n\nThe impact created two craters that overlap, an eastern crater measuring 59 feet (18 meters) across and a western crater spanning 52.5 feet (16 meters). Together, they create a depression that is roughly 91.8 feet (28 meters) wide in the longest dimension.\n\nA rocket body hit the moon on March 4, creating a double crater, as indicated by the white arrow. NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nAlthough astronomers expected the impact after discovering that the rocket part was on track to collide with the moon, the double crater it created was a surprise.\n\nTypically, spent rockets have the most mass at the motor end because the rest of the rocket is largely just an empty fuel tank. But the double crater suggests that this object had large masses at both ends when it hit the moon.\n\nThe exact origin of the rocket body, a piece of space junk that had been careening around for years, is unclear, so the double crater could help astronomers determine what it was.\n\nThe moon lacks a protective atmosphere, so it’s littered with craters created when objects like asteroids regularly slam into the surface.\n\nThis was the first time a piece of space junk unintentionally hit the lunar surface that experts know of. But craters have resulted from spacecraft being deliberately crashed into the moon.\n\nThe new crater is smaller than others and not visible in this view, but its location is indicated by the white arrow. NASA/Goddard/Arizona State University\n\nFor example, four large moon craters attributed to the Apollo 13, 14, 15 and 17 missions are all much larger than each of the overlapping craters created during the March 4 impact. However, the maximum width of the new double crater is similar to the Apollo craters.\n\nUnclear origin\n\nBill Gray, an independent researcher focused on orbital dynamics and the developer of astronomical software, was first to spot the trajectory of the rocket booster.\n\nGray had initially identified it as the SpaceX Falcon rocket stage that launched the US Deep Space Climate Observatory, or DSCOVR, in 2015 but later said he’d gotten that wrong and it was likely from a 2014 Chinese lunar mission – an assessment NASA agreed with.\n\nHowever, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the booster was from its Chang’e-5 moon mission, saying that the rocket in question burned up on reentry to Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nNo agencies systematically track space debris so far away from Earth, and the confusion over the origin of the rocket stage has underscored the need for official agencies to monitor deep-space junk more closely, rather than relying on the limited resources of private individuals and academics.\n\nHowever, experts say that the bigger challenge is the space debris in low-Earth orbit, an area where it can collide with functioning satellites, create more junk and threaten human life on crewed spacecraft.\n\nThere are at least 26,000 pieces of space junk orbiting Earth that are the size of a softball or larger and could destroy a satellite on impact; over 500,000 objects the size of a marble – big enough to cause damage to spacecraft or satellites; and over 100 million pieces the size of a grain of salt, tiny debris that could nonetheless puncture a spacesuit, according to a NASA report issued last year.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Katie Hunt", "Ashley Strickland", "Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/03/02/rocket-companies-united-wholesale-mortgage-shed-jobs/69965035007/", "title": "Rocket Companies, United Wholesale Mortgage shed thousands of ...", "text": "The nation's top two mortgage lenders — both headquartered in metro Detroit — shed thousands of jobs as the mortgage business lurched from boom times to an industrywide slump, according to newly released corporate filings.\n\nDan Gilbert's Rocket Companies, the Detroit-based corporate parent of Rocket Mortgage, formerly known as Quicken Loans, cut its employee headcount to about 18,500 people as of Dec. 31, down from 26,000 a year earlier.\n\nDuring the same period, Pontiac-based United Wholesale Mortgage shrunk its headcount, from 8,000 to about 6,000.\n\nThose employment figures were cited this week in once-a-year disclosures that the publicly traded companies filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe plummeting headcounts at Rocket and UWM underscore the cyclical nature of the mortgage business and that potential impact on the local economy, considering the industry's No. 1 and No. 2 lenders are based here.\n\nNearly all of UWM's workforce is situated at the company's corporate campus in Pontiac, where employees walk between buildings — and above South Boulevard — on the longest enclosed pedestrian bridge in the world.\n\nRocket is headquartered in downtown Detroit and much of its workforce resides in the region. It is considered the largest employer in the city of Detroit. Still, its workers are geographically more spread out than UWM's.\n\nAccording to SEC filings, Rocket Companies has a network of 16 corporate offices, 11 \"client support locations\" and four call centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Some of those offices are for portfolio companies under the Rocket Companies umbrella that don't write mortgages, such as Rock Connections, Rocket Auto and Rocket Money, formerly known as Truebill.\n\nMore:Gilbert's Rocket Companies reports first quarterly loss since going public\n\nMore:Michigan nonprofits hit hard by pandemic can access $35M grant fund: Here's how\n\nRocket and UWM have felt the downturn in the mortgage business that began in late 2021 and sped up in early 2022 as interest rates rose, home sales slowed and mortgage refinancing activity dried up.\n\nThe end of the 2020-21 refinancing boom was especially painful for Rocket, as it did a lot of refinancings and refinancings can be very profitable. Last year, Rocket originated $133 billion worth of mortgages, a 62% decline from 2021. The firm's net income, or profit, for 2022 was $700 million, versus $6.1 billion in 2021.\n\nFor the past two quarters, UWM has originated more mortgages than Rocket, snatching what had been Rocket's crown as the nation's No. 1 mortgage lender. Rocket had held that title since 2018, when it surpassed Wells Fargo.\n\nUWM says its reduction in headcount resulted from less hiring and regular “attrition,” not layoffs.\n\nThe Pontiac company this week reported $932 million in net income, or profit, for all of 2022, compared with $1.6 billion in 2021.\n\nRacing to cut\n\nRocket, which this week reported its first quarterly loss since going public in 2020, has been racing to cut expenses amid the falling revenues.\n\nThose cuts have included a 24% year-over-year reduction in marketing and advertising and 17% reduction in salaries, commissions and employee benefits, according to the SEC filings.\n\nRocket did incur $81 million in extra costs in 2022 related to doing employee buyouts.\n\nDuring an earnings call Tuesday, Rocket Chief Financial Officer Brian Brown seemed to indicate that the company expects to keep headcount about where it currently is. Industry insiders often refer to workforce size as \"capacity.\"\n\n“As we think about capacity, we think we are in a good spot right now. We think we are ready for the homebuying seasons,\" Brown said.\n\nA Rocket representative did not respond Thursday to a request for comment about its workforce reductions.\n\nAs for UWM, company CEO Mat Ishbia has repeatedly said that UWM has never done layoffs and never will.\n\n\"Based on market conditions, we no longer need to hire aggressively to grow our business and support our clients,\" a company spokesperson said Thursday in a written statement. \"Through natural attrition, for various reasons — relocation, a family commitment, new opportunity, etc. — our team member count has balanced out. It’s important to note that our hiring classes now include 50-100 new team members, where before it was 400-500.\"\n\nFor years, another nationally ranked mortgage lender in metro Detroit was Troy-based Flagstar Bank.Flagstar was acquired late last year by New York Community Bancorp, which plans to rebrand the entire bank with the Flagstar name.\n\nIn January, the bank announced that it had restructured its mortgage division and laid off 10% of all bank employees, including some in metro Detroit, because of the nationwide downtown in the mortgage business.\n\nFlagstar's mortgage division had fewer than 800 employees after the restructuring announcement, compared with 2,100 in 2021, the company said.\n\nAnother publicly traded local mortgage lender, Ann Arbor-based Home Point Financial, has done several staff reductions since 2021 and is scheduled to release its full 2022 earnings March 9.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/02"}]}

But just minutes later, a federal judge in Washington, Obama appointee U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice, ordered the Food and Drug Administration not to make any changes that would restrict access to the drug in 17 states and D.C. that sued to expand access to mifepristone.\n\nThe consequences of the rulings, at least in the short term, will be that access to mifepristone remains unchanged, because Kacsmaryk gave seven days for the federal government to appeal, which the Justice Department has committed to do.\n\nThe legal battle seems destined for argument before the nation's Supreme Court Justices, an upcoming challenge that is worrying abortion rights advocates about access to a drug long hailed as safe by federal regulators.\n\n\"FDA is under one order that says you can do nothing and another that says in seven days I’m going to require you to vacate the approval of mifepristone,\" said Glenn Cohen of Harvard Law School.\n\nKacsmaryk's ruling in Texas means health care providers could be barred from prescribing mifepristone, even in states where abortion is legal. In-clinic, procedural abortion care will not be affected by the ruling.\n\nA coalition led by the conservative legal advocacy organization Alliance Defending Freedom in November filed a federal lawsuit in Amarillo, Texas, arguing the drug comes with medical risks and should be pulled from the market. Kacsmaryk in Texas sided with anti-abortion groups in the case.\n\nAbortion access advocates said the ruling could have severe consequences on people’s ability to access abortion and miscarriage care, especially after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhat does the ruling to pause FDA approval mean?\n\nKacsmaryk ordered the FDA to stay mifepristone's approval as the lawsuit continues. He did not go as far as plaintiffs wanted by immediately withdrawing FDA approval for the drug.\n\nStill, it could affect medication abortion access for about 64.5 million women of reproductive age nationwide, according to an analysis released Feb. 10 by NARAL Pro-Choice America.\n\nLorie Chaiten, senior staff attorney at the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, said the ruling could \"create an unprecedented disruption to healthcare access.\"\n\nThe decision \"will unleash a public health crisis by removing health care options for millions of people,\" said Jenny Ma, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nThe Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative group that brought the lawsuit, celebrated the ruling out of Texas on Friday.\n\n\"This is a significant victory for the doctors and medical associations we represent and more importantly, the health and safety of women and girls,\" Senior Counsel Erik Baptist said.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris warned it could set a precedent impacting Americans' ability to access medication prescribed by their doctors.\n\n\"Simply put: this decision undermines the FDA’s ability to approve safe and effective medications—from chemotherapy drugs, to asthma medicine, to blood pressure pills, to insulin—based on science, not politics,\" Harris said in a statement.\n\nWhat is mifepristone and medication abortion?\n\nEven before the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the constitutional right to abortion granted by Roe v. Wade, medication abortion accounted for more than half of all abortions in the United States, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights.\n\nThe FDA approved mifepristone for medication abortion in 2000. The drug is typically taken in a two-step regimen along with another medication called misoprostol. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists call mifepristone a safe and effective abortion medication and a component of treatment and management for early pregnancy loss or miscarriage.\n\n\"The court’s disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation,\" American Medical Association President Dr. Jack Resneck Jr. said.\n\nWhat could happen next?\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what the immediate impact of dueling rulings from federal judges would be, but advocates say the situation breeds \"chaos and confusion.\"\n\n\"My administration will fight this ruling,\" President Joe Biden said of the Texas decision. \"The lawsuit, and this ruling, is another unprecedented step in taking away basic freedoms from women and putting their health at risk.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Justice Department \"strongly disagrees\" with the ruling from Texas and will appeal it, and is reviewing the decision from Washington.\n\nThe ruling from the District Court for the Northern District of Texas \"overturns the FDA’s expert judgment, rendered over two decades ago, that mifepristone is safe and effective. The Department will continue to defend the FDA’s decision,\" Garland said.\n\nEvan Masingill, CEO of GenBioPro, the manufacturer of mifepristone, said the company is reviewing both rulings and will continue to make the drug available.\n\n\"Nothing in the court's order (in Texas) changes the decades of science and evidence regarding mifepristone's safety and efficacy,\" Masingill said.\n\nWhile the FDA could choose to restart the approval process if an effort to revoke approval succeeds, this may take years, Chaiten said.\n\nIn a statement, NARAL Pro-Choice America said the two competing rulings will almost certainly end up before the Supreme Court.\n\nFiling lawsuit in Amarillo part of legal strategy\n\nSeveral legal experts said it was no accident the complaint was filed in Amarillo, Texas, where the only judge is Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who has a history of conservative rulings.\n\n\"This is one single judge in Texas, a state that has already banned abortion, deciding the medication abortion access of every single person across the country,\" Ma said.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom, which filed the suit, is considered an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The group told USA TODAY it \"categorically rejects\" this classification, calling it a \"deliberate mischaracterization of our work.\"\n\nProviders rush to consider misoprostol-only options\n\nProviders nationwide are rushing to shift to misoprostol-only protocols for medication abortions, and clinics have already begun ordering more misoprostol supplies, said Ashley Brink, clinic director at Trust Women Kansas in Wichita.\n\nShe said misoprostol-only methods have been used globally for years as \"a safe and effective alternative\" to using both mifepristone and misoprostol.\n\nStudies show misoprostol-only methods are less effective than the two-step regimen.\n\nRuling to hit marginalized communities hardest\n\nLow-income and people of color could be disproportionately impacted by Kacsmaryk's ruling, experts say. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis showed about 67% of U.S. abortion seekers were non-white.\n\nTerri-Ann Thompson, senior researcher at Ibis Reproductive Health, said the ruling disregards patient preference, cost and travel burdens of marginalized communities.\n\n\"One of the reasons, among many, that people actually choose a medication abortion is because it is the less costly option of the abortion options available,\" she said. \"It's a racial justice issue and economic disadvantage is at the root.\"\n\nLupe Rodríguez, executive director at the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice, said many immigrant women are accustomed to medication abortion and prefer it.\n\n— Nada Hassanein, USA TODAY\n\nContributing: John Fritze, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/health/abortion-texas-sepsis/index.html", "title": "Texas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAnother woman has come forward with the harrowing details of how the Supreme Court’s decision four months ago to overturn Roe v. Wade put her life in danger.\n\nCNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.\n\nNow, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nThe loss of a ‘miracle’ baby\n\nAmanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.\n\n“Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.\n\nThree years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.\n\nThey tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped.

Death row inmate Roy Ward is challenging that process, arguing there is a lack of oversight in who picks what is in the \"drug cocktail\" that would be used to execute him.\n\nWard's attorney, Frank David, told IndyStar he is concerned that the lethal drug is chosen by prison officials, not elected officials, and there is no opportunity for the public to comment.\n\n\"I think everyone would agree that the execution of an individual is a serious matter,\" David said. \"When it comes to the ultimate deprivation of someone's liberty, the public should know what unelected officials are doing to choose these deadly cocktails.\n\n\"Right now there is no oversight in these decisions.\"\n\nInitially, the Department of Correction chose a three-drug cocktail — called Brevital — that has not been used in any state or federal execution.\n\nBut that's now a moot point. During oral arguments, Indiana Attorney General Chief Counsel Stephen Creason told the court that the DOC would not be using Brevital to execute prisoners.\n\nStill, there is an important issue to be resolved.\n\n“The question going forward,\" Creason posed to the justices, \"is what will the department need to do whenever it identifies a new execution procedure?\"\n\nWard, who was convicted in the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County, is one of 12 people on death row in Indiana.\n\nThe Indiana Court of Appeals sided with him in June, when the court ruled that the death penalty protocol adopted in May 2014 was unconstitutional and thus “void and without effect.”\n\nThe Supreme Court unanimously decided last month to weigh in on the appeal.\n\nSupreme Court Justices Steven H.

At least 10 states have effectively banned abortion since Friday’s ruling.\n\nIn all, 26 states have laws that indicate they could outlaw or set extreme limits on abortions, effectively banning abortion in those states, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThree states – Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota – had so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically with the Supreme Court’s reversal Friday of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling which established a constitutional right to an abortion. Other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nOklahoma, which had recently put in place a law banning most abortions, has also taken the step of implementing its trigger ban, according to the state attorney general’s office. Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge also certified the state’s trigger ban, allowing it to take effect Friday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced.\n\nUtah’s trigger ban went into effect Friday, according to a letter sent by John L. Fellows, the general counsel for the Utah Legislature, which was provided to CNN by KUTV. And on Saturday, Planned Parenthood of Utah filed a lawsuit seeking to block it.\n\nOther states have prohibitions on abortion that had been blocked by courts that had cited Roe’s guarantee of a right to abortion. Those states may act quickly to have those court orders lifted so those restrictions can go into effect.\n\nOhio Attorney General David Yost announced Friday the injunction blocking the state’s so-called heartbeat bill, which bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected – as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant – was dissolved. In court documents, US District Judge Michael Barrett said he sided with Yost in dissolving the injunction, but noted the court “declines to dismiss this case at this juncture. Rather, a status conference will be set by separate notice to discuss further proceedings.”\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey referenced a court order which halted the state’s 2019 abortion ban and said in a statement Alabama “will immediately ask the court to strike down any legal barriers to enforcing this law.” A federal judge in Alabama on Friday granted an emergency motion to end an injunction against Alabama’s ban after the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nStates including Wisconsin and West Virginia had abortion restrictions before the Roe ruling that had never been removed.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Republican-controlled state legislature declined Wednesday to repeal an 1849 state law banning abortion during a special session called by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers – allowing it to take effect again after the high court overturned Roe.\n\n“We will fight this decision in every way we can with every power we have,” Evers said in a written statement.\n\nWisconsin Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul told CNN affiliate WISN before the court’s decision came down he did not intend to enforce the abortion ban at the state level. However, following the decision Friday, his office issued a statement stopping short of that, saying, “Our office is reviewing today’s decision and will be providing further information about how we intend to move forward next week.”\n\nAt the same time, just across Wisconsin’s eastern border, the state of Minnesota is preparing for a potential influx of women seeking abortions as bans in other states go into effect. Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Saturday designed to shield women seeking abortions there from being subject to legal consequences in other states.\n\nBans expected soon\n\nStates with trigger laws expected to ban abortions in the upcoming days and weeks include Wyoming, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and Idaho.\n\nTennessee Attorney General Herbert H. Slatery III said in addition to implementing the trigger ban set to go into effect in 30 days, the state had asked an appeals court to lift a hold which had been placed on a measure banning abortion at around six weeks into pregnancy.\n\nIn Texas, where the trigger ban is to be implemented on the 30th day after the Supreme Court issues its judgment (a court move which will happen in the coming weeks), Attorney General Ken Paxton has announced local prosecutors may now begin enforcing an abortion ban passed by the state before the Roe ruling. (Texas had already effectively banned abortion when it enacted a six-week ban last year.)\n\nIt’s likely elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nIndiana’s Republican Gov. Eric J. Holcomb is calling for a return of the General Assembly on July 6, so legislators can consider anti-abortion legislation.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more clearly describe when Texas’ trigger ban will take effect.

In fact, it’s just the opposite: The fight is over whether the state must reveal who supplies the drugs Indiana plans to use to administer the death penalty.\n\nSome drug companies don't want their drugs used for executions, others don't want their names disclosed for fear of public shaming, making it difficult for Indiana and other states to acquire the drugs needed for executions.\n\nLegal experts say ramifications of the case could extend from the state's Death Row to Wall Street to the pockets of Hoosier taxpayers, who could be on the hook for hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees.\n\nThere is no indication when the state's highest court will issue a ruling, but the deliberations come at a time of heightened awareness about the death penalty in Indiana.\n\nDeath Row: Here are the 8 men facing the death penalty in Indiana\n\nThe federal government had planned to resume executions next week at the U.S. Penitentiary in Terre Haute, but their status remains in limbo due to last-minute legal challenges. Those executions — initially scheduled for Monday, Wednesday and Friday — are not governed by state law but, as potentially the first executions on Indiana soil since 2009, they draw renewed attention to an issue that has divided Americans for decades.\n\nAttorney General William P. Barr last month directed the Federal Bureau of Prisons to schedule executions of four federal inmates convicted of murdering children. Last July, Barr directed the BOP to revise its lethal injection protocol to the use of a single-drug, pentobarbital. That order was upheld by appellate courts, clearing the way for a wave of executions scheduled between Monday and Aug. 28.\n\nThe legal fight over the identities of the state's suppliers of death penalty drugs now before the Indiana Supreme Court is just the latest twist in a long, tangled dispute that started six years ago with a public records request.\n\nMore than a decade since last execution\n\nIndiana has executed 94 prisoners since 1897. The first 13 were by hanging. The state switched to the electric chair in 1914 and since 1996 has used lethal injection. All of those executed were men. The youngest 18. The oldest 64. Nineteen have met their fate by lethal injection.\n\nBut the Indiana Department of Correction's last execution was more than a decade ago: Matthew Eric Wrinkles, a 49-year-old Evansville man who murdered his estranged wife and two for her relatives in 1994, was put to death by a lethal mix of drugs Dec. 11, 2009.\n\nMORE: Woman discovers family tie to Indiana's electric chair\n\nIn Indiana, eight men are currently facing state death penalties handed down by Hoosier judges. They are held in individual cells in what is known as X Row at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City.\n\nUnlike the federal government, Indiana's lethal injection process uses a cocktail that includes an anesthetic, a paralytic agent and a chemical to stop the heart. At this time, Indiana does not have any executions scheduled. And the lawsuit has revealed why.\n\n\"It's not that there aren't prisoners on Death Row. It's just that we don't have the drugs to conform to the statute and regulations that we need,\" explained Solicitor General Thomas M. Fisher, who is representing the state in the legal case.\n\nIndiana is not alone in that predicament. The ability to acquire drugs for executions is a nationwide issue with no clear resolution in sight. Some drug makers and distributors don't want their products associated with executions. Others just want to avoid negative publicity or protests by death penalty opponents.\n\nFisher said the difficulty Indiana has had in procuring death penalty drugs could be exacerbated by a Supreme Court order requiring IDOC to identify its drug suppliers.\n\nSecrecy slipped into Indiana law\n\nThe case now before the Supreme Court started in 2014 when A. Katherine \"Kate\" Toomey, a Washington, D.C., attorney who represents groups opposing the death penalty, asked the IDOC to identify the manufacturers, distributors and suppliers of drugs for its execution protocol.\n\nToomey's request came just days after a news report in which an IDOC spokesman identified a new combination the state planned to use in the wake of a shortage of thiopental sodium, which had been the sedative component. The spokesman said it would be replaced by Brevital, a barbiturate anesthetic, in a mix that also included pancuronium bromide and potassium chloride.\n\nThe IDOC denied Toomey's request, citing a statute that says \"the identities of persons who assist the warden of the state prison in an execution” are confidential and excluded from the Access to Public Records Act.\n\nOver the next three years, the legal wrangling wound through the Indiana Public Access Counselor, Marion Circuit Court and Indiana Court of Appeals before landing at the Indiana Supreme Court. Toomey prevailed at every stop and, while IDOC did provide some information, her request for manufacturer and supplier names was not fulfilled.\n\nIn April 2017, as the Supreme Court was considering the state's request to hear a challenge to a Marion Circuit Court ruling, officials launched a late-night end run to circumvent the ruling. It was the last day of the General Assembly's session. As lawmakers hammered out final details of the biennial budget bill, working into the wee hours, an unrelated provision was quietly tacked on without public notice or a hearing.\n\nThe last-minute add-on — crafted with the help of IDOC and the governor's office, according to court records — changed Indiana law to specifically say contracts to acquire drugs for executions and the identities of manufacturers or suppliers is confidential and not subject to disclosure. Lawmakers made the change retroactive to cover \"any request for information, discovery request, or proceeding, no matter when made or initiated.\"\n\nThe bill was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb on April 27, 2017 — the same day the Supreme Court declined to hear IDOC's appeal.\n\nBuoyed by the new law, the state asked Marion Circuit Judge Sheryl Lynch to reconsider her ruling in favor of Toomey. But Lynch wasn't swayed. She ruled IDOC had not established the drugs were procured through a contract. In addition, she found the new law violated several constitutional principles. That included separation of powers and freedom of speech, because it prohibited individuals outside state government, such as drug manufacturers or suppliers, from providing the information.\n\nLynch also ordered the state to pay Toomey more than $500,000 in attorney fees, citing the state's “egregious” conduct in pushing the legislative work-around.\n\nThe state then appealed to the Supreme Court.\n\nDwindling supplies of execution drugs\n\nThe case essentially comes down to one simple question: Is the supplier information part of the public record? But to answer that, the court also may have to weigh in on the constitutionality of the 2017 legislative change.\n\nMore than 30 state and national news organizations, including The Indianapolis Star, have filed \"friend of the court\" briefs in support of Toomey's case for making the information public.\n\nRepresented by Fisher and other lawyers from the Attorney General's office, the state contends \"the lack of confidentiality has made it increasingly difficult for states to carry out lawfully imposed sentences.\"\n\nWhen death penalty opponents learn the identity of drug suppliers, the state argued, the critics publicly shame the companies into refusing to provide drugs for executions. Court documents cite several instances of companies pulling out across the U.S. Two examples are from Indiana:\n\nAfter the IDOC spokesman revealed in 2014 the department planned to begin using Brevital, the maker announced it would take steps to prevent distribution to departments of correction.\n\nA former prison warden approached a vendor in 2015 to supply execution drugs, promising the vendor confidentiality. The vendor initially agreed, but later withdrew due to “public pressure” on makers supplying execution drugs.\n\n\"As a result of the growing difficulty of servicing drugs, since 2010, most states have had to 'scramble' to acquire sufficient supplies to carry out executions, resulting in several delayed executions across the country,\" the state argued.\n\nToomey is represented by a team of attorneys led by Peter M. Racher of the Indianapolis law firm Plews Shadley Racher & Braun.\n\n\"You would think that the state would be supportive of a citizen request to know as much as possible about the materials that Indiana is using to carry out the death penalty,\" Racher said. \"Where are they coming from? How do we know these materials are going to do their intended function?\"\n\nRacher said the information also is important to public discussion about the death penalty and in fostering public confidence that a future attempt here will not be \"a botched execution like we've seen in some other states.\"\n\nHe was referring to 2014 executions in Ohio and Oklahoma, where the condemned men lingered — and appeared to be suffering — for more than 20 and 40 minutes, respectively, after receiving lethal injections.\n\n\"I would think the governor and the Department of Correction would be very interested in avoiding all of that,\" Racher said. \"They want to make sure that the death penalty is complied with constitutionally. We don't want to implement a death penalty that is in violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.\"\n\nEven court victory is no guarantee\n\nIndiana is far from alone in trying to protect the identities of death penalty drug suppliers, according to Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center\n\nReports from the national nonprofit, which provides information and analysis on death penalty issues, indicate at least 16 states have enacted secrecy statutes since 2011.\n\n\"Proponents of the death penalty, who want executions to be carried out, have been trying to do so secretly because it's become harder and harder for them to carry out the death penalty openly,\" Dunham said.\n\nThe law changes come at a time when public opinion on the death penalty is shifting.\n\nWhile polling by Gallup shows a majority of Americans still favor the death penalty for murder — the split was 56% to 42% in October — the level of support has dropped from 65% since Indiana's last execution in 2009. Meanwhile, opposition has risen from 31%.\n\nThat means public pressure — real or perceived — on drug providers is likely to continue and increase. And that puts states in a tough spot with a growing number of major pharmaceutical companies saying they don't want their medicines used in executions.\n\n\"The secrecy efforts are part of the effort to go underground to keep the public and the pharmaceutical companies from knowing what the states are trying to do,\" said Dunham.\n\nJust because no executions are currently scheduled in Indiana, he said the legal fight isn't moot. And a verdict for the state is no guarantee Indiana will be able to get the drugs it needs.\n\n\"A decision by the Supreme Court in favor of the state removes perhaps one road block toward resuming executions,\" said Fisher, the state's solicitor general.\n\n\"At that point we'd be able to, with more certainty and confidence, promise confidentiality to suppliers and manufacturers. Whether we'd be able to find people willing to supply the drugs in that circumstance would remain to be seen.\"\n\nContact Tim Evans at 317-444-6204 or tim.evans@indystar.com.

Brackeen, a series of consolidated cases that seek to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act. The law, enacted in 1978 to address the high numbers of Native children being separated from their families, gives tribal nations a say in child welfare cases involving children who are members of a federally recognized tribe or eligible for membership.\n\nIt also establishes placement preferences for when a Native child is up for adoption, giving priority first to the child’s extended family, then other members of the child’s tribe and then other Native families.\n\nAt the center of the case is a White couple from Texas who ran into obstacles while attempting to adopt a Navajo boy they were fostering. Litigation giant Gibson Dunn took on the case for free, and the couple was ultimately able to adopt the child over a Navajo family.\n\nBut the couple, who are plaintiffs in the case along with other White foster parents and the state of Texas, is now arguing that the Indian Child Welfare Act places them “last in line” to adopt more Native children. In other words, they argue, it discriminates on the basis of race.\n\nTribal leaders and experts in federal Indian law say that misunderstands both how the Indian Child Welfare Act and tribal nations function.\n\n“To say that this is all just about race or racism really undermines the separate sovereignty that these governments have and their separate identities as tribal nations,” says Elizabeth Reese, an assistant professor of law at Stanford University and a scholar of tribal and federal Indian law.\n\nThe case isn’t just about the welfare of Native children, Reese and others say. They view it as an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nThe law was a response to systemic harms\n\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted specifically to remedy federal policies that systematically separated Native children from their families and communities.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, tens of thousands of Native children were removed from their homes and forced to attend residential boarding schools in an attempt to assimilate them into White American society. They were forbidden from speaking their languages and stripped of their cultures, and an initial investigation found that the deaths of at least 500 American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children could be attributed to the boarding schools – a number that is thought to be an underestimate.\n\nAs the residential schools fell out of favor, another policy aimed at assimilating Native Americans emerged. From 1958 to 1967, the federal government partnered with the Child Welfare League of America on the Indian Adoption Project, which placed hundreds of Native children in the homes of White families. It was billed as a progressive contrast to adoption practices at the time, which emphasized “matching” so that the child and adoptive parents appeared biologically related.\n\nAs many as one-third of Native children were removed from their homes in those years and placed with non-Native families, and congressional hearings on the issue revealed that ignorance and bias from child welfare workers contributed to their disproportionate removal.\n\n“There was an erosion of language, culture, cohesion within the community, and an erosion of the civic life of tribal communities because we had federal and state-level policies that resulted in the dispossession of our children across Indian country,” Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN.\n\nCongress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978, determining that it was in the best interests of Native children to remain connected to their communities and that those children were key to the continued existence of tribes. In the decades since, the law has been heralded as the “gold standard” of child welfare policy.\n\nOpponents argue it hurts Native children\n\nOpponents of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which include Republican states and conservative organizations such as the Goldwater Institute, argue that the Indian Child Welfare Act goes against the best interests of Native children by imposing standards that make it harder for them to be adopted into stable, loving homes.\n\n“The best-interests-of-the-child standard is a holistic and individualized assessment that takes account of all of a child’s circumstances and needs and prioritizes their well-being,” Matthew McGill, a lawyer representing the non-Native adoptive families and a partner at Gibson Dunn, wrote in an email to CNN. “In the Supreme Court, the lawyer representing Indian tribes acknowledged that ICWA does not incorporate this familiar best-interests test.”\n\nNative children are overrepresented in the foster care system, and critics of the law have said that its preferences are problematic because there are more Native children in foster care than there are Native homes to place them in.\n\nBut Kate Fort, director of the Indian Law Clinic at Michigan State University, said that courts must consider the child’s best interests, which in this case happens to include a child’s connection to their tribe, culture and community.\n\nA group of non-Native foster parents, Republican states and conservative groups are seeking to overturn the Indian Child Welfare Act, enacted in 1978 to prevent the breakup of Native families. The US Supreme Court heard arguments in the case last week. Samuel Corum/Getty Images\n\n“ICWA doesn’t supplant or erase the best interest of the child. It supplements it,” she said.\n\nWhen a Native child is placed in foster care, the arrangement is generally considered temporary, Fort said. The ultimate goal is to reunify that child with their parent, or when that isn’t an option, to find the best adoptive home for them.\n\n“When we’re looking at a permanent placement, we’re in a different calculus for the best interest of the child than we are in a foster care placement,” Fort added. “We’re trying to find what is going to be good for this child when she’s seven, 16, 18 – when she ages out potentially of a stranger foster care home. Generally speaking for all kids, we know it’s with relatives and in their communities.”\n\nStill, there are exceptions to the preferences outlined in the Indian Child Welfare Act. As Rebecca Nagle noted in The Atlantic, non-Native foster parents were able to adopt Native children over a blood relative in two of the three underlying custody cases in Haaland v. Brackeen.\n\n“These preferences are just that – they’re preferences,” Reese said. “They still allow for the adoption of children by non-Indian families. The law itself is written to allow judges who are hearing cases involving the placement of Indian children to exercise their discretion about when it makes sense to depart from these placement preferences.”\n\nSome also say the law amounts to reverse racism\n\nOne of the plaintiffs’ core arguments is that the Indian Child Welfare Act is racist.\n\nIn giving preferences to a child’s relatives, members of their tribe and other Native families when placing a Native child for adoption, the law discriminates against non-Native adoptive parents, according to the plaintiffs.\n\nWhile Native Americans are often considered to be a racial group, tribes are political entities and citizenship in a tribe is a political status. The Indian Child Welfare Act doesn’t apply to any child with Native ancestry, but rather only to an “Indian child” – a legal definition that refers to a child who is a member of a tribe or a child whose parent is a tribal member and who is eligible for membership.\n\nOpponents of the Indian Child Welfare Act are arguing that the law discriminates on the basis of race. Tribal nations say that misunderstands their political status. Mariam Zuhaib/AP\n\nBecause of their unique political standing, tribes dispute the notion that the preferences outlined in the Indian Child Welfare Act amount to racial discrimination. The Supreme Court has agreed, holding in a 1974 case that such preferences weren’t discriminatory but rather “reasonably designed to further the cause of Indian self-government.”\n\nThe plaintiffs also assert that the law discriminates against Native children, stating in a court filing that it places them “in a disfavored position, depriving them of a placement decision based on their best interests, and instead requiring placements based on the child’s “biolog[y].”\n\n“In the United States, citizenship is based primarily on birth within the territory of the United States,” McGill, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, wrote in an email to CNN. “ICWA classifies children based on their ancestry, and children are powerless to change that.”\n\nBut tribal citizenship isn’t limited to ancestry, said Cherokee Nation Deputy Attorney General Chrissi Nimmo. Just as in the US, there are other ways of becoming a citizen beyond where a person is born. For example, the Cherokee Nation grants citizenship to the descendants of people once enslaved by the tribe, whether or not they have Cherokee ancestry.\n\n“There is some biological aspect to citizenship in that I’m a Cherokee citizen, and my children are eligible for citizenship,” Nimmo said. “But it’s the same biological aspect in born citizenship in the United States.”\n\nBut tribes see it as an attack on their sovereignty\n\nFor tribal nations, the Indian Child Welfare Act is about their future.\n\n“There’s nothing that is more central to core self-governance and sovereignty than having the next generation of citizens in your government,” Nimmo said.\n\nWith this legal case, that future hangs in the balance. If the Supreme Court were to rule that tribes are racial groups rather than political entities and that the law is therefore unconstitutional, much of the legal basis for tribal sovereignty would be at risk, Reese said.\n\n“If that is the case for the Indian Child Welfare Act, then there is little to say that that’s not the case for tons of other statutes across the federal code,” she said. “For example, [those codes] create health care for Indian persons under the Indian Health Service. Is that an impermissible racial discrimination? What about the holding of lands by the federal government in trust for specific Indian tribes?”\n\nAnother argument made by the plaintiffs – particularly that the Indian Child Welfare Act is an overreach of Congress’ powers regarding tribal affairs – could have similarly wide-ranging implications if the Court were to agree, she added. It could call into question virtually all of Title 25 of the US Code, a section of the law that pertains to Indians and tribes.\n\n“If that whole section is constitutionally suspect, that’s a huge problem for tribes,” she said.", "authors": ["Harmeet Kaur"], "publish_date": "2022/11/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/politics/gun-control-second-amendment-supreme-court-bruen-fallout/index.html", "title": "How the Supreme Court put gun control laws in jeopardy nationwide ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt did not take long for top gun rights activists to realize that the Second Amendment ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in June was going to transform the legal fight over access to firearms.\n\nDudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, said the realization started to come when he received a phone call from another executive at his organization minutes after the decision was released.\n\n“He had just scanned through it. He said, ‘You won’t believe what this decision says. it’s way better than what we ever hoped for,’” Brown told CNN. Brown was coincidentally at the time walking by the Supreme Court, trekking between Senate and House offices as part of a lobbying push against new gun legislation being considered in the wake a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n“Quickly, we knew this was something that was going to change the landscape,” Brown said.\n\nIn the three months since the 6-3 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, scores of new lawsuits have been filed against gun restrictions at the federal, state and local levels.\n\nThough the Supreme Court case concerned a type of gun permitting regime embraced by just a handful of states, the conservative majority used the Bruen decision to provide new instructions for how courts are to assess the constitutionality of gun laws nationwide.\n\nThe decision was the first major Supreme Court guns ruling in more than a decade, and it came after Justice Clarence Thomas – who authored the majority opinion – had previously complained that the high court had allowed the Second Amendment to be treated as a “a disfavored right.”\n\nSince the June ruling, federal judges in at least a half-dozen different cases have already cited the Bruen decision to rule against gun restrictions that have included local assault weapons bans, prohibitions on the manufacture of homemade firearms and bans on older teenagers publicly carrying handguns.\n\nSeveral other laws now face new legal challenges under the precedent, among them zoning restrictions barring shooting ranges, licensing and training laws and the federal ban on certain misdemeanor offenders from possessing firearms.\n\n“The much more consequential thing about Bruen is that the court actually went further and did a little bit more than it needed to do and articulated an entirely new framework for how Second Amendment challenges are decided,” said Andrew Willinger, the executive director of Duke Center for Firearms Law.\n\nWhat the Supreme Court told judges to do\n\nThe case the Supreme Court decided last term was a challenge to the New York state system of approving licenses for gun owners to publicly carry their weapons. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the rules – in which government officials had some discretion in deciding whether an applicant would be granted a license – violated the Second Amendment.\n\nBut what extended the reach of the ruling beyond the roughly half dozen states with similar licensing procedures was what Thomas said about how courts should decide whether gun limits comply with the Second Amendment.\n\nThomas said that the only regulations that can be deemed constitutional are ones don’t encroach on conduct plainly covered by the Second Amendment’s text and that are “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition” – meaning they have a parallel in the type of regulations in place at the time of the Constitution’s framing.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, writing for the three liberal dissenters, wrote that this approach was “deeply impractical” and that it imposed “a task on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish.”\n\nBefore the Supreme Court’s ruling, lower courts were coalescing around an approach that weighed the burden a restriction put on gun rights against the rationale the government had for implementing the law. The flurry of litigation spawned by the new precedent has begun to show how much the Bruen test will remake the legal playing field around firearms.\n\nA federal district judge cited the ruling last month when halting Delaware restrictions on possessing and manufacturing untraceable firearms, saying that the law’s defenders failed to provide persuasive evidence that similar restrictions existed in the historical record. The precedent was also referenced when local assault weapon bans in two Colorado jurisdictions were put on hold this summer; the judges in both cases were each appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Syracuse leaned on Bruen to pause several New York restrictions, including limits on carrying firearms to sensitive places like summer camps, domestic violence shelters and zoos.\n\nLaws that withstood legal challenge in the past are now in jeopardy.\n\nTexas’ public carry handgun ban for 18- to 20-year-olds – a ban that was upheld by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2012 – was struck down by a district court last month. US District Judge Mark Pittman wrote in the opinion that he had not been pointed to any Founding-era laws that were a “sufficient historical analog to support Texas’s statutory prohibition.”\n\nGun safety advocates say there are cases where the historical record will be on their side, and, at least in the early post-Bruen flurry of legal action, some laws have been successfully defended in court.\n\nA judge who declined to block a San Jose, California, law requiring liability insurance for gun owners said that the mandate had adequate parallels in 19th century surety laws, which required some individuals to post bond in order to carry weapons. A week after a federal judge in Texas ruled against a federal law banning those under felony indictment from buying, the same judge decided in favor of the prohibitions on convicted felons possessing firearms. US District Judge David Counts reasoned in the latter case that there was a historical tradition supporting the exclusion from the Second Amendment’s protections people who “squander their rights for crimes and violence.”\n\n“If the question is now whether there’s a tradition of regulating firearms in different respects, we think that the historical evidence is going to show the answer is yes,” said Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, which is the litigation arm of the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nChanging the work advocates must do to defend restrictions\n\nThe Bruen ruling, when laying out the historical prong of the test, said it was up to the government that was defending a gun law to prove the restriction had a parallel in the past.\n\nThis shift in burden has put gun rights groups at a greater advantage in court. It has also changed the type of work that government defenders – and the outside gun safety groups that often support them in litigation – must do to advocate for their laws.\n\n“Imagine if you are a district attorney, somewhere in some random state, you suddenly get a lawsuit brought on this, on some gun law you’ve got, and then you’ve got maybe 30 days to respond to the lawsuit. What are you going to do?” said Carlton Larson, a professor at UC-Davis School of Law who specializes in the historical basis of Second Amendment rights.\n\n“I am a legal historian by training,” Larson said. “I would find it very, very hard to turn around quickly on that and come up with something thoughtful.”\n\nBut gun rights advocates say this work of historical analysis is a better fit for courts than the means-ends balancing test that many lower courts were applying pre-Bruen. The old approach required courts to act like legislators, said Peter Patterson – a lawyer for the firm Cooper and Kirk, which has represented gun rights groups in high profile cases – while the historical analysis, he said, is “much more a judicial task.”\n\nThe Bruen decision has also put a greater focus on the first prong of the legal test – whether the conduct being burden is even covered by the Second Amendment in the first place – which was a question that was “underappreciated” in litigation over gun laws in the past, according to Tirschwell.\n\nUnanswered legal questions courts will hash out\n\nAs lower courts begin to apply the new precedent, questions left open by the Bruen ruling will be hashed out and debated.\n\nWhile finding laws in the historical record may be “clear cut,” according to David Kopel, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, “there’s still room for judicial discretion” in deciphering how closely a contemporary law must mimic its historical counterpart to be upheld.\n\n“Bruen says: You can have a modern gun law, that it doesn’t have to be a twin of some historic law. You can reason by analogy,” Kopel said.\n\nUS District Judge Glenn Suddaby, the judge who blocked parts of a New York gun law Thursday, said the historical parallels were strong enough for him to let stand the state’s ban on carrying firearms into schools.\n\n“However, the Court cannot find these historical statutes analogous to a prohibition on ‘summer camps,’” he wrote, so he was halting the ban on carrying firearms there.\n\nOne question legal experts will be watching is what Bruen means for the types of gun laws that the Supreme Court had previously identified as “presumptively lawful” in the landmark 2008 Heller case establishing that individuals have a right to bear arms. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the ruling was not meant to cast doubt on restrictions on carrying guns in sensitive places, possession bans for the mentally ill or felons, or other certain conditions imposed on the purchase of firearms.\n\n“It seems to be those that those Heller exceptions are up for grabs, potentially,” Larson said, referring to the name of the 2008 case.\n\nAnother question raised by the Bruen decision is what should be the historical touchpoint for assessing whether a restriction is constitutional: the 1791 enshrining of the Bill of Rights or the 1868 ratification of the 14th Amendment, under which the court has extended the protections against federal infringements on gun rights to state and local governments.\n\nGun advocates are staking out their arguments for seeing the earlier time period as the relevant one for whether a contemporary gun law has a historical analogue.\n\n“It’s really difficult for me to see guideposts in what the court said in Bruen,” Willinger said. “It really does leave quite a bit up to the judge in terms of determining what level of generality do I use to look at the history.”", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/04/supreme-court-opioid-oxycontin-purdue-pharma-sackler/71801451007/", "title": "Supreme Court split on whether the Sackler family can be sued over ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − The Supreme Court on Monday appeared divided over whether the Sackler family, which made its fortune selling a drug that fueled the nation's opioid epidemic, could be shielded from civil lawsuits by paying $6 billion to victims and drug treatment programs as part of a bankruptcy settlement with the company it once ran.\n\nThe high court is being asked to decide a question related to bankruptcy law, but just below the surface is a wrenching debate over how much to punish the Sacklers for their role in the crisis -- and whether blowing up the current settlement might jeopardize any payout for tens of thousands of victims and their families.\n\nThe vast majority of victims support the settlement with Purdue Pharma, the company that made OxyContin and marketed the drug as less addictive than other opioids. But the Justice Department stepped into the case to question whether courts can absolve the Sackler family from future lawsuits − a practice that has been used in major bankruptcies dealing with harms caused by asbestos and silicone breast implants.\n\nFamilies:These two moms lost sons to opioids. Now they’re on opposite sides at the Supreme Court.\n\n\"The opioids victims and their families overwhelmingly approve of this plan because they think it will ensure prompt payment,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nJustice Elena Kagan noted the \"huge, huge, huge majority of claimants who have decided that if this provision goes under, they're going to end up with nothing\" and questioned why the federal government's position would, hypothetically, allow \"one nutcase holdout\" to hold up a settlement agreed to most victims.\n\nBut Justice Neil Gorsuch leaned into an attorney for Purdue about the fact that the settlements foreclose victims' ability to bring future civil lawsuits against the Sacklers, such as for fraud, without their consent.\n\n\"We don't normally say that a non-consenting party can have its claim...eliminated in this fashion without consent\" or court review, Gorsuch said. \"This would defy what we do\" in other contexts, he said, and would \"raise serious due process concerns.\"\n\nAfter nearly two hours of arguments it was not clear which way the justices were leaning.\n\nSupporters say it's uncertain whether a better deal could ever be reached with Purdue. The bankruptcy fight has already dragged on for years, allowing the Sacklers to hold on to the billions they have promised – money governments will use to pay for addiction treatment programs. Pratik Shah, a lawyer for some of those victims, warned that they may not receive any money if the Supreme Court sinks the agreement.\n\nBut opponents have questioned the true scope of support for the settlement, noting it's impossible to count future victims, for instance. A 13-year-old who lost her parents to opioids, for example, might not be able to bring a claim against the Sacklers today. Under the agreement, she would be barred from doing so forever. They also note that the Sacklers put a \"final offer\" on the table once before and then wound up agreeing to a higher payout later.\n\nThe case is Harrington v. Purdue Pharma.

Milanovich\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nMost of us, at some point, struggle to fit into our own skin. We work (sometimes fight) to understand, improve and accept who we are. And for many American youth, high school athletics serve as an early way to strengthen identity — to discern and develop the skills and abilities that grow us into adults.\n\nSince the advent of Title IX in 1972 — a federal law that expanded athletic and educational opportunities for women — millions of girls and women have benefited from their own teams and chances for growth. But these opportunities risk being redefined and obliterated, because of a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe case, R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, will be argued this October. The case centers on the question of whether the meaning of the word \"sex\" in employment law (Title VII) also covers gender identity. While its outcome obviously matters for the people immediately involved, the Supreme Court’s ruling on the meaning of the word “sex” has direct and profound implications for other parts of federal law. It matters for the millions of girls and women affected by analogous laws such as those that ensure equal opportunities for education and athletic opportunities “on the basis of sex.”\n\nDon't reinvent the meaning of 'sex'\n\nThat’s why I’ve partnered with the Independent Women’s Forum and 1,013 individual athletes and parents from around the country to submit a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Harris Funeral Homes. Not only should business owners be able to rely on the plain meaning of the law, courts shouldn’t take on Congress’ job and reinvent the meaning of “sex.” Doing so would fundamentally redefine what it means to be a “girl” or a “woman” by judicial fiat and inject confusion, if not chaos, onto the track and the field, into the pool and the locker room.\n\nOur kids are crying for help:High school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.\n\nThat’s not hyperbole. The challenges — intended or not — are already emerging. For example, the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has a policy that allows high school students born male to compete in women’s athletic competitions if they identify as female, regardless of whether they have taken steps to alter their physiology.\n\nAs a result, since 2017, two biological males have collectively won 15 women’s track championship titles — previously held by 10 Connecticut females — against biologically female track athletes.\n\nAnd track isn’t the only impacted sport. A biological male competing as a female powerlifter after undergoing 11 months of hormone replacement therapy set multiple world records in the women's category at a 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation competition in April. Just one month longer, and the athlete's hormone therapy regimen would have been considered complete.\n\nIn 2014, a transgender athlete who was born male and underwent sex reassignment surgery competed in a female mixed martial arts competition. Not only was opponent Tamikka Brents tko'd (a technical knockout), she was left with a concussion and a broken skull. Biological males are even beating out biological females for qualification to compete in female-only Olympic competitions.\n\nMales and females are different\n\nThis shouldn’t surprise us. On average, men have 36% more skeletal muscle mass, according to one study. In general, males are taller, have thicker bones and have greater lung capacity than their female counterparts. Cross-hormone treatment (with all the risks and side effects such treatments entail) cannot fully suppress all these biological competitive advantages. Indeed, the entire premise behind sex-specific competition in sports is the simple scientific reality that, in general, males are stronger, faster and more physically powerful than females. As a result, if males and females are required to compete together, women will almost always lose.\n\nAt first, it was a dream come true:I was a transgender woman for eight years — time I can't get back\n\nAs Beth Stelzer, a biologically female amateur powerlifter and founder of Save Women’s Sports, observes, “If biological men are allowed to compete in women’s sports, there will be men’s sports, there will be co-ed sports, but there will no longer be women’s sports.”\n\nMy heart aches seeing the struggles of males who believe they are females. Anyone struggling with his or her identity in this way needs love, support, compassion and friendship — and absolutely deserves protection from bullying and violence.\n\nEven so, a just, equitable and compassionate solution simply cannot require the redefinition of what it means to be a girl or a woman. Loving each other does not necessitate a spot on the women’s team, or a woman’s trophy.\n\nAnita Y. Milanovich, attorney at Milanovich Law, has litigated constitutional issues for nearly 15 years.

A February study from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, found that an estimated 54% of US abortions used this method in 2020.\n\nFor the study, researchers from Bryn Mawr and University of California, San Diego studied Google search trends, including the words “abortion pill” and the names of the actual abortion medications – mifepristone/mifeprex, misoprostol/Cytotec. They looked at data from January 1, 2004, when Google started collecting the information, through May 8, 2022.\n\nThe period following the leak “corresponded with the greatest number of Google searches for abortion medication in the US,” with about 350,000 internet searches for the week of May 1 to May 8.\n\nStates with highly restrictive abortion laws saw a bigger spike in searches.

What to know about the Festival of Colors", "text": "Dubbed the Festival of Colors, the Hindu holiday of Holi is widely celebrated as a day of unity around India and the world. On the Indian national holiday, families celebrate by taking to the streets and dousing strangers and loved ones with colorful bursts of powder and splashes of water.\n\nFor a day, the Hindu caste rules are loosened, with children, men, women and elders alike joining in on the multicolored festivities. Once an ancient holiday, Holi is now celebrated worldwide with bonfires, feasts, singing and dancing. Here’s how you can join in on the colorful fun here in Arizona.\n\nWhen is Holi?\n\nHoli is celebrated annually to mark the end of winter and the beginning of the bountiful spring season, but the exact date it falls on fluctuates every year. This is because Holi is always held on the full-moon day of the Hindu month Phalguna, meaning that it typically falls around the end of February or the beginning of March.\n\nThis year, Holi will be observed on Monday, March 25. While the most anticipated festivities are typically held on the day of Holi, the celebrations aren’t always relegated to one day only. Typically, the traditions begin on the eve of Holi, called Holika Dahan, and they continue into the next day. However, different regions of India and the world may commemorate the holiday for even longer — from days to weeks.\n\nWhat is Holi?\n\nNow celebrated by millions around the world, Holi dates back centuries. The first documentation of the holiday can be traced back to a poem from the fourth century. Then, as now, Holi was celebrated not only to mark the beginning of the spring harvest but also to symbolize the triumph of good over evil.\n\nWhile the famous Holi festivity of throwing colored powder is perhaps the holiday’s most well-known tradition, families also celebrate by lighting large bonfires on Holika Dahan to represent the burning of evil spirits. Once the fires are ignited, celebrators will sing and dance around them or throw items like wood, dry leaves, coconut and chickpeas into the flames. As an act of purification, some may even gather the ash left by the fire and cover their bodies with it.\n\nThe colorful holiday is also known for its feasts of traditional foods, like the deep-fried dessert gujiya and the savory yogurt dish dahi bhalla. Some even toast Holi with bhang, a milky drink mixed with cannabis leaves grown in the Himalayas.\n\nWhy is Holi celebrated with colors?\n\nAfter the fiery celebrations that take place on Holika Dahan, celebrators flood the streets on the actual day of Holi, called Rangwali Holi, to shower each other in gulal, or vividly dyed powders. This colorful tradition is perhaps Holi’s most famous, and it originates from an ancient Hindu myth involving two divine lovers: Krishna and Radha.\n\nAfter a demon cursed the god Krishna with blue skin, he confessed to his mother, Yashoda, that he was worried the fair-skinned Radha would no longer love him. Yashoda joked that he should cover Radha in colored powder to make her resemble him. Krishna took the joke literally, and today, the tradition of throwing colored powders on Holi serves as a tribute to this myth.\n\nEach color of the dyes thrown on Holi has a specific meaning. While blue honors Krishna, red represents love and fertility, yellow signifies turmeric, and green symbolizes nature and new beginnings.\n\nWhat is the story behind Holi?\n\nEven though the roots of Holi are undoubtedly mythological, many different origin stories have been told over the centuries. One of the most popular Hindu legends involves the mythological king Hiranyakashyap, an evil ruler who believed he was better than all the gods. Despite his efforts to keep his son Prahlad from worshiping Vishnu, the Hindu protector of the universe, Prahlad persisted.\n\nTo punish his son, the king enlisted the help of his demon sister, Holika, from whom the names “Holika Dahan” and “Holi” derive. They conspired to kill Prahlad by having Hiranyakashyap order his sister and son to sit on a pyre. When the pyre was lit, they expected that Holika, who was immune to fire, would remain untouched while Prahlad would burn to ashes.\n\nOnce the flames were lit, however, Prahlad called upon Vishnu, who saved him, while Holika burnt to death despite her powers. Thus, Holi pays tribute to the moral of the myth: Good will always triumph over evil.\n\nHoli celebrations in Arizona\n\nFrom more traditional, spiritual celebrations to DJ dance parties, there is no shortage of Holi festivities across Arizona.

Independent-Mail\n\nEaster falls on April Fools' Day this year, the first time since 1956, and the joke writes itself.\n\nThere's a million ways to tell the wisecrack — considered by some historians to be the greatest prank in history — but the root of it goes like this: Jesus died and was resurrected three days later, the ultimate prank on the devil, said Cal Samra, editor and publisher of The Joyful Noiseletter, a magazine devoted to religious jokes and joys.\n\n\"You talk about a major miracle? This is it,\" he said. \"Early Christianity had a tremendous amount of joy, humor.\"\n\nMore:Be careful before biting into Easter eggs Sunday! It's also April Fools' Day\n\nMore:Chocolate Whopper? Burger King and others unleash fake news for April Fools' Day\n\nFrom April feasts to April fools\n\nThe origins of April Fools' Day are murky at best.\n\nLong before the advent of April Fools' Day, there were religious and agricultural celebrations in spring. Today the spring comes after people have been cooped up, but back then it was more about surviving winter, said Max Harris, author of Sacred Folly: A New History of the Feast of Fools.\n\nOne idea is that clowning around in the spring is an age-old tradition that's universal after hard winters, he said. The joyous religious celebrations around spring include the Hindu festival of colors, also known as Holi, and the Jewish holiday of Purim.\n\nThe oft-cited Feast of Fools in the Middle Ages, long thought to be an ancestor of April Fools', has no direct connection aside from the word \"fool\" and was a New Year's Day celebration, said Harris, whose work challenged the assumed connections.\n\nDuring the Feast of Fools, lower-ranking priests would be allowed to lead services in place of higher-ranking priests or bishops but there was no tomfoolery or funny hats, Harris said.\n\nOne of the religious precursors to April Fools' Day was risus paschalis, or Easter Laughter, a ritual in southern Germany in the 15th through 17th centuries, said Bernard Schweizer, a Long Island University professor who has studied and written about religion and humor.\n\nMore:Why egg hunts, bunnies and Peeps? Easter traditions explained\n\nPriests would urge their congregations to laugh out loud on Easter, telling jokes inside the church, said Schweizer, who communicated through email while in China.\n\n\"Easter was an occasion for joy, and collective laughter was seen as the strongest, most direct expression of joy,\" Schweizer said.\n\nThe Easter Laughter was prohibited by a papal order in the 1600s because of a pope's concern about mocking Christianity, he said.\n\nIt was one of a series of ups and downs for Christian humor, said Samra, of The Joyful Noiseletter. When Christianity becomes too serious, a new generation always brings back the joy and laughs.\n\n\"The Apostle Paul said we ought to be fools for Christ's sake,\" he said.\n\nThere's a lot of good when Christians laugh and enjoy life, said Father Dwight Longenecker, of Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church in Greenville.\n\nHe said the root word of humor is the same as humanity. Joy, laughter and fun are all parts of being good Christians, he said.\n\nExplaining the joke\n\nThe theology behind \"Jesus pranked the devil\" is a bit more complicated than it appears, said Schweizer.\n\nHe said the so-called prank was given heft by religious scholars, including Irenaeus, who was a second century Greek cleric, and St. Augustine of Hippo, some 200 years later.\n\nIt's known as the ransom theory of atonement and essentially says God tricked the devil by offering the sinless Jesus as a sacrificial ransom to release humanity from the devil's bondage, Schweizer said. The devil got more than he could expect and accepted Jesus' death as a sort of payment, he said.\n\n\"But in the resurrection, it became apparent that the devil had been tricked since Christ could not lastingly die. Satan lost his payout,\" Schweizer said.\n\nThis theory, however, raises problems for today's theologians, \"To think that God would be negotiating with the equivalent of a 'terrorist' and using Christ's life as a decoy,\" Schweizer said.\n\nA passage in the Bible: \"(T)he man Christ Jesus; who gave himself a ransom for all,\" is used to bolster the ransom theory.\n\nBut Walter Johnson, a Christian studies professor at Northern Greenville University, said the word ransom in the passage isn't taken literally by most religious scholars today.\n\nThe ransom theory also means the devil wouldn't have known Jesus was God's son or would not have understood Jesus could not be killed, Johnson said. For those and other reasons, most religious scholars today don't buy into an explicit ransom theory, Johnson said.\n\nEarly theologians, including Gregory of Nyssa, would revel in the idea of the resurrection as a practical joke on the devil, Johnson said.\n\nSaying Jesus or God played a joke, or deceived or bested the devil, is great material for sermons. It's an effective parable and it's fun to say, but it doesn't hold up to most scholars today, Johnson said.\n\nHe said theologians go with many other theories of atonement or resurrection, including the satisfaction or restitution theory, which holds that Jesus' great sacrifice satisfied God as no human restitution could have done.\n\nBut there's a beauty in the resurrection and its twist ending, said Father Longenecker.\n\n\"Jesus' resurrection is the biggest surprise that ever happened,\" he said. \"It's the divine joke that saves us.\"\n\nFollow Mike Ellis on Twitter @MikeEllis_AIM", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/01"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/961909/ten-things-you-need-to-know-today-5-august-2023", "title": "Ten Things You Need to Know Today: 5 August 2023 | The Week", "text": "1. UK storm a ‘risk to life’\n\nStorm Antoni is to bring “unseasonably strong” winds and heavy rain to the UK on Saturday. Rain and wind warnings have been issued for Northern Ireland and parts of south-west Britain as the first storm to be named by the Met Office this season arrives. Extreme conditions today may disrupt air, rail, road and ferry travel, with the potential to put lives at risk, as the low-pressure weather system moves in from the Atlantic, said meteorologists.\n\n2. Bank chief rates admission\n\nThe Bank of England is in danger of raising interest rates too far in its attempt to get inflation back under control, admitted its chief economist. As analysts warned that over-tightening would push the country into an “unnecessary recession”, Huw Pill conceded that “it is possible that we do too much” to rein in price rises. Earlier this year, Pill said faced widespread criticism for saying people need to accept being poorer.\n\n3. Cinemas blamed for Covid spike\n\nThe rise in Covid cases may be down to a “perfect storm” of wet weather and the Barbie and Oppenheimer film releases, said The Telegraph. Covid-19 cases increased by 45% in a week, accounting for around one in 20 respiratory infections. The rise came after millions of people “flocked to the cinema” after Barbie and Oppenheimer were released. The UK is nearly “flying blind” when it comes to Covid this autumn, experts have told The Guardian.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Ministers shut out Greenpeace\n\nGreenpeace is “locked in a war of words” with the government over their protest at Rishi Sunak’s constituency home, said the i paper. Ministers have broken off all engagement with the climate charity, and Thérèse Coffey, the Environment Secretary, has told officials in her department to cancel any planned and future meetings with the group after five activists climbed onto the roof of the PM’s house in North Yorkshire on Thursday. The charity accused ministers of failing to “engage with the world around them”.\n\n5. Lineker got M&S ovation\n\nGary Lineker said he received a “standing ovation” in M&S days after his controversial tweet that saw him compare language used by the government in their anti-migrant rhetoric to that used in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. “I recall walking to M&S two or three days in, and I got a standing ovation,” he told The Telegraph. “Well, I suppose everybody’s standing in M&S, but even so.” He also told the paper that he regards being called “woke” as a compliment.\n\n6. Private equity dominating childcare\n\nThe childcare sector risks becoming a “playground for private equity”, experts have said. According to analysis in The Guardian, investment funds have more than doubled their stake in the sector in just four years, prompting concern that the increasing involvement of private equity could leave providers more vulnerable to closure. The TUC said the sector needed sustainable and long-term investment, rather than “fly-by-night merchants looking to make a quick buck”.\n\n7. Navalny decries ‘Stalinist’ sentence\n\nAlexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, has been sentenced to a further 19 years in prison under “brutal conditions”, including a ban on talking to cellmates and “constant exposure to light”, said The Telegraph. The 47-year-old, who is Vladimir Putin’s fiercest domestic critic, is already serving more than 11 years in prison for fraud. His supporters insist the charges are trumped up. Navalny described the latest sentence as “Stalinist”.\n\n8. Streamer sparks NY disorder\n\nA social media influencer has been charged with inciting a riot and unlawful assembly after thousands-strong crowds gathered in Union Square in New York City for a giveaway. Dozens were arrested and several police officers injured as Kai Cenat, who has millions of followers on social media, said he would giveaway Playstation 5s. Police officers fought “pitch battles” with a “mob” of several thousand young rioters, said The Independent. “This is the power of social media,” said NYPD chief of department Jeffrey Maddrey. “We can’t allow this to happen again.”\n\n9. Izzard plans Brighton bid\n\nEddie Izzard has launched another attempt to become a Labour MP by running for Brighton Pavilion. The 61-year-old comedian is seeking selection as the candidate for seat, which has been held since 2010 by the Green Party’s Caroline Lucas, who will step down as an MP at the next election. Izzard, who failed in an attempt to be chosen as the Labour candidate for Sheffield Central last year, said that he was “just the latest in over 200 years of Izzards in East Sussex”.\n\n10. Boris may build ‘newt motels’\n\nBoris Johnson promised to do “whatever it takes” to protect newts in his garden after he was told they could stop him from building a swimming pool at his country manor. After Johnson sought permission in June for the new pool at his Oxfordshire residence, an ecologist advised planners to reject the proposal because it could threaten local populations of great crested newts.

Olsen\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark − Denmark’s prime minister proclaimed Frederik X as king on Sunday after his mother Queen Margrethe II formally signed her abdication as massive crowds turned out to rejoice in the throne passing from a beloved monarch to her popular son.\n\nMargrethe, 83, is the first Danish monarch to voluntarily relinquish the throne in nearly 900 years. Many thousands of people gathered outside the palace where the royal succession was taking place, the mood jubilant as the Nordic nation experienced in first royal succession in more than a half-century, and one not caused by the death of a monarch.\n\nWearing a magenta outfit, Margrethe signed her abdication during a meeting with the Danish Cabinet at the Christiansborg Palace, a vast complex in Copenhagen that houses the Royal Reception Rooms and Royal Stables as well as the Danish Parliament, the prime minister’s office and the Supreme Court.\n\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen next proclaimed Frederik king from the balcony of the palace before thousands of people.\n\nAbdication leaves Denmark with two queens\n\nThe abdication document was presented to Margrethe as she sat at a massive table covered in red cloth around which royals and members of the Danish government were seated. Frederik, who was in a ceremonial military uniform adorned with medals, sat beside her.\n\nAfter signing the document, Margrethe rose and gestured to Frederik to take her place. “God save the king,” she said as she left the room.\n\nThe abdication leaves Denmark with two queens: Margrethe keeps her title while Frederik’s Australian-born wife becomes Queen Mary. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son Christian, 18, has become crown prince and heir to the throne.\n\nChristian handed Margrethe her walking stick as she departed her abdication ceremony.\n\nCiting health issues, Margrethe announced on New Year’s Eve that she would step down, stunning a nation that had expected her to live out her days on the throne, as is tradition in the Danish monarchy. Margrethe underwent major back surgery last February and didn’t return to work until April.\n\nMargrethe's abdication came as a surprise\n\nEven the prime minister was unaware of the queen’s intentions until right before the announcement. Margrethe had informed Frederik and his younger brother Joachim just three days earlier, the Berlingske newspaper wrote, citing the royal palace.\n\nPeople from across Denmark gathered outside parliament. Many swarmed streets decorated with red and white Danish flags. Several shops hung photos of the queen and king-to-be, while city buses were adorned with smaller Danish flags as is customary during royal events. Many others across the kingdom of nearly 6 million people followed a live television broadcast of the historic event.\n\nThe royal guards’ music band made their daily parade through downtown Copenhagen but wore red jackets, instead of their usual black, to mark major events.\n\nCopenhagen resident Rene Jensen, wearing a replica of a royal robe and a bejeweled purple crown on his head, said that he expected Frederik to be “a king for the nation, representing us everywhere.”\n\nThe last time a Danish monarch voluntarily resigned was in 1146 when King Erik III Lam stepped down to enter a monastery. Margrethe abdicated on the same day she ascended the throne following the death of her father, King Frederik IX.\n\nDenmark’s monarchy traces its origins to 10th-century Viking king Gorm the Old, making it the oldest in Europe and one of the oldest in the world. Today the royal family’s duties are largely ceremonial.\n\nAustralians also turned out on the streets of Copenhagen to celebrate one of their own becoming queen.\n\n“I think it’s good that she’s not from royalty and has a normal Australian background. We can relate more to that, because she’s from a middle-class background, and we are, too,” said Judy Langtree, who made the long journey from Brisbane with her daughter to witness the royal event.\n\nA survey − commissioned by Denmark’s public broadcaster DR −published Friday showed that 79% of the 1,037 people polled by the Epinion polling institute said that they believed Frederik was prepared to take the reigns and 83% said they thought his wife Mary was ready to become queen.

Plus how a PAC scheme is helping pay his legal fees and what pawn shops can tell us about the state of the economy. Former President Donald Trump's bond in his New York civil fraud case is due today and he so far hasn't been able to make it. I caught up with USA today, Justice Department Correspondent Aysha Bagchi for more on what might happen to his assets and a look ahead to another one of his legal issues. Aysha, thanks for making the time today.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nHi, Taylor. It's good to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Aysha, what have we been hearing in the buildup to this bond deadline?\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nIt's been unclear. Trump's lawyers told a New York Appeals court that they have gone to 30 bonding companies and not one of them was willing to provide this entire bond based on the terms Trump's team was willing or able to offer. They said that they wanted a bond where they would put up a mixture of assets including some real estate, and no bonding company was willing to take that as collateral to put up a bond of $464 million. So they have been struggling for a while. We have seen this. That doesn't mean that he couldn't have come up with something somehow at the last minute, but that hasn't happened yet.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Aysha, what does this functionally mean for Trump and his assets going forward? I know you and I have talked about which of his assets might be seized.\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nYes, so this means sometime this week the New York Attorney General could start going after Trump's assets. How that looks in practice kind of depends on the asset you're talking about and where the asset is. But the fastest thing that she could go after is a bank account and cash in a bank account. If she knows where his bank accounts are already, she could send a subpoena there or she could send an official document, it's called a writ of execution, to a marshal in New York with a request for an immediate levy on the bank. And then his assets in a bank account could be frozen pretty much immediately. And the turnaround time for actually seizing those funds would be measured in days or weeks I've been told. So very fast. Then when you're talking about other types of property, real estate would take the longest, especially if you're talking about real estate that is in Donald Trump's name alone.\n\nThere are some protections, particularly in New York when it comes to residences. So that would probably involve a kind of court process. If it's real estate that's in a corporation's name that's subject to this judgment, then things could happen faster. And personal property is somewhere in between in terms of the speed with which Letitia James could take these assets, but she can get the ball rolling. And actually even before this deadline, we saw that she was rolling the ball. She had already extended the lien, which is in New York County and Manhattan where the judgment was to another in New York State, which is a preliminary thing she would need to do to go after his real estate there. So things could start to unfold very quickly, especially when it comes to cash.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump legal news just never stops. There's a big court hearing today in Trump's separate criminal hush money case. Aysha, refresh us on what's at stake in this case and what we can expect later today.\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nRight. So this was the one Trump criminal case that had a firm date that seemed to be sticking of March 25th to start. And then suddenly this month that date was wiped from the books. There were federal prosecutors who sent over 100,000 pages of new documents to Donald Trump, or at least some of them are new. And that document dump caused this delay. And basically the hearing today is over a couple of things. Trump has said that state prosecutors who are bringing the case should have gotten these documents and turned them over themselves. And so Trump thinks the entire case should be dismissed because he didn't get these documents sooner. But the judge has said he's going to have a hearing to review that, but also to review setting a new trial date. The judge only created a delay through mid-April, so it's still very possible that we could get a new trial date where this trial gets underway pretty soon.\n\nBut the case is about 34 felony counts that Donald Trump is facing for falsifying business records. So it's a kind of technical case about New York law around business records, but it really comes down to thinking about what was happening in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. At that time, Donald Trump's lawyer at the time, Michael Cohen, made a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels, an adult film actor, allegedly in order to cover up a story that Stormy Daniels had about having had an affair with Donald Trump in the past. And this was at a time when the Access Hollywood tape had come out. Donald Trump's campaign was really worried about how voters, especially women, would view him as a candidate. And this payment was made. And then according to prosecutors, Donald Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen later and falsified records having to do with what that reimbursement was for in order allegedly to cover up a hush money payment.\n\nSo that's what the case is about. Each of the counts carries a maximum penalty of four years. So technically you could be theoretically talking about over 100 years in prison if each count he was found guilty and they were all run consecutively. But that is extremely unlikely. I've talked to people who have estimated that even if Trump were found guilty on every count, we're talking about a range of maybe no prison time at all to four years in prison. Nothing's so extreme, but it is a criminal case that he's facing. And if he were found guilty, he could be a convicted felon before election day this year.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Aysha Bagchi covers the Justice Department for USA today. Thank you, Aysha.\n\nAysha Bagchi:\n\nThanks, Taylor.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, an elaborate PAC scheme is helping pay Donald Trump's legal fees. A pro-Trump super PAC has been millions of dollars every month to the former President's Fund for paying his ballooning legal bills. The transfers have kept the fund Save America afloat, as it bled tens of millions of dollars on legal bills in the year since a New York grand jury indicted Trump the first in a wave of criminal indictments and civil judgments against him. In the past, Save America's highest spending involved audiovisual expenses for Trump's public appearances, and donations to other groups, including a super PAC started in 2022 called Make America Great Again Incorporated.\n\nBut the money Save America has spent on legal bills, including the firms that represent Trump in both civil and criminal cases, has skyrocketed in the past two years. So MAGA Inc. has stepped in to bail out Save America by paying it back. It sent five million dollars at the beginning of every month from last July through February to save America, totaling 40 million in addition to 12.3 million that MAGA Inc transferred in May and June. That's according to records from the Federal Election Commission. You can read more with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nPresident Joe Biden says the economy is on the upswing. And while that's true for some, pawn shops are telling a different story. I spoke with USA Today National Reporter, Lauren Villagran to learn more. Lauren, thanks for dropping on.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nHey Taylor. Thank you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Lauren, let's just start with this, President Joe Biden has been touting the economy's success. What indicators does he point to?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nSo there are a lot of things that are going really well for the economy. There are nine million job openings. The unemployment is at record lows. Americans have been dealing with really severe inflation over the past couple of years, but it's slowed considerably despite picking up a little bit in January and February. The Federal Reserve Bank has said that they may start to cut interest rates this year, so that would help with access to credit in the country. But that economic picture is not as rosy for everyone.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So you wrote about pawn shops. I'm curious, Lauren, how do pawn shops act as a kind of rainy day fund for many Americans?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nWell, incredibly Taylor, there are many Americans who don't have enough money to open a bank account. They live in a cash economy and don't have access to things like credit cards. So the pawn shop can act as a sort of rainy day fund as you said, between paychecks, for example. I met a man in El Paso who is sort of a frequent flyer, he brings in things that he has of value to get short-term loans which is what pawn shops offer.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPawn shops are currently accumulating inventory as you write in the piece, Lauren, what can this tell us about the economy as a whole right now?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nWell, we know that the economic recovery after COVID-19 has been uneven. And I got to thinking, what does a pawn shop owner know that maybe many Americans or even the Biden administration doesn't? And I had the opportunity to talk to a fourth generation pawn shop owner in El Paso, Texas, Clay Barron. He runs a really famous shop in downtown El Paso called Dave's. There's an Elvis statue outside, and the King's hits are always playing into the street. And he shared some information that I thought was really interesting. He said, \"It seemed like a lot of Americans are a bit dry now. Folks are coming in looking for short-term cash loans.\" And of course there's also the price of gold.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So what are we seeing with the price of gold and what else are we seeing nationally on this conversation, Lauren?\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nFolks start to dig up their grandma's gold rings when the price of gold goes a bit crazy, which is where it's at now. The price of gold has been hitting new records starting in December, and even just as recently as this week, gold hit $2,200 a Troy ounce, which was a historic peak. Gold, Taylor, is a traditional hedge against inflation. People often flock to gold when they feel like their dollars aren't going to be worth as much. But you see the pattern that Clay Barron has seen in his shop repeated across the country. Two major corporate owners of pawn shops in the US also are reporting higher inventory. So what does that mean? It means that folks are coming in, they're pawning an item for a short-term loan and they're not coming back to pay that loan or to pick up the item. And so pawn shops put those items up for sale. And again, both Barron's shop, which is just chock-full of inventory like rings and watches and belt buckles and stereo equipment, pawn shops across the country are seeing something similar.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Lauren Villagran is a national reporter with USA Today. Thank you, Lauren.\n\nLauren Villagran:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDozens of people are suing saying that Ozempic and other weight loss and diabetes drugs cause harmful side effects. Patients are suing Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, the two companies that make drugs within this class of medication saying they suffer distressing digestive symptoms like gallbladder removal or gastroparesis after taking the drug. Millions of Americans have flocked to this class of drugs which are prescribed for diabetes and weight loss, and have become a blockbuster category of medications for drug companies. The suits accused the companies of to notify patients about the side effects of their popular diabetes or weight loss drugs. Those drugs include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus and Eli Lilly's Trulicity and Mounjaro. Novo Nordisk faces the most suits, and representatives of the company said in a statement that the cases are without merit.\n\n♦\n\nAnd today is the celebration of Holi, the Hindu festival of colors.

But, after the passenger was seated, a United flight attendant is said to have insisted that the pet carrier -- and dog -- must be stowed in an overhead bin instead of underneath the flier's seat, as is standard practice.\n\nKokito, the dog, was found dead from suffocation after the flight from Houston arrived to Newark.\n\nThe Rebledo family that owned the dog had been considering a lawsuit against the carrier, multiple media outlets reported earlier this month.\n\nNow, according to the TMZ report, the family has reached a settlement with United, although terms were not revealed.\n\n\"We are deeply sorry for this tragic accident and have worked with the Robledo family to reach a resolution,\" United spokesman Charles Hobart said to USA TODAY when asked if United could confirm TMZ's report.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS: The fleet and hubs of United Airlines (story continues below)\n\nUnited had already publicly apologized for the incident, which also prompted it to suspend and ultimately revamp its policy on the types of animals eligible to fly in its cargo hold. Some breeds were banned outright.\n\n\"In March, we began a comprehensive review of our transportation of animals,\" Hobart said. \"We also recently announced our collaboration with American Humane to make significant improvements in our program and adhere to the best practices of animal comfort, well-being and travel on behalf of our customers and their pets.\"\n\nHowever, the change to the cargo-hold policy would not have applied to Kokito, who had been flying with its owners in the cabin.\n\nThe incident was the latest in a string of high-profile episodes that have challenged United’s public relations team during the past year. The April 2017 passenger-dragging incident with Dr. David Dao was perhaps the highest profile, but -- among others -- there have also been multiple mishaps with pets and an employee lottery plan that fell flat when it was introduced as a replacement for worker bonuses.\n\nNow, United has a new public relations chief to help it navigate – or, hopefully, avoid – such public relations crises.\n\nThe Chicago-based carrier has tapped former White House press secretary Josh Earnest for the company’s top communications role.\n\nWith the title of “senior vice president and chief communications officer,” Earnest took the reigns at United this week.\n\nEarnest is probably best known to most Americans for his eight-year stint at the White House, where he served first as deputy press secretary and later as the White House Press Secretary under President Barack Obama.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/daniel-finney/2016/05/25/making-weight-year-2-daniel-finney/84895382/", "title": "Making Weight: Embrace exercise zeal", "text": "Daniel P. Finney, dafinney@dmreg.com\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 16, 2016\n\nEmbracing the zeal\n\nA friend made an offhanded joke about CrossFit members being a cult while we were hanging out a while back.\n\nI know he doesn’t read my paragraphs, so I decided to let him talk.\n\nHe complained about the fact that CrossFit athletes tend to talk about their accomplishments a lot and seem boastful about their fitness.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFinally, I told my friend that I went to CrossFit Merle Hay. The workouts have helped me lose more than 120 pounds, get stronger, more flexible and more mobile than I have been in years.\n\nMy friend shrugged and said I didn’t seem like a narcissist. I let the conversation thread die out.\n\nIt strikes me as ironic to be judged harshly for both being morbidly obese and for trying to fight it at a gym.\n\nI should say this for the record: I don’t endorse CrossFit. This is the gym and workout plan I chose, mostly because of my close friendship with CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho.\n\nI generally support any course of action that involves eating less and moving more, especially in a society as sedentary as ours, whether it be long walks or a regimented program of diet and exercise.\n\nCrossFit seems to have some kind of reputation as a place where people get hurt. I don’t understand this, in part because I went to CrossFit while I was hurting.\n\nMy knees hurt so bad it was hard to step off curbs or get in and out of cars. I could easily hurt my back carrying in groceries or getting out of bed.\n\nAt CrossFit, I’ve only gotten stronger, faster and leaner.\n\nAm I a picture of fitness? Absolutely not.\n\nThe things I see the elite athletes do at CrossFit boggle my mind. The feats seem truly superhuman.\n\nBut we all had different goals. My goal is losing weight and having the physical strength and endurance to live my life without limitations as long as possible.\n\nIt’s true that CrossFit athletes do talk about their activities. I spent a good five minutes talking to Nate about my technique on the rowing machine in a recent session.\n\nNate encouraged me to lean back farther, pull harder with my arms to get the most out of my strong legs. The first workout I tried his tips in resulted in much higher rotations per minute during my rows.\n\nA year ago, I never thought I would ever have a conversation with anyone about technique on a rowing machine.\n\nThat CrossFit athletes talk about what they do isn’t so unusual. How many times have you been stuck next to someone who is very into gardening, shopping of fantasy football?\n\nI don’t write these paragraphs to pick on my friend. He’s as good and loyal a man as I know.\n\nWhat I am emphasizing, however, is that we could all do a better job of being more tolerant of different ideas and different ways.\n\nThe truth is, I probably held much the same view of CrossFit as my buddy before I started it. I thought of CrossFit athletes as zealots.\n\nBut if this zealously is helping improve and extend my life. Count me all the way in.\n\nWEDNESDAY, DEC. 7, 2016\n\nEmpathy is winning\n\n“Someone @DMRegister must think @newsmanone story is compelling but it’s getting old, repetitive & a waste of space. Not good writer either,” wrote a Twitter user who identifies as Susan Thorne and uses the handle @SueIowaGal.\n\nI don’t know this person, or at least I don’t think I do. But the tweet tweaked all the proper insecurities.\n\nMaking Weight is “getting old, repetitive & a waste of space.” Yeah, I’ve thought that, too. It worries me a great deal. Part of the reason the story is so slow moving is because weight loss and wellness are very incremental with successes and failures.\n\nOnly the gross fiction of game shows such as “The Biggest Loser” produce weight loss results in quick bursts.\n\nIn fact, a study of 14 contestants who participated in the 30-week competition regained most of their weight if not more and suffered slower metabolism, which means they were burning fewer calories than they were before they participated in the show.\n\nBut the audience, in this case, readers of this news organization, have come to believe the arc of carefully crafted fiction can be replicated in life. I assure you, it cannot. And that’s why my effort to lose more than 300 pounds began as a marathon rather than a sprint.\n\nStill, I worry that readers, who are easily distracted and often bored, will lose touch with the underlying themes of continuing to fight for wellness despite setbacks and the judgment of others who really don’t understand how hard it is making life-altering choices.\n\nSo that stung. It’s a criticism for which I have no answer other than this: This is non-fiction and I am a work in progress. I can’t and won’t alter course to make the story more entertaining. I’m working for wellness, not “likes” on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe second half — “not a good writer either” — hurt a little, too. It hurt because I am insecure. Most people are. Few of us talk about it. We bluster or hide. In these paragraphs, though, I am as stripped down and raw as I can be.\n\nThis is a difficult path because I am more vulnerable to the cruelties of social media hecklers.\n\nYes, criticism comes with this job. I understand that and even welcome it. But the tone of the internet is overwhelmingly angry. My friend Bill McClellan, a semi-retired columnist for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, calls the trend “compulsive outrage disorder.”\n\nI am old enough to remember the beginning of the modern internet. When I was a student at Drake University in the early 1990s, we had something called a VAX system.\n\nIt had primitive email and text-only web searching. If you wanted to download a single photograph from the web, you needed some fairly sophisticated computer science skills to do it.\n\nBut even then there were bulletin board systems, the precursor to the chat rooms, which I suppose are an early ancestor of social media. And the bulletin board systems on that old VAX system where overwhelmingly angry.\n\nThe most popular posts were by people who said the meanest things about others on campus, particularly those in public services like the student government or campus newspaper editor.\n\nI’ve got a lot of experience dealing with mean things said about me by people I don’t know on the internet. And I am no better at it today than I was more than 25 years ago.\n\nI harbor great insecurity that I have my job not because I earned it through merit but simply because I survived through attrition after job cuts. My bosses tell me this isn’t true and this is a manifestation of my negative self-talk.\n\nMaybe they’re right. But there are plenty of former Register employees on Facebook who gleefully jump on any of my or my colleagues’ foibles to make withering remarks that I hope at least make them feel good about themselves.\n\nWhenever I write about these kinds of worries, someone drags out the cliché: “Just grow a thicker skin.”\n\nI reject this premise. That simply gives a permission to people who are being mean for the sake of being mean. I’m a sensitive person and sometimes things said of me hurt.\n\nI recognize, too, that I say things, either in an attempt at humor, through sarcasm or simply because of my perspective, that hurt other people’s feelings. I’m truly sorry when it does. That’s never the goal.\n\nJust the other day, I got into an argument with my boss over what was ultimately a trivial matter. I lost my temper in a fit of anxiety and said things I regretted. I later apologized. She accepted. We moved forward.\n\nI write about the effect of this tweet on me not to induce sympathy from readers. Rather, I note it because mental health is as critical to wellness as physical health.\n\nI’ve noted my struggles with anxiety and depression in these columns many times. Again, this isn’t a plea for sympathy but an earnest effort to broaden understanding and engage empathy.\n\nI’m just one person who is trying to lose weight, better control my mood disorders and generally get healthy. But, in a way, I represent roughly a million Iowans considered obese and about 750,000 Iowans who live with a mental health issue.\n\nI write about my struggles for all those people who don’t have the benefit of advocacy or representation in the media. And if that means I have to take hits on social media or the comment section, so be it.\n\nBut I think empathy may be winning.\n\nI finished my second full year as a columnist for The Register in November. Since I started the job, I’ve made it a practice of saving positive emails in a folder and counting them on or near my anniversary.\n\nReaders sent 1,309 positive emails over the last year. And thank you to every single person who took the time to sit down and write their kind thoughts, well wishes and other uplifting messages. It means a lot.\n\nAs for the Twitter critic, I responded with my usual form tweet:\n\n“Gosh, it’s nice to meet you, too. Where would you like your autographed photo sent?”\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 1, 2016\n\nThe long and short of it\n\nI’m learning that you need both a long and short memory when it comes to intense exercise.\n\nFor example, in a recent workout, my coach and friend, Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay, put me through a metabolic conditioning that involved a deadlift, shoulder press and burpees.\n\nThe plan was to decrease in reps by round, starting at 10 and ending with one. The workout was capped at 20 minutes. The added twist was three burpees every two minutes.\n\nThe first round went well. I attacked the 10 deadlifts and shoulder presses with relative ease. I hit the floor for burpees with as much grace as my 440-pound frame can manage.\n\nThe round of nine went OK, but I tired quickly.\n\nBy the round of seven, I was gasping for air, a little dizzy and needed to take a seat between reps. The 20 minutes expired and I stalled after the round of seven.\n\nNate encouraged me to get a drink and focus on lowering my heart rate with slow, deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth.\n\nI was annoyed that I didn’t do better. Nate told me we would retest on the workout in a couple months. He figured I would pass all 10 rounds by then.\n\nI lacked his confidence in me, but this is where the memory question comes in.\n\nIn the short-term, I need to forget that workout results. I did the best I could. I didn’t get as far as I wanted to, but I still worked out at a strong pace for 20 minutes. There will be more weights to lift, more burpees to, um, burp, and so on.\n\nThe point is to get in as many quality repetitions in as possible even if it falls short of the goal of the planned workout. Each rep builds muscle, burns fat and increases endurance.\n\nSure, I still wish I could rip through the workout at top speed right now.\n\n“If you did,” Nate said, “what would we have to strive for?”\n\nI smirked.\n\n“I’m sure you can find a way to make it harder,” I said.\n\nThis is where a long-view is necessary. It was not that long ago that I got winded walking to the mailbox and hesitated to step off curbs because my knees would hurt too much from the girth crashing down onto the fragile, arthritic joints.\n\nA week or so back, I realized I could lift my lower leg off the floor and catch the ankle with my hand to stretch out the quads. I haven’t been able to do that since high school. We’re talking more than 23 years ago.\n\nWhen I started at CrossFit with Nate, I had to awkwardly lift my leg onto a box and lean back to stretch that quad. Now I’m much more flexible and leaner than I was eight months ago.\n\nI still get disgusted with myself when I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror coming out of the shower or see pictures of my bulbous belly.\n\nBut I have to remember that in a relatively short period, I have come a long way. And it’s valuable to measure those gains.\n\nNo, I wasn’t able to finish the workout Nate laid out before me. That’s fine. I will make it one day. The victory is making enough progress to even safely attempt such an exertion.\n\nForget short-term foibles. Celebrate long-term accomplishments. And remember every rep counts.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 22, 2016\n\nScaling back\n\nThe holidays provide a difficult challenge for anyone trying to lose weight.\n\nLast year, still early in my efforts to recover from morbid obesity, I decided to forego a traditional Thanksgiving meal at my uncle’s house. My parents and I celebrated together quietly on another evening with a menu friendlier to my diet.\n\nI’m following the same plan this year, but with an added twist. I’ve decided not to check my weight until after the first of the year.\n\nThis is not giving myself permission to blow my daily calorie goals for the entirety of the holiday season. Rather, it’s been a stressful couple of months with public tragedies and personal struggles.\n\nWeighing in, even when I expect good results, is an anxiety-riddled experience. All of the health professionals in my life repeat the same mantra: Weight is not the only, nor the best measure of health.\n\nStill, I know that more than 440 pounds is not a health weight nor sustainable if I would like to live comfortably over the next few decades.\n\nSo when the scale creeps up, I am terribly disappointed in myself because it feels like I’m doing the same work twice rather than gaining ground.\n\nThe science of this thinking is poor. Weight fluctuates daily based on a myriad of factors, including water intake and the kinds of foods you recently ate.\n\nFor example, my weight numbers tend to be goofy if I step on the scale after having taken a protein shake or within two hours of an intense workout.\n\nFurther, every time I write about my weigh-ins, particularly those after which I’ve gained weight, the internet trolls really pounce.\n\nI would love to tell you that after two years of doing this job and nearly as long chronicling my health efforts, that I have found a good way to cope with the cruel things people say to me about this or any other topic.\n\nBut I haven’t.\n\nPeople say I need to get a thicker skin. The thickness of human skin is about a tenth of an inch. Mine is no different. I just don’t like to be insulted.\n\nWhy, then, would I actively seek a career that puts me before the public eye and requires me to comment on issues that are controversial? Well, that’s a long story, but at least one reason is that stacking paragraphs is what I’m best at and fear is only a powerful force in your life if you let it limit your possibilities.\n\nStill, I’ve been on edge for a long time. Now is not the time to test my maximum endurance, which, while it is quite high, has been pushed enough for one fall.\n\nThe truth is, I’ve probably gained a few pounds in the last few weeks. I do two things when I’m anxious: spend money and eat.\n\nI’ve dug out some bags of french fries from the back of the freezer. I stabbed more than a few tator tots with my fork. One or two Marie Callender’s frozen meals, heavy with fats and carbs, landed in my microwave.\n\nThese incidents would usually lead me to a lengthy series of self-loathing. But this is a long game and, frankly, I’m tired of hating myself. I wrote last week about how anxiety has twisted my brain for several weeks and for much of the fall.\n\nI’ll go back to the scale in January. I’m not afraid of it. I just don’t need to do things that add to acute stress right now. This is my choice to make and I’m comfortable with it.\n\nI’m still going to the gym and getting stronger, more flexible and agile working with my friend and trainer, Nate Yoho, of CrossFit Merle Hay. I enjoy these sessions very much and come to view them as much as mental health therapy as physical fitness.\n\nI plan to keep my workout schedule through the holidays. We’ll get back on the scale after the first of the year. For now, I want to focus on fellowship of friends and family, calming thoughts and activities and making the best food choices available during a challenging season.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 17, 2016\n\nSetting it aside\n\nThe new day’s sunlight filtered through the vertical blinds in my living room when I finally realized I had been up all night.\n\nI looked at the bright red digits on the clock on my TV stand. The time was shortly after 7 a.m. on a Sunday.\n\nI was wide awake and had been for nearly 20 hours. Normally, this kind of insomnia is associated with the panic attacks symptomatic of my acute anxiety disorder.\n\nBut I did not feel anxious. I did not feel anything.\n\nI just kept flitting between small projects for no good reason.\n\nIt started with finishing a page in my “Doctor Who” adult coloring book, an activity specifically designed to be calming.\n\nUsually, that works. This time, though, I became hyper-focused on finishing the page before I went to bed.\n\nI remember going into the bedroom at about 2 a.m. That’s late for bedtime, but not terrible for a former night police reporter who enjoys the quiet solitude of what Frank Sinatra described as the “wee, small hours of the morning.”\n\nI grimaced at the stack of comic books, magazines, half-read paperbacks, computer cords and other clutter gathered by my bedside.\n\nI decided it must be organized. This resulted in an hours-long reorganization of bookshelves and some furniture in my bedroom.\n\nIn the sorting, I discovered a small stack of 50-cent comics I bought at Black Medicine Comics. They were well-worn books from my childhood, “reader copies” as the collectors say.\n\nSome years ago, I bought an old-fashioned spindle rack similar to the one I bought comics off of at Montross Pharmacy in Winterset when I was a boy.\n\nI keep the rack in a corner of the living room. I thought I would put the comics on the rack and go to bed.\n\nThen I realized I didn’t like the fact the comic rack was in the corner and I couldn’t really see the books I’d just put on it.\n\nAnother hours-long reorganization of furniture began.\n\nA text from my girlfriend appeared on my phone at 10 a.m. I was still up. I told her I’d been up all night. I didn’t really know why.\n\nShe asked me if I’d taken my depression and anxiety medication on time. Sometimes I wait to take my medication so I can finish writing a stack of paragraphs or some other activity. But I took them at their appointed time, 10 p.m.\n\nWe exchanged a few texts. She urged me to get some rest. I showered and went to bed, but did not feel tired. I eventually fell asleep.\n\nI don’t remember what time I woke up Sunday afternoon. I talked with a few friends by phone. I napped through some dull NFL games on TV.\n\nThe reminder chirped on my smartphone. It was time to take my medication. I did. I went into the bedroom to read and get ready for a new week.\n\nThen I looked at the stack of books I reorganized just a day before. Wouldn’t they look better if I stacked them in a completely different way?\n\nFinally, just after midnight on Monday morning, I called my therapist’s after-hours service. He called back right away.\n\nI explained the patterns of behavior over the past two days. I couldn’t figure it out. I wasn’t manic, at least I didn’t feel that way.\n\nMy therapist talked me back through recent events. I helped cover the ambush killing of two Des Moines-metro police officers. Though I am not a police officer, I have a great affinity for the men and women who do the job.\n\nThen I wrote about my childhood friend Liz fighting terminal cancer. I recently learned another friend, Steve, who used to have the desk next to me at the Register, was “in the home stretch,” as he put it, with pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd then there was the election. Sure, the popular thing to do is call people upset at the presidential results “crybabies.” But good friends of mine were terribly sad and angry. I could feel it. And it hurt.\n\n“That’s a lot of stuff you’ve got going on in a short amount of time,” my therapist said.\n\n“So why am I playing Tetris with my furniture?” I asked.\n\n“It’s just something to keep your mind off the things you don’t want to talk about,” my therapist said. “Your mind engages in these projects so it doesn’t have to think about what hurts.”\n\nThat made sense. It had been a rough few weeks. Too many carbs slipped into my diet. My motivation to hit the gym practically evaporated despite the supportive atmosphere. I felt wild and out of control.\n\n“I talk to a lot of people who are feeling the same way,” my therapist said. “Do you know what I tell them? Set it aside. There’s nothing you can do about it right now. You have to live your life.”\n\nThis seemingly simple advice helped me unlock “sleep mode.”\n\nI’m still very anxious, maybe as bad as I have been in a very anxious year. But I’m doing my best to handle it, keep commenting on the passing parade and telling stories.\n\nIt isn't easy, but, then, nobody ever promised us easy.\n\nWEDNESDAY, NOV. 9, 2016\n\nClearing the mechanism\n\nI thought I was processing the grief that came with the killings of two Des Moines-metro police officers as well as could be expected until I drove to the gym last week.\n\nIn the strip mall home of CrossFit Merle Hay, a vendor put up fencing and signage for a Christmas tree lot. I thought of Des Moines Police Sgt. Tony Beminio and Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin.\n\nTheir families were weeks away from experiencing their first Thanksgiving and Christmas without their loved ones. Beminio was the father of three. I thought about my first Christmas without my dad nearly 28 years ago.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot and parked a few rows away from the gym. I composed myself and walked in.\n\nMy trainer and friend, Nate Yoho, seems to inherently read moods. After stretches, we started a deadlift. Deadlifting is my favorite weightlifting exercise. I can’t say why. I just like it.\n\nI pressed my mind into thinking about my form as I yanked 272 pounds from the floor for five sets of three repetitions. We did another round of three sets of three reps at 250 pounds.\n\nOn good days at the gym, my mind locks into the exercise and all noise both internally and externally fades away.\n\nIt’s a wonderful mindset. Your body strains, yet you ignore the exhaustion in favor of one more rep. You don’t even hear the music blasting on the gym speakers.\n\nThe best representation I can think of for this comes from the mediocre 1999 baseball movie “For Love of the Game.” Kevin Costner plays an aging pitcher throwing a perfect game on the last day of his career. Early in the movie, the camera pans across the jeering Yankees fans and the cacophony of noise inside Yankee Stadium. He looks in at the catcher and thinks to himself, “Clear the mechanism.” With that, the noise around him fades away and it is just pitcher, catcher and batter.\n\nThis level of engagement is rare for me. Often the exhaustion breaks my concentration.\n\nBut the elite athletes at the gym, like Nate, are practiced enough at the mental game that they can lock in more frequently and it is a marvelous thing to witness.\n\nI could not “clear the mechanism” last week, at least not in terms of getting into a zone where I was attacking the exercises without awareness of how tired I was.\n\nYet as I worked through 20 minutes of metabolic conditioning that involved rounds of carrying 53-pound kettle bells in both hands, rowing and sit-ups, my mind at least temporarily pushed out the grief.\n\nMy session ended as they usually do, with me panting on the floor in a pool of sweat, feeling an odd mixture of accomplishment and annoyance that I could not do more.\n\nAs I drank my protein shake, Nate and I talked about the fallen officers. I told him about the Christmas tree lot. Nate and I became friends after I wrote a story about the loss of his wife, Laura, to cancer three years ago.\n\nWe both paused to consider that in the beginning, everyone tries to help you cope with grief. But eventually, the ham sandwiches are all gone, people go home to their lives and you are left with a great emptiness that remains for the rest of your life.\n\nNate still feels the loss of his wife. I still miss my dad.\n\nMost days, both of us are able to “clear the mechanism,” as it were, and live our lives.\n\nBut some days, the hurt feels raw and fresh. And you are left with only one solution: Keep moving forward.\n\nTHURSDAY, NOV. 3, 2016\n\nStrange sensation\n\nI visited my doctor, Shauna Basener, while I was on vacation last month.\n\nThe appointment was our first since she moved from a clinic in West Des Moines to the McFarland Clinic in Ames.\n\nI decided to follow her despite the extra travel time because I feel a strong sense of trust, rapport and open communication with Shauna as a doctor and a person.\n\nThis relationship is critical while dealing with chronic health issues. In my case, those issues are morbid obesity, high blood pressure and arthritis in my knees and lower back.\n\nIn one of our first visits, Shauna won my trust when she told me to stop taking an iron supplement because my blood tests showed it was unnecessary.\n\n“The best medicine is no medicine,” she said.\n\nThis is a philosophy I wholly support. This is not to say I oppose medication or regular preventative care.\n\nThe idea is to help the body function properly without the assistance of medications or supplements. I still take two medications for blood pressure, three medications for mental health issues, a daily vitamin and a fish oil supplement.\n\nBut in the time I’ve worked with Shauna, I’ve changed my physical well-being enough to stop taking medication for type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\nMy blood pressure reading was good enough that Shauna considered lowering the dosage of my blood pressure medication or dropping it altogether.\n\nThis idea astounded me. I thought once a person went on blood pressure medication, it became a permanent part of the routine.\n\nBut the weight loss and increase in physical activity over the last 19 months improved my health enough that some of the chronic conditions have eased.\n\nMy blood tests during this visit showed similar promise.\n\nMy A1C test, which gives doctors a picture of my average blood sugar level for about three months, was the second-lowest (that’s good) since I began recovery.\n\nMy cholesterol levels were within acceptable ranges and improving.\n\nAnd my weight was 444.6 pounds – a loss of 118.6 pounds since I began the journey nearly 600 days ago and also my lowest mark to date.\n\nI gained 13 pounds between August and September and the thought distressed me so I feel into a deep funk complete with the usual round of negative self-talk.\n\nBetween September and my October physical, I lost those 13 pounds and three more.\n\nThis inspired an unusual emotion: hope.\n\nGetting healthier means, barring accident or catastrophe, I likely will live longer.\n\nMost of my life, I’ve thought about the end of my life.\n\nMy dad died when I was 13. My mom died when I was 14. My dad was sickly for the last several years of his life.\n\nI used to write my will and testament on wide-ruled notebook paper that I kept in my desk because I thought that was something I needed to do.\n\nOne of my favorite teachers in fourth grade died of leukemia. I remember staying home from school the day after she died and trying to will myself to die because I didn’t want to face school without her kind face and gentle manner.\n\nThroughout all my struggles – health, financial, psychological or vocational – in my 41 years, I have always thought about how my life would end.\n\nI assumed it would end badly, with lots of pain and suffering or, as I have often admitted, by my own hand.\n\nNow, though, there is a good chance that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. This represents a dramatic shift in perspective.\n\nIf I’m going to live, what am I to make of my life? I need to reshape my outlook.\n\nIt’s daunting, but it beats planning your own funeral.\n\nTHURSDAY, OCT. 13, 2016\n\nA path forward\n\nThe pain lanced through my lower back like an electric shock.\n\nThe time was about 3 a.m. I tried to sit up in bed, but my lower back hurt so much I actually cried out.\n\nI tested the boundaries of movement. Articulation at the waist hurt the most. With some painful effort, I threw my legs over the side of the bed and pulled myself up to a standing position.\n\nI equated the harshness of the pain to the back injury that started this journey to recover from morbid obesity 19 months ago.\n\nI gingerly shuffled to the closet and fished out a prescription muscle relaxant I keep in case of emergencies. I swallowed one with some water and slowly walked into the living room.\n\nI tried to think of what might have caused this flare up. My workout at CrossFit Merle Hay earlier in the day went fine. I was tired but felt no pain or stiffness.\n\nTrainer Nate Yoho wanted to try a new movement, something called a sumo deadlift. I stood on two boxes a foot tall. I squatted and reached past my feet to grab a 35-pound kettlebell from the floor. Then I stood.\n\nThe challenge was almost like pulling 35 pounds out of a hole in the ground.\n\nAt the time we did the exercise, I felt the usual strains associated with a workout, but nothing spectacular.\n\nWe finished with a metabolic conditioning cycle that involved kettlebell swings and the rowing machine. I walked – and partially ran – a mile.\n\nI drank a protein shake and a recovery drink. I sat around for a while to watch the most experienced athletes prepare for an upcoming competition.\n\nI returned to my home office to stack paragraphs and knocked off for the day in the early evening.\n\nI recalled no incidents that would have set off this tight, aching back.\n\nYet there I sat in my living room, waiting for the pain killer to kick in propped up by some extra pillows in the small of my back and barely able to move.\n\nI worried the injury would stop the progress I’ve made at the gym in recent weeks. Since a recent setback in weight loss, I’ve shifted focus from the scale to what I can do with my body.\n\nI’ll return to the scale soon enough, but confidence comes quicker and more practically through training than it does in those few anxious seconds before I step on a scale.\n\nThe pain, combined with the sluggishness that comes with muscle relaxers, sidelined me from the gym later that day.\n\nI hate to miss sessions, which is in itself something of a victory. I never thought I would enjoy training as much as I do and in such a variety of ways, from the physical exertion and strength gains to camaraderie of the trainers and athletes.\n\nI also hate to miss sessions because even though I know recovery is just as important as exercise, my brain – twisted by anxiety – always believes a missed session means my body begins to atrophy and I’ll lose all the strength and mobility I’ve gained.\n\nIt’s an irrational worry, as most of mine are, but it’s something I wrestle with in these situations.\n\nOn the day I took off and during my regular off day, I tried to stretch as often as I could. I bent over and put my palms on the floor. I cycled through the exercises I learned in physical therapy when I originally hurt my back.\n\nThe pain lingered at varying intensities, but by the end of the second day off I started to feel better. My back still hurt – especially after long periods sitting or lying down.\n\nBut I found myself texting Nate, pledging to be at our next session. I wasn’t fully recovered, but Nate is used to working around injuries.\n\nHe recently had a client with a torn bicep who came in and managed to work out. My injury was far less severe than that.\n\nI took several lessons from this frightening recurrence of back pain. First, I am in better shape and stronger than I was 19 months ago. That means my body recovers faster even when it really hurts.\n\nAnd secondly, while I might worry that every pitfall will be catastrophic, I’m slowly beginning to understand that not everything is going to end in disaster.\n\nThis is something my mental health therapist has been working on with me for years, as have my family, friends and loved ones.\n\nBut it took working out at CrossFit with Nate to finally realize there is always a path forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCT. 5, 2016\n\nCast of characters\n\nSometimes I watch them, the other athletes and trainers, as I sit on the wooden bench at the front of CrossFit Merle Hay, dabbing the sweat from my bald head and recovering my breath.\n\nIt still feels like an exaggeration to refer to myself as an “athlete” in this gym filled with men and women who look like Greek marble statues come to life.\n\nBut Nate Yoho, the gym’s owner, insists upon it. Once you heft the first weight, pull the first row and walk the first step, to Nate, you are an athlete – his athlete.\n\nWhen my workouts end, I drink a protein shake and suck water from an aluminum bottle.\n\nThey truly come in all shapes and sizes, both athletes and trainers.\n\nThere is 72-year-old Denny Joe, survivor of three open-heart surgeries. A doctor told him he would never run again. He runs nearly every day on a high school track near his home.\n\nHe works with Nate, who helps him with flexibility, strength and stamina. On a recent day, I watched Denny Joe prop himself up on his forearms and rest his ankles on a box. He held a ridged position with his abs tightened for 2 minutes. They call the exercise planking. I call it amazing.\n\nOn the days when my arthritic knees bark and I want to stay in my comfortable oversized office chair, I think of Denny Joe, the septuagenarian superman who still runs when they told him he could not.\n\nVan Marshall works alongside Nate as a trainer. He hurt his hamstring recently and then hurt it again. This stops normal people from intense workout. It turned Van into a carpenter.\n\nHe assembled workout equipment that allowed him to exercise without straining his injured muscle a third time.\n\nMy favorite: He wound a thick rope around a sled and stacked heavy weight plates atop it. With another athlete, they took turns pulling the heavy sled across the floor. While one pulled, the other did pushups.\n\nWhen I gasp for air and think I have no more to give, I think of Van and push just a little harder.\n\nMichelle is another trainer at CrossFit. She works with a young, overweight middle school girl. She pours her heart into inspiring the girl to embrace fitness the way she embraces reading and academic achievement.\n\nMichelle starts each session by walking beside the girl. I don’t know what they talk about and it’s none of my business.\n\nBut in those dark moments when I want to quit because it feels hopeless or the chemical malfunctions in my brain turn my thoughts against me, I think of Michelle and the culture of this gym. I know I never walk alone.\n\nI watch Nate as he works with other athletes. He greets everyone with a smile. He encourages, corrects, directs and pushes.\n\nHe is in top physical condition, stronger and faster than he has ever been in his 33 years. He recently set a series of personal records in competition-style workouts. Had they been in a competition, he would have finished 17th in the region and in the top 100 in the world.\n\nNate relates the accomplishments with the giddiness of a small boy. Yet I witness him reflect that same enthusiasm and joy for the gains of his athletes.\n\nWords fail to accurately reflect how much I respect this man, how honored I am by his friendship. He played minor league baseball but never cracked the big leagues, the kind of disappointment that turns many people into round-bellied storytellers at the end of the bar, loudly reliving their glory days to anyone within earshot.\n\nBut Nate rebuilt. He came home to Des Moines, became a trainer, met the love of his life, got married and opened his own gym.\n\nThen Nate lost his wife to cancer a few months before his daughter was born by surrogate. That’s the kind of twist of fate that could crack a man.\n\nNate rebuilt again. His world rotates around daughter Caralyn, who turns 3 in November. Nate plans to move into a larger site to accommodate the growth at his gym.\n\nSometimes I look at myself in the mirror and grimace at what I see. I think withering thoughts about my lumpy body, saggy skin and all the mistakes and overindulgence that led to that point.\n\nThen I think of Nate, who never judged me not on my first wheezing day when I could barely lift a 45-pound bar without pain lancing through my back and not on my most recent workout, when I tossed a tire, cradled a kettlebell under my chin while squatting and pulled ring rows for 22 minutes in a row.\n\nI think of this man who helps me three times a week push harder, get stronger and be better. And I know he does it because he cares. He wants me to succeed, sustain and achieve.\n\nSelf-discipline is a wonderful concept and not to be underestimated, but neither is teamwork. With my bent mindset, I give up on myself often.\n\nYet with this cast of characters working so hard to help themselves and each other, I shrug off the anxiety and doubt despite internal misgivings.\n\nI need only look at the faces of my teammates to find the faith to keep moving forward.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 27, 2016\n\nA better kind of scale\n\nI needed a win.\n\nThe weigh-in that showed a gain of 13 pounds over the previous month brought my spirits low. I felt as if the work I had done in increasingly intense workouts over recent months was in vain.\n\nI had the vague, unrealistic fear that I was creeping back to the nearly 600 pounds I was before I began this journey.\n\nNate Yoho, my friend and trainer at CrossFit Merle Hay, seemed to sense this when I arrived at the gym.\n\nWe started with a deadlift, my favorite weightlifting exercise. It’s the one that reminds me I once couldn’t carry a few bags of groceries without hurting myself.\n\nNow I can pull hundreds of pounds off the floor without a problem.\n\nI can’t see the muscles in my back, but my girlfriend says they are firmer, and I feel stronger.\n\nNate and I started, as always, with 10 reps of just the 45-pound bar. We started to warm up, increasing weight and decreasing repetitions.\n\nThe plates started stacking thick on both sides of the bar.\n\n“I see we're going with the no-messing-around weight today,” I said to Nate. I may have used a different word than “messing.”\n\n“We’re going for it,” Nate said.\n\nBy “it,” Nate meant a personal record. I set one several months ago at 331 pounds.\n\nAt the time, Nate said I probably could have done more, but I began to lose my form — which can lead to injury — on my final reps, so we stopped.\n\nThis time, with form locked in, I pulled from the ground to my knees, keeping my back straight, my chest up and leading with my shoulders.\n\nNate kept sliding on more plates. Finally, we reached 352 pounds, which would best the previous record by 21 pounds.\n\nI squatted into position, set my heels and yanked that bar to my waist. I held it for a second before I let the bar drop and slam to the floor.\n\nNate and I bumped fists. That felt damned good.\n\nWe dropped the weight down to 225 pounds for five sets of five reps. I focused on the form that sometimes fails as I try to set records.\n\nI squeezed my shoulder blades together and led with my upper body as I stood. I worked the rounds.\n\nWith each round completed, Nate fist-pumped on the side. He bubbled with jubilation.\n\n“This is what I do this for,” he said. “This is about you getting your life back. You’re no longer a prisoner in your own body or your own home. You don’t have to worry about hurting yourself doing everyday things.”\n\nHe reminded me I pulled 352 pounds off the floor and was closing in on a full body-weight deadlift — a major accomplishment in weightlifting, especially for a man of my girth.\n\nThen he pointed out I finished 25 reps of 225 pounds. No amount of groceries I bought was going to weigh that. That strength was mine now, to nurture and build upon.\n\nAnd that felt even better than the personal record.\n\nFor our metabolic conditioning, Nate retested me on a workout I completed twice during our time together.\n\nThe set involved declining reps on three separate exercises for time, beginning at 10 and decreasing by one until the last round was one rep.\n\nThe three exercises were rowing on the machine, push-ups and pulling a 20-pound medicine ball from the floor and throwing it down.\n\nMy first time was 18 minutes — 18 seconds. The second time I ran the gauntlet, my time went up — in part because I fiddled with the straps on the rowing machine too much.\n\nThis time, though, I felt a burning sense of purpose, a desire to rip this thing to shreds.\n\nI don’t remember much about the metabolic conditioning series other than when I felt even the slightest sense of fatigue, I screamed to myself in my head, “Next time, you do one less than this time.”\n\nWhen I pounded the medicine ball on the floor for a final time, I fell to my knees and rolled over on my back. Sweat rolled back off my bald head and pooled on the gym floor.\n\nI could barely breathe.\n\n“Time,” I wheezed to Nate.\n\n“12:29,” he said. “You just beat your old best time by almost 6 minutes. You went to a different mental place to do that.”\n\nNate shook my hand. I stayed on the floor.\n\nMy chest heaved. My heart rate slowed. I smiled.\n\nI’ll take this measure of fitness over the scale every single time.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 20, 2016\n\nSetbacks and commitments\n\nMy shirt hung heavy on my sweaty frame.\n\nThe day’s workout at CrossFit Merle Hay felt good. Coach Nate Yoho put me through a timed metabolic conditioning circuit.\n\nIt involved a row, followed by a bike ride followed by a 200 meter walk with a 50-pound barbell in each hand.\n\nThe thing took 20 minutes, 10 seconds. We both wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes, but the strength of my grip faded on the back half of the 200-meter. I need to stop one more time before the finish. It cost me a few seconds.\n\nStill, I felt good. I thought of all the things I could do now that I wasn’t able to do when I when I started at the gym about nine months ago.\n\nI probably am the physically strongest I have ever been and, outside of playing basketball as a sophomore at Winterset High School, this is probably the most sustained physical activity I’ve ever done.\n\nI drank my protein shake and a recovery drink. I chatted with Nate. We talked about how my form had improved in various lifts and exercises. I am beginning to develop body awareness.\n\nI felt good and strong. I decided to drive over to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center to check my weight.\n\nWorkouts continued to increase intensity over recent weeks. The sweat and grind must surely produce a positive result.\n\nJacque Schwartz, my regular dietician, wasn’t available. Another professional familiar with these paragraphs took the measurement.\n\nMy jaw hung agape at the results. I gained 13 pounds since Aug. 11. It was the biggest rollback since I began recovery from morbid obesity more than 18 months ago.\n\nI held back tears as I slid on my shoes and socks. I hustled out to my car and collapsed into the driver’s seat. Despondency washed over me. Boy, the jerks on social media were going to love this. I can almost see the all the creative fat jokes being crafted once this column is published.\n\nThe first thought I had was to take the car down to Iowa Highway 5 south of the airport and get it up as fast as I could go and smash it into the bridge truss at top speed.\n\nI have suicidal thoughts sometimes. It is painful and embarrassing to admit, but it is true. They come from a combination of thinking errors, adverse childhood experiences and the malfunction of brain chemistry that goes along with chronic depression and acute anxiety.\n\nThis does not mean I am actively suicidal. It means that sometimes when I struggle, my mind visits upon those thoughts, usually exceptionally briefly. I first had suicidal thoughts in fourth grade after my favorite teacher died. I think once your brain cracks the seal on that kind of thinking, it always lurks in your mind even if you aren't going to act upon it. Author Susanna Kaysen, who lives with borderline personality disorder, described the persistent, illogical nature of suicidal thinking in her autobiographical book, “Girl, Interrupted.”\n\n“Once you’ve posed that question, it won’t go away,” she wrote.\n\nThat’s how suicidal thinking is for me. I think about it, usually when I screw up or believe I have disappointed people who give me their love and put their trust in me. Through behavioral therapy, I’ve learned to manage suicidal thoughts. The first thought I have is that I don’t want to cause pain to the people I love, especially Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nThen I think of the poor cop who has to see whatever is left of me at the accident scene. Or I consider the fact I might survive the attempt but permanently and severely injured.\n\nAll these thoughts pass in a few seconds or less. Usually, the real problems – sadness and disappointment – are revealed. Sadness and disappointment are rational reactions to negative events. These I can work with, unpleasant though they may be.\n\nOne note of caution here: Always take seriously someone who talks openly about suicide. I have a lot of experience wrangling these thoughts and an excellent support structure in place, but others — especially adolescents — don't have the experience to know the pain will pass.\n\nMy boss read these paragraphs and called to check on me, as one should. We had a talk. I assured her I was OK, just going through a rough patch. Talking is always a good idea. The worst that can happen is a person tells to buzz off or that they are fine. The best that can happen is they ask for help.\n\nI called my therapist and told him I was in a spiral. He asked me what might have caused the weight gain.\n\nMy best guess was too many carbohydrates. I indulged in one too many English muffins, lasagna and pizza a few times in the previous month.\n\nMy therapist emphasized that weight is but one measure of success. I was stronger. I looked better. I found a new community at the gym. I knew that, but when overwhelmed by the disappointment, I could not see it.\n\nMy therapist asked me what my plan was. I decided to cut my daily calorie intake from 2,500 calories to 2,250. I planned to more vigorously eschew carbohydrates.\n\nI also planned to break up my total calorie intake into three or four smaller meals instead of some snacks or protein supplements and one large, high-calorie meal.\n\nBy the time I finished detailing the plan, a kind of calm settled in. My therapist always says it helps to say things out loud. The negative thoughts sound silly and the positive ones make more sense.\n\nI texted the bad news to Nate.\n\n“Life happens,” he said. “I’ve never had a client who lost more than 100 pounds that didn’t slide back. Did you think you were going to be the first?”\n\nAt first, I thought Nate unsympathetic. Then I remembered a story he told me while he was playing minor league baseball some years ago.\n\nHe went through a 0-for-40 slump. He was the fourth outfielder on the team and only played once or twice a week.\n\n“I’d go 0-for-5 and sit for four days,” Nate said. “Nobody wanted to be around me. I was in a bad mood all the time.”\n\nThe lesson, though, is that nobody bats 1.000. I made some bad decisions with food and it caught up with me. I already had a plan in place to improve.\n\nYes, the usual trolls would come in via social media or email with their scolds and finger-wagging about the fat man who got fatter.\n\nI don’t have to write about the dark places my mind goes or the pain I feel when I don’t reach a goal. I choose to do so because setbacks, mistakes and failures are a part of recovery. Pretending that they aren't is simply a lie.\n\nSuch challenges matter less than what one does about them once they’re presented.\n\nI was back at the gym Monday afternoon, lifting weights, doing push-ups, burpies, squats, dumbbell snatches and kettlebell swings.\n\nThe journey continued.\n\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 13, 2016\n\nGetting to the good stuff\n\nForty seconds remained in the 15-minute workout.\n\nAt CrossFit Merle Hay, where I continue my ongoing battle against morbid obesity, they call it “AMRAP” – as many repetitions as possible in a set time period.\n\nThe menu of exercises included five “wall balls,” which involves squatting with a 20-pound medicine ball at your chest and standing up, throwing the ball to a mark on the wall in front of you and catching it, a 10-calorie exercise bike ride and 15 sit-ups.\n\nNate changed the form on the sit-ups. In the past, when my belly was larger and my back weaker, the goal was to get my hands to my knees.\n\nThis day he wanted me to get my hands to my toes, tapping my fingertips on the 70-pound dumbbells I hooked my toes under while doing the activity.\n\nWhen he first described it, I thought I couldn’t do it. I found I was able to do it with relative ease. This, of course, changed as the workout continued and my body tired.\n\nThe workout was near complete and I’d made three full rounds and was two sit-ups away from four complete rounds. But my abdominal muscles – I promise there are some under all of the fat rolls – started to fail.\n\nI needed to hit two more sit-ups with 40 seconds. I hit one. But on the final try, my muscles just surrendered and I fell back.\n\nNate hollered for me to try again, counting down the seconds on the clock.\n\nI tried and got about two-thirds of the way there, but my gut muscles had no more left to give.\n\nI rolled over and pulled my knees to my chest. I sweated and gasped on the rubbery gym floor. Nate gave me a fist bump. The final tally marked 119 reps.\n\nThis is the good stuff, I thought, out of gas and exhausted.\n\nHow did it come to pass that such a feeling of exhaustion became “the good stuff?”\n\nIn recent weeks, this job had been getting to me. I live with acute anxiety disorder. My brain twists small problems into big problems and sometimes no problems into big problems.\n\nI was really struggling with a few work-related things: jerks on social media, worries about convincing a broad audience that it’s worth paying for the content in The Register and so on.\n\nMy bosses assured me they were pleased with my work and that they were happy with how my paragraphs connected with our audience.\n\nMy brain was misfiring and I was in a loop. And when you’re an anxiety sufferer in the middle of a downward spiral, very few things can jolt you back to clarity.\n\nI worked with my therapist. He can usually do it, but I wasn’t settling to a normal rhythm. Everything felt uncomfortable and overwhelming.\n\nI’ll talk to my girlfriend about her cats or my buddy Paul from Memphis about stupid TV shows and bad movies, which is nearly all of them.\n\nBut that nagging feeling that my life was out of control and everything was going to end badly persisted. I woke up in the morning in a nearly full panic and found myself extra surly and suspicious.\n\nIt reached a point where I wanted to write a column that poked fun at one of Iowa’s sacred subjects but I was afraid to do it because of the beating I would take on social media, through email and phone calls.\n\nThat was the moment I knew I needed to take a timeout. I took FMLA leave to clear my head and bring the anxiety symptoms back into manageable ranges.\n\nI’m an insecure person. Lots of people are, maybe most of us are. I want to be liked and loved, but I’ve picked a strange occupation to seek adulation in the age of angry discourse augmented by social media.\n\nStill, an important part of my job is challenging the audience with ideas counter to the status quo. If I’m afraid to do that, I can’t be the kind of columnist I want to be and I might as well turn in my laptop.\n\nI took 11 days off, including the Labor Day holiday and two weekends. I rested. I read. I eschewed social media. I hung out with friends. I tried to get my sleep schedule back on track.\n\nAnd I hit the gym.\n\nI played catch with Nate and Van Marshall, a trainer at the gym. I ran through the workouts despite arthritic knees aching with the barometric pressure shifts during a rainy period.\n\nAnd the days I was at the gym, I felt settled, even gruntled. There’s science behind this. Workouts produce endorphins and serotonin, which lead to better moods and less anxiety.\n\nBut the routine of it – working out to near-exhaustion, hanging out with the crew – was as important as any of the physicality involved.\n\nAbout eight days into my sabbatical, I woke up and felt fine. My gut was calm. My brain was active and eager to be at the gym.\n\n“Today is the first day in about two months that I’ve felt good,” I said to Nate.\n\n“It’s about time,” Nate said.\n\nI agreed.\n\nBack to the recent workout: I lay on the floor in a kind of sultry daze.\n\n“Did you see there is a Part C?” Nate said. He meant there was another round to the workout. My brain cursed him, but I fought my way to my feet.\n\nHe wanted me to walk or run a mile, not for time. I restrained my profanity again. I drank a protein shake. I got my wind back. I hit the bricks.\n\nMy mind worked ahead. As I navigated the bumpy, pockmarked pavement behind the gym, I already was thinking of climbing the long hill on the access road.\n\nBy the time I was at the access road, I was thinking about the turn back to the building to complete the first lap.\n\nMy mind was working at the same frenetic pace it does during anxiety attacks. But instead of shredding my psyche with worry, it was planning my attack to finish this mile in less than 20 minutes.\n\nI jogged the last 100 yards or so and finished at 18 minutes, 54 seconds. I was out of breath. I sipped a recovery drink and sweated on the bench while Nate worked with other clients.\n\nYes, I thought, this really is the good stuff.\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 30, 2016\n\nHead games\n\nThe kettle bell with the green stripes at the base of the handle weighs 53 pounds.\n\nRust peeks through portions of its rounded base where the black paint has chipped away.\n\nChalk dust coats the ball with clean spots made by drips of sweat striking the lead weight in a series of swings to end a grueling workout.\n\nThrough the loop on the handle, you can see the obscured image of a man exhausted, splayed out on the floor with his seemingly lifeless hand laying on the soft padded floor of Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay gym.\n\nThis portly paragraph-stacker unceremoniously dropped the kettle bell to the floor after 20 swings and collapsed in to what Nate calls “the CrossFit position.”\n\nI began the workout with some trepidation. My arthritic knees ached with the recent humidity and volatile barometric pressure.\n\nRecent workouts challenged the joints’ stability with jump roping and light jogging. I warmed up slowly on the humid day.\n\nAs always, Nate asked how my body felt. I warned him my knees ached, but, as always, I was not at the gym to be comfortable.\n\nWe began with an exercise called “thrusters.” The lift involves putting weight on a bar, holding it at the tops of your shoulders in front of your body with your elbows pointed out.\n\nYou squat and then thrust up from the squat, careful to keep your heels on the floor, and then push the weight above your head as your hips swing forward.\n\nMy knees hurt, but they eventually loosened up or enough adrenaline flowed that I did not notice the ache as badly.\n\nThe cardio portion of the workout came next. Nate lined up nine activities to be completed for time. It began with a 20-calorie row, a 100-meter run (run!), and 30-calorie bike ride, followed by another row, run, ride and run.\n\nThe capstone was 20 swings of the 53-pound kettle bell.\n\nLet’s pause for a moment to consider the notion of a 447-pound man running. Brian Brown will not be recruiting me for any special events at next year’s Drake Relays.\n\nBut running is something I’ve largely avoided since maybe playing a few pickup basketball games at Bell Center when I was a Drake University student more than 20 years ago.\n\nWhen I began this recovery from morbid obesity, a 156-foot walk was enough to drench me with sweat and force me to sit down, near complete exhaustion.\n\nI was in slightly better shape when Nate invited me to his gym in late January this year. But running and jumping were far from my mind.\n\nYet in recent weeks, we’ve started running and jumping. It’s difficult and taxes my knees in particular.\n\nBut my knees are strong. A doctor took X-rays when I weighed close to 600 pounds. There was still good cartilage and space between the bones. I was simply putting a lot of pressure on the joints, which caused the arthritis.\n\nNow I’m challenging those joints again, though with a body that is much lighter. Still, they hurt. Yet I keep pushing them. Because something strange is happening to me.\n\nI want to see how hard I can really go.\n\nI am good at rowing and the stationary bike. I keep a good pace at those, even when fatigue sets in. Running is new.\n\nNate said I could walk the 100 meters if I needed to. I pledged to run all four rounds, even if it was barely a jog.\n\nI stayed on the balls of my feet and dug in when I needed to climb the hill back to the gym.\n\nI regained my breath on the bike or rower. I still went hard, but I’ve become strong enough in those exercises that I can perform at a higher level and still recoup some of my energy for activities that are more taxing.\n\nNate set no time goal for me, but mentally I wanted to finish in less than 20 minutes. On the last 100 meters, my creaky knees really ached on the downhill run alongside the gym’s building.\n\nI turned to run back to the gym and I turned it on. Now, I don’t want anyone getting visions of Usain Bolt here. It was a slow, plodding, clopping graceless run.\n\nBut for a man of my girth on this point in my journey, it was a damn Olympic sprint.\n\nThe last round was 20 kettle bell swings. My breath was shallow. I decided to break it down into four sets of five swings. I made the first five and took a break.\n\nMy gray T-shirt was heavy with sweat. My arms and legs were slick.\n\nI swung five more and thought for a moment that I did not have two rounds in me. I leaned on the stationary bike for support. I gasped for air.\n\nNate suggested I try six swings to get more than halfway home. I decided I wanted to be done.\n\nI swung the final 10 swings in the third round. The kettle bell landed on the floor. I followed, spent and gasping.\n\nThe elapsed time was 17 minutes, 3 seconds.\n\nNate shook my hand. He let me be for a few minutes while I regained my breath.\n\nI propped myself up on my elbows.\n\nNate said I’d been hitting the floor a lot after workouts recently. I said he was pushing me harder.\n\nHe corrected me.\n\n“No, you’re breaking through mentally,” Nate said. “You’re going to that place in your head that really wants to push as far as you can go.”\n\nI understood exactly what he meant. Look at all I can do now when 18 months ago, exhausted after 156 feet, I asked Stefanie Kirk, physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, if I had any hope.\n\nNow my mindset is: Just how far can I go?\n\nTUESDAY, AUG. 23, 2016\n\nJump, jump around\n\nI bought a jump rope.\n\nIf Vegas took odds on what this paragraph stacker would buy, jump rope would not have even been on the board.\n\nBut I bought one because my trainer, CrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho, said it was time to integrate jumping into my workouts.\n\nWe worked on some light jumping, just a few inches off the ground. My arthritic knees took the pounding fairly well.\n\nSo I shelled out almost $25 for a jump rope. This isn’t actually a rope. It’s a thin aluminum cable with slim handles with rubber grips.\n\nThe elegant little thing is a far cry from the nylon jump rope with wood handles I received for participating in Jump Rope for Heart in fifth grade.\n\nScores of jump ropes hang on hooks at the gym. But Nate worried that none would be long enough for my 6-foot-4 frame.\n\nSo I invested in exercise equipment. It even comes with a small nylon storage bag to keep it tightly and tidily wound inside my gym bag.\n\nI have not jumped rope since it was a unit in physical education class, likely in elementary or middle school. I recall charts on the wall with various tricks one could do.\n\nMy favorite was “side swing,” which involved swinging the rope on each side of your body and no actual jumping.\n\nBut this is a new era. CrossFit athletes do something called “double-unders,” in which they spin the rope so quickly and jump high enough that the rope clears their feet twice for every jump.\n\nThis big-and-tall man is not ready for double-unders. I am barely capable of single jumps. But once the jump rope arrived, Nate decided to incorporate it into the metabolic conditioning.\n\nThe act of getting a body that weighs 447 pounds to jump up repeatedly while spinning a rope underneath is somewhat comical if observed from the outside.\n\nYet I was surprised how easily my morbidly obese form took to the rhythm. I made six jumps unbroken the first time. Nate adjusted the length of the rope and I was able to do an unbroken stretch of 16 jumps.\n\nThis will hardly set a world record, but it almost certainly is a personal one.\n\nJumping rope reminds me of swimming. It’s something done effortlessly as a child but somehow became exceptionally exhausting as an adult.\n\nI felt my heavy body pile-driving into the gym floor with each leap, yet I kept jumping the line as quickly and often as I could.\n\nNate included jump-ropes in our metabolic conditioning for the day. The series of exercises involved a 10-calorie row, 10 push-ups and 10 rope jumps over 18 minutes.\n\nThese metabolic conditioning routines are rough. I try to get through as many rounds as possible, but I often find myself gasping for air early in the process.\n\nThe arms always go first. By the second or third round, they might as well be those flags waving wildly in those wacky inflatable tube men on display at used car lots.\n\nThe legs hold out better, to a point. But I often feel the burn in my quadriceps earlier than I like.\n\nNate would admonish me that I am much stronger than I was when we started in January. But I stay in the moment.\n\nOne pull, one jump, one push-up. There is no past or future, only now.\n\nSomehow, in the midst of that cycle, the jump rope became the easy part. I got a rhythm fairly quickly and made it through 10 jumps unbroken three or four times.\n\nAh, but there were consequences. The first time we used the jump rope, it was a Thursday workout. Nate had just returned from a trip out east.\n\nTypically, Thursday workouts are a little lighter. The body is beat up from going hard at the beginning of the week. The Thursday workout is just to get the blood flowing.\n\nBut Nate’s assistants led me through workouts earlier that week. He did not see me grind through. So he decided to bring his own grind.\n\nThe workout ended and my legs quivered.\n\nThe next day, my knees ached as they hadn’t done since the early days of physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nI invested in a large bottle of ibuprofen, which cost almost as much as the jump rope. But hopefully the 1,600 pills will last longer.\n\nThe medicine did the trick for the inflammation. A light weekend allowed the knees to recover.\n\nBut after Monday’s workout, I texted Stefanie to ask her what muscles were hurting. I described the location of the pain.\n\nShe sent me the name of the muscle and a link to a health website to learn more about it. My trouble spots were the hip flexor and something called the quadratus lumborum.\n\nSo not only am I jumping rope like I did in middle school, I’m learning physiology through aches and pains after workouts.\n\nI took physiology from a great teacher at East High School named Paul Sloan.\n\nI don’t recall how well I did in the class, but if you’re reading, Mr. Sloan, you were right. I probably should have paid more attention.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 17, 2016\n\nNew sensation\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of anything. I’ve typed that sentence before, but I find it especially true as I evaluate the changes in my life while recovering from morbid obesity.\n\nThe latest weigh-in at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center shows a loss of 116 pounds since March 2015 and a decrease of my body mass index of more than 22 percent.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, but I am headed in the right direction — and have been nearly 18 months. My diet is better, but hardly perfect.\n\nMy exercise routines at CrossFit Merle Hay continue to grow in intensity. I probably am physically stronger now than I have been at any point in my life.\n\nStill, sometimes my brain defaults to running my body as if it were still 563 pounds.\n\nFor example, one of the reasons I began this journey was because I hurt my back carrying in groceries from the car. I carried in all my groceries at once because my body wasn’t fit enough to make two trips to the car without serious exhaustion.\n\nIn a recent workout, I set a personal record of deadlifting more than 330 pounds, under coach Nate Yoho’s guidance.\n\nYet, still, whenever I get home from the grocery store with the bags in my trunk, I think, “Oh, man, am I going to hurt my back again?”\n\nI eat well, but I do not carry 330 pounds of groceries at any point. I doubt I carry in 50 pounds of groceries.\n\nAnd the other day, as part of a circuit workout, I carried a 53-pound kettlebell in each hand on a 100-meter walk as a part of a series of exercises in metabolic conditioning. It wasn’t a strain.\n\nCarrying the groceries isn’t, either. But my mind thinks I can’t, even when my body obviously can.\n\nIt’s a strange thing.\n\nWhen I weighed 563 pounds, one of the most difficult tasks I faced six days a week was walking the 150 yards or so from my apartment building to the mailboxes in the parking lot.\n\nAt my worst, I would drive my car to the mailbox, get my mail and then park as close as I could to my door.\n\nNate and I have just begun to work on running and jumping in workouts — two activities I thought my body would never be able to handle again. I even bought a jump rope.\n\nI walked a mile the other day for time. I don’t remember the time, but it wasn’t bad, and I wasn’t out of gas.\n\nWe’re going to try a jogging and walking combo the next time we test on the mile.\n\nSo, of course I can traverse 150 yards without a problem. I just think that I can’t.\n\nSo I hesitate. I think, “Oh, that is so far.”\n\nThen I walk and think, “Why was I worried about this at all?”\n\nOne of the things my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, and I worked on early in recovery was getting in and out of the car without pain.\n\nTo this day, some 116 pounds lighter and much stronger, I often pause with my door open, dreading the idea of standing up and getting out of the car.\n\nI know I can do it without needing to use my arms to pull myself up on the frame of the door and roof of the car.\n\nBut I still think about it.\n\nI suppose this will eventually pass.\n\nI felt a little milestone recently at the gym when Van Marshall, a CrossFit trainer who was pinch-hitting for Nate while he was out of town, gave me a lengthy workout.\n\nI looked at the slate he outlined for me. It was one of those scaled workouts that decreases by one rep each session, beginning at 10 and ending at one.\n\nThe circuit involved rowing, ring rows and a weightlifting exercise. The whole thing was topped off with an 800-meter walk.\n\nI looked at that workout and thought, “Yeah, I can do that.”\n\nNow that is real progress, friends.\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 10, 2016\n\nLessons in mental health\n\nDear Natasha,\n\nYour therapist emailed me asking for a copy of a recent column I wrote about an incident in my childhood in which my mother briefly locked me in the basement and how that affected how I think about the world.\n\nYour therapist kept with the ethics of her profession. She did not tell me your name or anything specific about your case other than you, too, struggled with adverse childhood experiences.\n\nNatasha, as far as I know, is not your real name. I picked the name Natasha because there is a Natasha Romanov bobblehead figure on my desk as I type. Natasha is also known as the superhero Black Widow and is played by Scarlett Johansson in the “Avengers” movies.\n\nAll your therapist said was that you struggled as a child and were working toward ways to change how that affects you.\n\nThis is good. This is great. It is an important first step, maybe the most important one of your journey. I wanted to pass along a few things I have learned in my efforts to regain mental health and physical health.\n\nYou are not alone. It seems that way, especially in the darkness of night when there is no one to talk to and the anxiety and depression creeps in. But there are millions of us out there who live with mood disorders. Yes, we struggle. But through the struggle we learn about ourselves and the better we understand ourselves, the easier it becomes to accept who we are and become the person we want to be.\n\nIt’s going to hurt. There is no pain-free path through the suffering we’ve endured or our current challenges. Remembering the things that we survived, whatever they may be, hurts. Sometimes it hurts worse than the day it happened. But you can get past the pain and on the other side of that is understanding. I wish there was an easier way toward personal enlightenment, but there isn’t. I promise you, though, it’s worth it.\n\nClosure is a lie. The link between adult behavior and childhood experience is well-studied and scientifically proven. Still, the world is not made up of thinkers. People like snap judgments and simple answers. They will tell you to “just get over it already” or that you need to seek something called “closure.” Maybe you will even tell yourself these things. These are fantasies. “Closure” is brought up when people who are tired of talking to you about the things that hurt the most. There is no such thing as closure. The most painful moments in our lives, be it the death of a loved one or a hardship endured, are with us for the rest of our lives. We never “get over” them. We just reach a point of where we understand that pain is a part of our identity.\n\nA reason is not an excuse. As you continue on your wellness journey, you will begin to understand the links between your current behavioral issues and their roots in your past. Still, you must accept responsibility for the mistakes you make now and in the future. You may not have had an easy go of it so far. That’s true for lots of people. Everyone makes mistakes and will for the entirety of their lives. Through therapy, you’re investigating the causes of the thinking errors that lead to patterns of mistakes. But the only way we make progress is by accepting our faults with our strengths and owning the person we are as a whole.\n\nKeep moving forward. You will fail. You will still have bad days. There is no such thing as a perfect person and there’s no sense in shredding your sense of self-worth because you’re not perfect. Remember that no matter how hard life hits you, no matter how often our brain chemistry twists our thoughts into knives that cut us so deeply, we are still standing. Survival is no small feat. Don't take it for granted. There is a difference between surviving and living. And the key to that is accepting that you are deserving of love, dignity and respect. I work on that every day and haven't come to fully accept it. But I, like we all are, am a work in progress.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDaniel P. Finney, fellow traveler\n\nWEDNESDAY, AUG. 3, 2016\n\nThe gauntlet\n\nCrossFit Merle Hay owner Nate Yoho wrote the day’s workout plan on the black dry erase board in yellow marker.\n\nHe said it would be a challenge. I read the list. I thought it was attempted murder.\n\nStill, in nearly eight months working with Nate, I’ve yet to refuse one of his “challenges.” The tasks daunted me.\n\nThe first round consisted of 60 reps of squatting and tossing a 14-pound ball to hit a target on the wall, 50-calorie row and 40 reps of a weightlifting exercise.\n\nA five-minute break followed.\n\nThen came 40 swings of a 35-pound kettlebell, a 30-calorie bike ride and 20 pickups and tosses of a 40-pound ball.\n\nThen came a seven-minute rest.\n\nThe final round was 20 “thrusters,” a chore that involves squatting with weight on a bar across your back and then pushing the weight over your head, 10 jumps onto a platform and five burpies, a kind of torture that can barely be described without profanity.\n\nI was halfway through squatting and tossing the 14-pound ball against the wall when the I first thought I was never going to make it through this insanity.\n\nMy shoulders burned so bad somewhere through the first weightlifting exercise that I was glad to be bald for I would surely never be able to wash my hair again.\n\nI remember the first break. My legs and arms quivered. I could barely lift my water-filled University of Iowa Iowa women’s basketball tumbler, a recent gift from my dear friends Lisa Bluder, Jan Jensen and Jenni Fitzgerald.\n\nI thought for sure I was going to throw up each time I leaned over to pick up the kettlebell for a series of swings. I thought I might actually pass out in the humidity. My forearms were slick with sweat.\n\nMy shirt, one of those newfangled fabrics that’s supposed to wick moisture away from the body, was heavy with sweat. Apparently the designers had not consulted Nate Yoho when they made that wicking promise.\n\nI kind of enjoyed the second round of ball throwing. I picked up the sand-filled ball, hefted it to my shoulder and let it fall to the ground behind me. I repeated the process 20 times.\n\nI like throwing things on the floor. It feels like something you should get in trouble for. Yet in the gym, under the right circumstances, such activity is rewarded.\n\nI can’t remember the seven-minute break. I know I took it. I drank water. I’m sure I hurt everywhere and felt spent. But my psychologist says the brain doesn’t remember pain. It’s a good thing. If it did, I would never get out of bed.\n\nI recall Nate saying near the end of the break that I should walk around a bit to loosen up. The first task of the final round was thrusters. I botched the first three reps before Nate corrected me.\n\nAt this point, I only had so many reps of anything left in me. It was no time to start losing form. I recovered.\n\nThe jumps came easy. Somewhere Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist at Mercy South Physical Therapy, is squealing. When I first came to see her about 18 months ago, I couldn’t walk 156 feet. Now I was jumping. It was only a few inches onto a soft platform, but still — jumping.\n\nThen came the burpies. No one likes burpies. The fittest person in Nate’s gym will groan at the notion of burpies. A burpie is an exercise in which you touch your thighs and chest to the ground, hop to a standing position and then jump.\n\nExperienced athletes often jump over a weight bar. My goal is to jump enough to get my feet off the floor and clap my hands above my head.\n\nI did 30 burpies to close out a workout session earlier that week. I had “burpie burns” on both knees — red scabs from where the fabric of my shorts rubbed against my knees so much it created bloody sores.\n\nI needed to complete just five burpies to end the session. I felt like a building collapsing each time I hit the floor. But I fell five times and got up five times.\n\nThe workout ended. I survived.\n\nNate showed me the timer on his phone. I had worked out for an hour straight.\n\n“How does that feel?” Nate said as he offered me a fist bump.\n\n“Awful,” I said.\n\nThat was a lie. It felt fantastic. I mean I was spent. If he had asked me to do one more thing, I definitely would have thrown up.\n\nBut consider: I weigh about 450 pounds with arthritic knees. I made it through nine different exercises with a total of 275 repetitions.\n\nIf you’d asked me before I started if I thought I could make it through all that, I would have scoffed.\n\nYet I did.\n\n“I didn’t think I had it in me,” I said to Nate.\n\n“There’s always more left than you think there is,” he said.\n\nTUESDAY, JULY 26, 2016\n\nYesterdays matter today\n\nMorbid obesity is a medical diagnosis, but I also look at it as a symptom of my complex psychological profile.\n\nI’ve written often about the close connections between mental wellness and physical wellness, in particular the relationship of obesity to adverse childhood experiences. But I rarely write about the experiences themselves.\n\nToday, I want to share one story, a milder one, from my childhood as a way of talking about how patterns of behavior formed in my brain that continue to contribute to mental and physical health problems some 26 years after my mother died.\n\nI was a small boy. I’m not sure how old.\n\nWe lived in the baby blue house on Lynner Drive off of what was then known as Harding Road in northwest Des Moines.\n\nMy father was a traveling salesman. He was often away.\n\nMy mother could be loving and caring. But her moods were volatile. She took many medications for a variety of ailments both real and imagined.\n\nSome of the medications include opiate-derivative painkillers that now are illegal because of their highly addictive nature and side effects that include severe short-term memory loss.\n\nI didn’t know any of this at the time. What I knew was that if Mom was sleeping, it was best not to interrupt that because you never knew if you were going to get Loving Mom or Other Mom.\n\nI was so afraid of Other Mom that on more than one night, when she slept through dinnertime — which happens when you are on heavy painkillers — I crawled on my hands and knees to the kitchen and poured myself a bowl of Lucky Charms and crawled back to my room.\n\nI crawled because I didn’t want to risk waking Mom. Loving Mom would have made me toast and been apologetic.\n\nOther Mom would have been apoplectic that I was out in the kitchen dirtying dishes, and she probably would have sworn she made dinner, even if she had not.\n\nOne day, Mom slept in her room. I was looking for two comic books. I wanted to trace the art on notebook paper.\n\nOne was an issue of reprints of the Invaders, a World War II superhero team that included Captain America. The other was an issue of the Avengers, now the basis of blockbuster movies.\n\nI was fairly certain the comics were in the cream-colored bag with yellow handles that had a Joe Cool Snoopy silk-screened on the side. I kept things to do in that bag, activity books, colors and so on.\n\nWhen my parents went places, rarely were there things for children to do. I was expected to be seen and not heard.\n\nThe bag was in the basement. I was not supposed to go to the basement without permission, but I decided to risk it.\n\nI went downstairs and found the bag, but the comics were not in it. Mom appeared behind me.\n\n“WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE BASEMENT?” she asked. It was Other Mom, and I was in big trouble.\n\nI stammered an explanation. She would have none of it. The argument was brief, one-sided and loud.\n\nIt concluded with Mom saying, “WELL IF YOU LIKE IT DOWN HERE SO MUCH, YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE!”\n\nShe flipped off the light, slammed the basement door and latched the hook and chain.\n\nI tried to push the door open, but she slammed it onto my arm and I withdrew. The darkness scared me.\n\nMy feet were bare and there were sometimes creepy little water bugs on the concrete tile floor.\n\nI waited until I thought she was gone. I was a husky boy, even when I was small. I opened the door as far as the chain would allow and leaned in until the chain ripped loose of the door frame.\n\nI hustled up to my room, closed the door and nothing was said of the incident again.\n\nThe next day, Loving Mom took me to the Target down the hill to buy some “Star Wars” toys.\n\nEven typing that story today, I feel a tightness in my chest, a primal kind of fear that is hard to explain.\n\nI’ve written about schema before — behavior patterns set as children as a reaction to environmental stimuli.\n\nThere were three ways I learned as a boy to cope with the potential for Other Mom: eating sugary foods, watching TV and buying toys, comics and books.\n\nAs a child, these were effective survival strategies.\n\nBut they have led to unhealthy behaviors as an adult, some of which I have finally begun to address directly through psychoactive medication and behavioral therapy.\n\nYet whenever I feel stress — whether it be a performance evaluation at work, a cruel comment from a reader or simply an unexpected change in plans — I default to these reactions.\n\nI am a spendthrift. It is a terrible habit that I’ve learned is not uncommon among people who struggle with mood disorders.\n\nHistorians, for example, say Winston Churchill, who lived with depression, was constantly in need of money after he left the prime minister’s office.\n\nI have spent myself into bankruptcy once. I continue to struggle with overspending.\n\nSome people use the cute name “shopaholic” to describe the affliction. But this isn’t enjoying sales at Von Maur.\n\nThis is me trying to buy a sense of security and safety. My apartment looks like a combination toy, book and DVD store. And still I buy more.\n\nI should pause to note I don't blame my late mother for the mistakes I make as an adult. The authorship of those errors rests only with me.\n\nBut there is a difference between a reason and an excuse. This is an examination of the root cause.\n\nIt's the simplest and most human of all: I am insecure.\n\nMost of us are insecure to a degree. Mine is both chronic and acute.\n\nIt is strange that I chose a trade in which I would put so much of myself up for public scrutiny, but that is a column for another day.\n\nSometimes it’s hard for people to understand that things that happen to us as children affect how we feel about ourselves and act as adults.\n\nIt was a long time ago, the thinking goes. Let it go.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not the way the brain works. It takes time to build new schema and the struggle goes on.\n\nThe good news is Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who took me in after my parents died, are thrifty. They saved 4 cents of every nickel they ever earned.\n\nThey counsel me on debt management and spending. I know I frustrate them because of my struggles turning off the spending spigot. But we make progress.\n\nIt really is the same principle as working out at the gym or losing weight. One starts and moves forward.\n\nThere will be setbacks, weight gains, missed reps on the dumbbells and money spent that should have been saved.\n\nThe best I or anyone can do is get up tomorrow and try again.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2016\n\nA fitting tale\n\nMy friend Yvonne sent me a gift card to a big-and-tall men’s store for my recent birthday. She suggested I get myself something to celebrate my smaller frame after losing nearly 110 pounds since last March.\n\nI drove to West Des Moines with some trepidation. Yes, I’ve lost weight and it is both visible to myself and others but also measurable in gains in physical activity and health.\n\nBut lost weight does not always translate into a trimmer frame. The body loses weight asymmetrically. Some parts shrink quickly, others seem to desperately hang onto the fat.\n\nThen there is the problem I have described before of hanging skin. I was more than 560 pounds when I began this recovery. That extra weight stretched some of the skin in my body beyond its natural elasticity.\n\nAs I have lost weight, the skin has not shrunk to fit, so to speak. So I have great folds of flesh in my midsection that were once fully filled with fat now dangling at my beltline and below like the deflated envelope of a hot air balloon.\n\nShopping for clothes was never my favorite exercise, fat or otherwise. I have an odd predilection to either loud, brightly colored Hawaiian-style shirts or navy blue golf shirts and khaki slacks.\n\nVariety may be the spice of life, but the wrong shirt will hang in my closet for years unworn – much to the frustration of Mom 2.0, who for years try to style me up only to see me favor navy blue and khaki.\n\nThis much I will say about shopping for larger sizes for the good: 20 years ago, shopping for what was called “husky” clothes was an adventure in awful fashion.\n\nIt was as if manufacturers scoured the notebooks of the D- students at fashion design schools and told their factories to make that peach and cream stripped shirt, only really big with a pocket on the left breast and an elastic waistband at the bottom.\n\nToday, I can find clothes emblazoned with logos of my favorite sports teams, comic book characters and other pop culture ephemera. Still, I trend toward the navy blue golf shirts and khaki. There are very few places where such attire isn’t considered acceptable.\n\nDespite the expanded selection, there is always a lot of emotion tied up in trying on clothes. I’ve worked hard not to make this journey about a single number – my weight.\n\nBut almost as haunting as my weight is the size of my pants. The number on the scale can be kind of abstract after a bit, but few things terrorize the psyche as much as trying to button and zip up a pair of jeans that once fit loosely.\n\nStill, I was realistic as I selected several sizes of my current brand of khakis from the rack. All the exercise at the gym, the swimming and the diet would still count even if my pant size had not changed.\n\nI tried on a pair two sizes smaller than my current pants. I knew this wouldn’t work. This was sort of a Hail Mary. My current pants are very loose, but comfortably so. I like my pants a bit on the baggy side.\n\nI was right. Two sizes down was too far to go. I couldn’t button them. I shed them and tried the next size up.\n\nThis was the real test. Where was I at? Had my circumference at the waste shrank along with the number on the scale.\n\nI slid them on. Not a bad fit, I thought. I buttoned and zipped them with ease. These are all good signs. But there is a final test that all pants must endure before I will pay money for them: How do they sit?\n\nWhen I sit, that’s when those folds of flesh at the waist bunch up into what some inelegantly describe as a “front butt.” I took a deep breath and sat. And … fail.\n\nThe otherwise nicely fitting pants pulled taut over my belly. I looked at myself in the mirror and realized I would be uncomfortable and self-conscious, especially with the pockets filled with my keys, wallet, smartphone, pens, notebooks and sundry other items.\n\nIn the past, this sort of thing would have sent me on a spiral, feeling as if all the work had been for naught.\n\nInstead, and pleasantly so, I felt only vaguely disappointed. I know I am healthier. I also the journey is still in its early phases. My current khakis are made of sturdy material. I’ll wear them a little loose for a while longer.\n\nI spent the gift card on a T-shirt with superheroes on it and a polo shirt made of that material that wicks sweat away from the body. I even broke form with the color. It’s a pleasant dark gray.\n\nMONDAY, JULY 11, 2016\n\nDon't cheat, just eat\n\nA while back a reader stopped me in Tasty Tacos. He was a follower of Making Weight and wondered if my three taco meal was a “cheat day.”\n\nThe fellow was good-natured and lacked malice. It was, I thought, an honest question.\n\nI told the man I don’t believe in cheat days. I’m allotted a specific number of calories per day – 2,500. When I reach that number, I stop eating.\n\nThis isn’t to imply I have a perfect record on that. I go over a smidgen here and there and sometimes more than a smidgen.\n\nEstimating calories can be tricky even with the help of a quality smartphone app such as MyFitnessPal, my preferred calorie counter.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to use most of those calories up on food that is high in nutrients and low in certain fats, sugars, simple carbohydrates and chemicals.\n\nSo I could eat 2,500 calories worth of Twinkies, but I’m not going to get much nutrition out of that. And it won’t do my type 2 diabetes much good, either.\n\nThat said, I don’t go in for the “cheat day” concept. We can all make better choices about what we put into our bodies, but none of us are perfect.\n\nI would fare poorly on a diet of mostly greens, a few fruits and some meat. So, yes, sometimes an English muffin or even deep dish pizza finds its way onto my plate.\n\nI mitigate these calories by planning. For example, a buddy took me out for my birthday a few weeks ago. I wanted to go the Wig & Pen in Ankeny and indulge in their glorious deep dish pizza.\n\nWe split a large. That was four slices for me. I looked it up in advance. Those four slices amounted to 1,400 calories. We ate side salads with the meal.\n\nI still had room within my calorie goal for a glass of milk and a protein bar before bed.\n\nObviously I wouldn’t want to eat deep dish pizza every day. That would be counterproductive. But once in a while is fine, especially if I’m keeping up with my exercise schedule and making regular trips to the swimming pool.\n\nThe idea of cheat days bugs me for a couple of reasons. First, I think it encourages binging, which is a behavior that one simply must avoid to lose weight and get fit.\n\nSecondly, the “cheat” part of the concept implies you should feel guilty about the food you enjoy. That kind of thinking leads to shame and hopelessness that can lead to a shattered diet plan.\n\nI’m all stocked up on guilt and shame for this lifetime. So I’m not going to feel guilty about what I eat. What I am going to do is try to make the best choices possible within prescribed limits.\n\nFor example, Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died, host an annual July 4 bash.\n\nThe buffet table is laid out with scores of delicious goodies. Hardly any of them are on those preferred food lists.\n\nSo this year, I went with a game plan. I decided in advance which foods I really wanted and which foods I could pass on.\n\nI measured out my pork and beans, grilled turkey and pulled pork, coleslaw and pickles wrapped in chipped beef and cream cheese.\n\nI left the chips and the dip behind along with the scalloped corn and cheesy potatoes.\n\nThe toughest passes were Mom 2.0’s delicious spritz and sugar cookies.\n\nOh, I could have had one, but I saved my sweet for the once-a-year treat of homemade pineapple sherbet.\n\nI ate a small meal at the end of the day of some leftover grilled turkey and a yellow tomato. I made sure I went for a swim.\n\nIt turned out I was about 150 calories under my goal for the day. My carbs were with in prescribed levels, though my fats were higher than I would want to see on most days. I blame the cream cheese.\n\nStill, I had a lovely meal with company of good friends and family. I was able to enjoy the holiday.\n\nI believe not considering it a “cheat day” prevented me from overeating and making myself miserable both physically, by overstuffing my stomach, and mentally, by feeling guilty for how much I ate.\n\nSo if you want my advice, don’t cheat, just eat within prescribed limits.\n\nTHURSDAY, JUNE 30, 2016\n\nNumbers game\n\nI haven’t written about my weight in a while, which seems odd given these paragraphs are about my ongoing efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nWhen I started this journey, that was the only number that mattered to me.\n\nHow I felt about myself and the entire journey rested on the number that flashed on the scale.\n\nIf I lost weight, I was good. If I gained, I was bad. My mood swung violently with each pound. Anxiety rattled me in advance of weigh-ins.\n\nBut I’ve been at this a while now. I’ve come to the realization my recovery and health is not measured by the scale.\n\nThis isn’t to say I’ve gained a bunch of weight. I don’t know. I haven’t been to Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center, where I weigh in, since May.\n\nI’m not avoiding it. I’m just not that interested in the results.\n\nNo, I’m not giving up on the journey. I’m just measuring progress differently.\n\nInstead of body weight or even body composition, I’m looking at the things I can see with my own eyes.\n\nMy pants are baggy to the point of being clownish. Clothes in my closet that haven’t fit for years are comfortable again.\n\nI can even see the changes to my body. Oh, I’m still plenty lumpy. Yet skin sags where it was once filled with fat.\n\nI can feel muscles in my arms, legs, shoulders and chest.\n\nAnd there are plenty of other numbers.\n\nI can carry 35-pound kettle bells for 400 meters. A year ago, I whined when Stefanie Kirk, my physical therapist, handed me 2-pound weights.\n\nI can press 120 pounds over my shoulders.\n\nA back that once couldn’t carry in groceries without injury can now withstand deadlifts of 230 pounds for four repetitions in six sets.\n\nI can row on a machine for 500 meters in less than two minutes.\n\nI can squat to my heels without losing my balance and I can do that with 125 pounds on my back.\n\nNate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay and my fitness coach, posts my progress on a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and my doctor, Shauna Basener, can see.\n\nI can see the differences in my body, from the thickness of my belly to my balance in the videos and pictures he posts.\n\nWhen I took to the pool this spring, I started doing the exercises Stefanie gave me last year. But they were too easy.\n\nSo I just decided to swim. I swim uninterrupted for 40 minutes. I get faster and stronger each week.\n\nMy muscle mass is increasing. I know this not because of a readout on a computer, but because it is easier for me to sink to the bottom of the pool.\n\nLast year, I couldn’t dive down to touch the bottom of the pool the entire season.\n\nThis year, I do it on every dive. I try to do a handstand on the pool.\n\nI’m getting ever closer to being able to do pushups off the floor.\n\nThe other day at the gym, I fell down. I lost my balance while trying to do front squats, an exercise where I hold a weight bar at my neck and bend into a catcher’s squat.\n\nI’ve seen it happen to the other athletes at Nate’s gym. They front squat a lot more weight than me. But everybody falls down.\n\nHere’s the difference for me: I got back up again and finished the rep.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, a fall might have sidelined me for the day.\n\nI used to get calf injuries with big knots on the muscle. Nate would roll them out with a special tool.\n\nI haven’t had that problem in a long time.\n\nI feel better. I am stronger.\n\nAm I done? Heavens no.\n\nThere is so much more to do.\n\nBut I am getting better about not letting the journey be about one number.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 20, 2016\n\nJust one of the guys\n\nI looked at the red numbers on the dusty, old clock radio by my bedside. Monday morning had arrived. The workweek loomed.\n\nMy brain stalled. The chemicals that cause anxiety churned somewhere in the folded pink-gray mass inside my skull and a froth of panic bubbled.\n\nI tried to process the intense fight-or-flight response with intellect. I knew this was a chemical malfunction. There was no real reason to be this horrified by the new day.\n\nAll I needed was to swallow one of the greenish yellow pills. Fifteen minutes would pass. My heart rate would drop. I would be fine.\n\nBut I resisted. In retrospect, of course, I feel the fool. A close friend struggles with anxiety, too. She also takes prescription medication to control it.\n\nWhen the first pangs of an anxiety attack echo in her mind, I tell her to take a pill. Sometimes, she pauses. I remind her the medicine cannot work if you just think about taking it.\n\nOh, were I only so good at taking the advice I so smugly give.\n\nTime passed. I checked emails. I looked at the spate of paragraphs that needed stacking for the week. Yet the tightness in my chest remained. Anxiety gripped my heart in a clenched fist.\n\nAll I wanted in this world was to get back into bed and pull the sheets over my head. Today was too much. We’ll try again tomorrow.\n\nWhy didn’t I take the pill? I can’t explain that. Sometimes I believe I can out-think my anxiety. If I know what causes it, I can deactivate it.\n\nThis is a little bit like thinking you can disarm a bomb that’s already gone off.\n\nStill, I stubbornly hunkered down and tried to grit it out. As I said, it was foolhardy.\n\nI made breakfast, a piece of steak with some grilled tomatoes. Protein fills me up and gives me the energy I need for workouts with coach Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nI watched the clock. The time to go to the gym approached. My thinking cycled. My brain almost screamed at me: “Don’t go. Just stay home. You can’t handle this today.”\n\nThis line of thinking mixed with the usual self-deprecating thoughts that I’m a bad person, that I’m not smart enough for this job and soon the bosses will figure this out and fire me, and that I am simply unworthy of love.\n\nStill, I did not take the pill. I always think the anxiety will pass through my mind like a scattered thunderstorm. It never passes. It’s always a severe thunderstorm and sometimes it’s an EF5 tornado.\n\nI thought of Nate and the guys at the gym. I like them. I like being there the same way I liked being on sports teams as a boy. I’m there to lose weight and get fit, sure. But I have no illusions about being a competitive athlete.\n\n(Nate would argue with me on that point, but the difference of opinion really doesn’t matter. He’s helping me help myself get healthier. That’s the goal.)\n\nThe clock read 1 p.m. I was dressed for the gym. I was ready to go. But I did not want to go. The flesh was willing, but the spirit was weak.\n\nI cannot say with precision what made me decide to go instead of stay. I worry about disappointing Nate. I worry about backsliding on my physical progress. I worry about letting worry control me.\n\nMaybe I went to the gym simply because of reflex action.\n\nAgain, it doesn’t really matter. I went. There is a small victory in that.\n\nI loosened up, but anxiety still swirled in my mind. Nate laid out the goals for the day. We did some squats without weight to loosen my quads.\n\nHe told me what the workout plan was. I was breathing hard. My heart hammered. It wasn’t the workout. It was the anxiety.\n\nNate told me to take a couple minutes before we went through the combination of metabolic conditioning and strength training.\n\nI went over and sat on a box in a dark corner of the gym. My hands shook.\n\nNate spotted me. He asked if I was dizzy or just getting mentally prepared for the workout. I confessed it was a bad day for anxiety.\n\nHe asked if the workouts helped. They do. Anticipation is the worst part of anything: workouts, getting together with my girlfriend, friends or family, or practically going anywhere or doing anything.\n\nMy workout started at the same time as another client doing something far more intense. I was working out for 16 minutes. The set was three burpees — an exercise that sounds like something cute you do with babies but is far less pleasant — with two weightlifting challenges and a walk.\n\nI made it through the first round and was about halfway into the second when I realized I couldn’t control my heart rate anymore.\n\nYes, the workout was getting my heart rate up. The problem was, it was already pounding from the anxiety. I stopped. I finally took the damn pill.\n\nI went back to the workout. I did the best I could. It wasn’t a wonderful performance. But I made almost four complete cycles in the allotted time.\n\nI was disappointed. Nate thought I was upset with the workout. I wasn’t. I was angry at myself for not taking the pill hours before instead of bullheadedly enduring this anxiety.\n\nI finished with a cool-down exercise on the rowing machine. By then, the medicine mixed with the endorphins released from the workout.\n\nCalm settled in, even a bit of whimsy. Nate and a couple of his other trainers had a break before their next client.\n\nWe went out in the parking lot and played catch beside the building. We talked about absolutely nothing important. It was wonderful.\n\nAnd there I was, just one of the guys.\n\nMONDAY, JUNE 13, 2016\n\nHard rider\n\nCoach Nate Yoho divides my workouts at CrossFit Merle Hay into two segments.\n\nWe begin with a weightlifting exercise. Then we transition into met-con, or metabolic condition. This phase of the workout includes three or four activities, at least one of which is a cardio challenge mixed with more weightlifting reps.\n\nNate recently added five exercise bikes to his equipment inventory.

By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/03/04/asiana-airlines-fine-ntsb-column/6036013/", "title": "Government can learn: Column", "text": "Jim Hall and Peter Goelz\n\nDepartment of Transportation fined Asiana Airlines %24500%2C000 for failing to provide assistance to family members.\n\nFor decades%2C federal law was silent about the rights of Americans who lost loved ones in airliner crashes.\n\nThat changed when President Clinton signed the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act in October 1996.\n\nLast week, the Department of Transportation fined Asiana Airlines $500,000 for failing to live up to its responsibilities to provide assistance to family members of those affected by the airline's crash last year in San Francisco. Specifically, Asiana failed to properly establish a family assistance center and was very slow in setting up a toll-free number for family members or even contacting some family members after the crash. Some might believe this is a strange target for a federal fine, but it actually represents a sterling example of government at its best.\n\nFor decades, federal law was silent about the rights of Americans who lost loved ones in airliner crashes. This changed dramatically during the 1990s.\n\n1994 Pittsburgh crash\n\nShortly after the September 1994 crash of USAir flight 427 near Pittsburgh, which took the lives of all 132 people aboard, family members complained that personal effects of victims had been thrown into dumpsters along with aircraft wreckage, and that unidentified human remains had been unceremoniously buried in a common grave.\n\nWe saw similar problems in 1996, after the crashes of ValuJet flight 592 in the Everglades and TWA 800 near Long Island, which killed all 340 people aboard the planes. In both instances, family members met with insensitive and uncoordinated treatment by the airlines. After TWA 800, it wasn't long before angry families began holding news conferences and local politicians jumped into the fray.\n\nClearly, something needed to be done, but by whom? Airlines were in the transportation business and were not equipped to handle hundreds of grieving family members. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was in the investigation business, and coroners were overwhelmed by hundreds of deaths in an aircraft accident. Help was needed. Following a series of meetings involving the NTSB, the White House, congressional leaders, the airline industry and family members, all agreed that the NTSB, which is on the scene of crashes in quick order, should be entrusted to lead family affairs activities after major crashes.\n\nWashington works\n\nPresident Clinton signed the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act in October 1996. It required, under NTSB's supervision, that airlines set up family assistance centers near the accident site, house family members, establish toll-free phone numbers for family members and provide counseling. A year later, foreign airlines that serve the USA, such as Asiana, were given the same requirements.\n\nThe NTSB established an office of specialists in family assistance and mass casualty disciplines to help during tragic events. Family members are now briefed daily at the accident scene on the investigation's progress, and on the recovery and identification of victims.\n\nAfter investigators leave the crash site, the NTSB keeps families in the loop. This successful American model has been adopted around the world, including by the European Union.\n\nSince that time, the efforts of the NTSB and the airlines have virtually brought an end to needless chaos for families after major crashes. Last week's action against Asiana is the first time that an airline has failed to live up to its responsibilities and been fined.\n\nThe Department of Transportation deserves credit for reminding airlines of what is expected if the worst should occur.\n\nJim Hall, president of Hall & Associates, was chairman of the NTSB, where Peter Goelz, senior vice president of O'Neill and Associates, was the first director of the Office of Family Assistance.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

The voice recorder captures the pilots' voices and any other cockpit sounds for two hours.\n\nThe tail piece discovered along the African coast of Mozambique last weekend was sent to Australia, where government and industry officials will see if it matches the missing Boeing 777-200ER. It, too, may hold clues to the flight's disappearance.\n\nInvestigators are trying to piece together whether a mechanical problem or a pilot error caused the accident, giving a measure of closure to the families of the victims while also helping to avert future crashes. The 777 is a popular workhorse of long-distance flight, with 1,200 flying worldwide.\n\n“It’s absolutely vital to find this wreckage,\" said Al Diehl, a former investigator for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nSearchers using sonar have scoured the Indian Ocean floor about 1,000 miles west of Australia. The tail piece was found about 3,700 miles farther west. A flaperon from the plane was found in July between those two points on Reunion Island.\n\nBased on ocean currents, the discovery on Reunion confirmed the search focused on the right part of the Indian Ocean, according to Daniel O’Malley, spokesman for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is leading the operation. “We remain optimistic that we will find the aircraft,\" he said.\n\nSo far, searches have scanned 33,000 square miles, or about the equivalent of South Carolina, finding two shipwrecks, but no sign of the fuselage. Searchers expect to complete the remaining area about the size of Maryland in a few months.The search will ultimately cover 46,000 square miles of ocean floor. Then they plan to stop.\n\n“In the absence of credible new information that leads to the identification of a specific location of the aircraft, governments have agreed that there will be no further expansion of the search area,” the search group says with its weekly updates.\n\nDave Gallo, who helped find Air France Flight 447 at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in 2011 after a two-year search, said searchers deserve “our confidence and not sniping.” Gallo recalled the “horrible position” of doubting whether he was searching the right haystack or if the equipment would spot the missing needle.\n\n“It’s not like looking for your car keys,” said Gallo, who is now at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. “You are essentially exploring a completely unfamiliar world. There is nothing routine. You don’t know what you’re up against.\"\n\nGallo said the search should continue, perhaps with private groups taking up the challenge if the governments of Australia, Malaysia and China quit.\n\n“You can’t let this go unsettled, not in this day and age when there are thousands of planes criss-crossing the oceans with hundreds of thousands of passengers every single day,” Gallo said. “We need to know what happened.”\n\nRelatives of the missing are desperate for an explanation.\n\n“They want to know what happened to their loved ones,” said Justin Green, a lawyer with the New York firm Kreindler & Kreindler who represents 20 families. “They haven’t had funerals. They haven’t cleaned out rooms of people who were on that airplane. They want answers, and the last thing they want is for this to happen to someone else.”\n\nSome families, without certainty about the fate of the plane, cling to hope that the passengers may still be alive somewhere, said Steven Marks, a Miami lawyer at Podhurst Orseck who represents 40 families.\n\n“I think that will continue until the wreckage is found and the answers are revealed,” Marks said.\n\nThe mystery also complicates the legal recourse for the families. Under international conventions, a two-year deadline looms for filing lawsuits against Malaysia Airlines, Green said. Families will likely file cases next, even without knowing who or what is to blame.\n\nMarks said the victims' families could bring product defect cases against Boeing if all other causes for a crash could be ruled out. Other explanations include pilot error, a rogue passenger acting nefariously, a maintenance problem, air-traffic control or weather, he said.\n\nUnderwater searches 'not easy ... but not impossible'\n\n2-year delay in better flight tracking weighed\n\nThe flight, which left Kuala Lumpur at 12:42 a.m. local time, sent its last automated transmission, from a maintenance system, at 1:07 a.m. The plane’s transponder, which transmits its location, shut down at 1:21 a.m.\n\nA fire or depressurization may have incapacitated the crew, but the silence from the maintenance system and transponder raised the specter that somebody turned off the equipment intentionally.\n\nEither way, the plane continued flying for hours, according to hourly satellite clues that led like a string of bread crumbs to a remote patch of the Indian Ocean where the search is concentrated. A ground station for Inmarsat satellite communications initiated hourly attempts to reach the aircraft, the last at 8:10 a.m. The so-called handshakes are comparable to a cell phone searching for a tower to relay a potential call.\n\nThe plane made at least three turns to get to that point, according to radar and satellite tracking, so the presumption is that someone was flying the plane until at least the third turn.\n\nThe first turn was a fishhook to the west from its original northeast flight path over the Gulf of Thailand. The second was a bank to the right or northwest after crossing over Malaysian peninsula. And the last, which wasn’t captured by radar, required a turn left or south, if the satellite signals are accurate.\n\nA December report from ATSB described the theoretical end of the flight. The aircraft tried to log on to a satellite at 8:19 a.m., which suggested power had been interrupted temporarily. By then, both engine had likely shut down and the fuel was spent. Finally, the plane fell into the ocean.\n\n“This evidence is therefore inconsistent with a controlled ditching scenario,” the report said.\n\nThat is where the mystery remains. The report did not determine whether anyone was still alive at the controls — or what mechanical problems or human choices led to that spot at least 7 hours and 38 minutes after taking off.\n\nThe disappearance of MH370 prompted international calls to track planes more closely over water, which would narrow the search area after a disaster. The International Civil Aviation Organization, a branch of the United Nations that sets policies, is considering monitoring airliners every 15 minutes over oceans.\n\nBut an ICAO committee postponed the requirement for at least two years, to November 2018, because reporting a plane’s position by latitude, longitude, altitude and time posed an \"unrealistic operational burden” on airlines.\n\n\"This is going to be expensive,\" said Capt. Tim Canoll, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, a union representing 52,000 pilots. “But it’s something we need to do.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/11/19/southwest-airlines-fatal-accident-ntsb-recommendations-boeing-engine-cover-fix/4238550002/", "title": "Southwest accident: NTSB recommends changes; Boeing says fix ...", "text": "The National Transportation Safety Board says Boeing needs to make the engine covers on its 737 NGs more robust to ensure errant parts don't escape and damage the plane, as happened during a fatal Southwest Airlines accident sparked by a broken fan blade last year.\n\nBoeing says a fix, which it called a \"design enhancement,'' is in the works and will make the plane better able to withstand an \"engine fan blade out\" such as the one that occurred on Southwest Flight 1380 from New York to Dallas, spokesman Peter Pedraza said in a statement.\n\nThe statement also said the thousands of 737 NGs in service are safe because fan blade inspections on the CFM International engines ordered after the incident have \"completely mitigated'' the issue.\n\nWhen the redesign is complete, the safety board said all 737 NGs should be retrofitted and new models should come equipped with it. No timetable was provided by the NTSB, FAA or Boeing.\n\nThe recommendations on the engine cover were among seven in the NTSB's final report on Southwest Flight 1380, out Tuesday.\n\nThe NTSB's investigation into the April 2018 Southwest engine failure found that a crack in an engine fan blade caused it to break off and hit the fan cover at a critical point near some latches. The impact caused the cover to open and sent some parts into the fuselage. One part punctured a window, fatally injuring a passenger.\n\nThere was a loud bang: Hearing reveals chilling details of fatal Southwest flight\n\nEd Coleman, chair and associate professor in the department of safety science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, likened it to the hood of a car flying off because of a broken latch, sending pieces into the windshield and beyond.\n\nHe said the NTSB wants to make sure, among other things, that the latches that hold together the engine cowling are reinforced so the Southwest accident isn't repeated.\n\n\"They're looking at those latches to make sure they can withstand the impact (of a broken fan blade) and make sure it doesn't come apart,'' he said.\n\nThe NTSB's recommendations say the redesign should apply to existing planes and new 737 NGs.\n\nThere are several thousand Boeing 737 NGs in service, with Southwest alone counting more than 700. The NG, which stands for next generation, was the predecessor to the Boeing 737 Max. The latter has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes in five months.\n\nIt's not the first issue for the NG this year. Some older NGs were required to go through inspections because of a wing cracking issue.\n\nColeman said any cowling redesign will require testing and that the process could be lengthy given the scrutiny.\n\n\"It could be just because of all the hoops they are going to have to go through,'' he said.\n\nSouthwest Flight 1380, with 144 passengers and five and crew members on board, was headed from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Dallas Love Field when the emergency occurred about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nOrdinary trip turns tragic: 22 minutes of terror on Southwest Flight 1380\n\nThe left engine of the Boeing 737-700 failed because of the broken fan blade. Fragments from the fan cowl struck the fuselage and a window in row 14 was suddenly gone.\n\nThe plane quickly lost pressure, forcing passengers to use oxygen masks, and made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nThe passenger sitting next to the window in row 14, 43-year-old Jennifer Riordan of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was partially sucked out of the window before two flight attendants and a couple passengers pulled her back in. The Wells Fargo bank executive and mother of two was the first person to die in an accident on a U.S. airline in nearly 10 years. Eight passengers suffered minor injuries.\n\nSouthwest issued its own statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The safety of our fleet and the well-being of our employees and customers are paramount in importance, and we appreciate work of the NTSB and of all parties involved in determining a probable cause of the accident,'' Southwest spokesman Brad Hawkins said in the statement. \"We all have the same goals: to share facts, and learn from what happened. We look forward to reviewing the recommendations of the NTSB and continuing our ongoing work with the manufacturers to prevent a similar event from ever happening again.''\n\nAmong the NTSB's other recommendations: Southwest training needs to emphasize the importance of flight attendants being strapped into jump seats during an emergency landing so they can assist with evacuations upon landing, and the FAA needs a policy on what to do if there aren't enough seats on a flight during an emergency landing.\n\nThe issue stems from the fact that passengers in row 14 had to be moved after the incident and some were moved to the jump seat, not leaving enough seats for the flight attendants on the packed flight. The NTSB didn't criticize Southwest's actions but noted the issue has to be addressed by the airline and the FAA in this age of full flights.\n\n\"To me, that’s one of the important takeaways from this,'' Coleman said. \"If (the plane) crashes or goes off the runway, those flight attendants are no longer available to do their job.''\n\nHe admits there aren't easy answers. \"Do we put the passengers on the floor?''\n\nIn the NTSB's words: 7 recommendations in the wake of Southwest Flight 1380 fatal accident\n\nThe NTSB's formal recommendations, the first five directed at the Federal Aviation Administration:\n\n1. Require Boeing to determine the critical fan blade impact location(s) on the CFM56-7B engine fan case and redesign the fan cowl structure on all Boeing 737 next-generation series airplanes to ensure the structural integrity of the fan cowl after a fan-blade-out event.\n\n2. Once the actions requested in No. 1 are completed, require Boeing to install the redesigned fan cowl structure on new-production 737 next-generation-series airplanes.\n\n3. Once the actions requested in No. 1 are completed, require operators of Boeing 737 next-generation-series airplanes to retrofit their airplanes with the redesigned fan cowl structure.\n\n4. Expand the Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 25 and 33 certification requirements to mandate that airplane and engine manufacturers work collaboratively to (1) analyze all critical fan blade impact locations for all engine operating conditions, the resulting fan blade fragmentation, and the effects of the fan-blade-out-generated loads on the nacelle structure and (2) develop a method to ensure that the analysis findings are fully accounted for in the design of the nacelle structure and its components.\n\n5. Develop and issue guidance on ways that air carriers can mitigate hazards to passengers affected by an in-flight loss of seating capacity.\n\n6. To Southwest Airlines: Include the lessons learned from the accident involving Southwest Airlines flight 1380 in initial and recurrent flight attendant training, emphasizing the importance of being secured in a jump seat during emergency landings.\n\n7. To the European Safety Agency: Expand your certification requirements for transport-category airplanes and aircraft engines to mandate that airplane and engine manufacturers work collaboratively to (1) analyze all critical fan blade impact locations for all engine operating conditions, the resulting fan blade fragmentation, and the effects of the fan-blade-out generated loads on the nacelle structure and (2) develop a method to ensure that the analysis findings are fully accounted for in the design of the nacelle structure and its components.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/12/senators-call-faa-ground-boeing-737-max-8-immediately/3139465002/", "title": "Ground the Boeing 737 Max 8, members of Congress implore the ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Members of Congress implored the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8 following a deadly crash in Africa that prompted European authorities to suspend their flights in Europe.\n\nSenators Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called for an immediate cessation of flights until investigators can determine the cause the crash on Sunday and another in Indonesia.

Pieces of the aircraft were scattered across the lanes and gray smoke could be seen billowing from miles away.\n\nElizabeth Galarza, a Savannah resident, was on her way to Bluffton on the Talmadge Bridge when she saw the smoke. She started a Facebook Live, asking people what had happened and warned others about driving in the area. About 20 minutes later, the news started to come in.\n\nInitial Reporting:9 dead in military plane crash in Georgia\n\n“I remember it clearly,” said Galarza. “It was devastating.”\n\nThe plane was on its last flight, heading from the Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport to Arizona where it was to be decommissioned. It crashed less than two minutes after takeoff, killing all nine guardsmen onboard. All were members of the 156th Wing in Puerto Rico.\n\nNo one on the ground was injured.\n\nAlfonso Ribot of the Metropolitan Savannah Hispanic Chamber of Commerce was working on a Cinco de Mayo event in Savannah when he saw the news from local broadcast stations. When he heard that the plane was a C-130, it made him pause.\n\n“I used to fly those planes,” said Ribot, who was part of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard in the 1980s and early 2000s. “Chills went up my spine and I said ‘Oh my God. Oh my God.'”\n\nMore:9 Puerto Rico Air National Guard members killed in Port Wentworth plane crash identified\n\nHe rushed home and called his contacts in Puerto Rico to see if anyone he knew was on the flight. There was a brief moment of relief when he found out there wasn’t, but when the adrenaline wore off, the emotions started to hit.\n\n“Everything kind of stopped, you know?” Ribot said.\n\nBut not for long. As founder and president of the Hispanic Chamber, Ribot jumped into preparations for the family members of the deceased who had to fly into Savannah. Since then, the annual crash remembrance service has held a special place in his heart.\n\n2018 Memorial:Port Wentworth holds memorial service for 9 airmen killed in plane crash\n\nThis year's service was organized by the City of Port Wentworth and took place behind the city hall building, where a tree bearing nameplates of each crewmember stands as a memorial. Those killed were Maj. José R. Román Rosado, Maj. Carlos Pérez Serra, First Lt. David Albandoz, Senior Master Sgt. Jan Paravisini Ruiz, Master Sgt. Jean Audriffred Rivera, Master Sgt. Mario Braña Ortega, Senior Master Sgt. Víctor Colón, Master Sgt. Eric Circuns, and Senior Airman Roberto Espada Gali.\n\nPort Wentworth Mayor Gary Norton told attendees at the ceremony of plans to expand the space into a veterans' memorial. Designs will be discussed at next week’s council meeting.\n\n“That day...will stick in my mind forever as long as I’m alive,” said Norton.\n\nAnother tribute to the crew, a model of the C-130 plane, marks the scene of the crash along Ga. 21.\n\nGalarza, who is Mexican American, noted the crash happened during tragic times for Puerto Rico. In the fall of 2017, Hurricane Maria had devastated the island, including the 156th Airlift Wing at Muñiz Air National Guard Base. The C-130 plane that had crashed, also known as Hurricane Hunter, flew frequently between Puerto Rico and Georgia in the aftermath.\n\n“They were doing things to help people because of the hurricane, but then that happened to them,” said Galarza, “My mind couldn’t understand why this was happening.”\n\nAn investigation into the crash determined its cause as a culmination of “a faulty engine, maintenance lapses that failed to fix it, and a series of air crew mistakes before and during takeoff,” according to the Air Force Times.\n\nHowever, the probe also exposed “troubling morale, manning and resource problems with the 156th Airlift Wing, and a possible ‘culture of complacency’ that may have led maintainers to cut corners.”\n\nThe Air Force Times reported the 156th is home to some of the oldest C-130s in the Air Force and its airmen believe their wing “is an afterthought” to the Air Force.\n\nThose aircraft were taken out of service within a year of the crash and the 156th was tasked with new missions that “restore[d] the unit’s operational relevance.”\n\nCol. Pete Boone, commander at the 156th Wing of the Puerto Rico Air National Guard, called May 2, 2018 \"a day I will never forget.”\n\nAt the time, he was the vice wing commander in Savannah at the 165th Airlift Wing and was in Wisconsin when he received a call about the crash. He got on a plane and was at the scene in a matter of hours, he says.\n\nNow, in Puerto Rico, a monument memorializing the nine fallen Airmen can be seen just outside his office window.\n\n“There’s not a day that goes by that I am not reminded about how their legacy will forever live on in our history,” said Boone in a statement.\n\nThe 165th Wing in Savannah declined interviews, which is customary, but issued a statement in the name of Col. Christopher Dunlap, the wing's commander: “Our deepest sympathies remain with the families and friends of the crew members who lost their lives in the Rican 68 tragedy. On the three-year anniversary of that fateful day we recognize that they will forever be on our minds and in our hearts. Their memory will forever be engrained in our heritage and we honor their legacy. They may be gone, but they will never be forgotten.”\n\nDunlap's sentiments are shared across the Savannah community, particularly among Hispanics. Miriam Baker of the H.O.L.A. Task Force, formed by Savannah Mayor Van Johnson in 2020 to build trust and involvement with local Hispanic residents, says the crash was gut-wrenching for her as a Puerto Rican.\n\n\"To me it was impressing,\" said Baker, who also pointed out that she has several family members who are veterans, “It hurt my heart.”\n\nAs a former member of the Puerto Rican Air National Guard, Ribot hopes people can realize the impact of the incident.

He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent. His father was a local doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities. He is known for his expensive taste in fashion and has worked for banks and hedge funds, including Goldman Sachs.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak makes a statement outside No. 10 Downing Street after taking office on Tuesday, October 25.

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nSunak has also been scrutinized over the tax arrangements of his wife Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire.\n\nEarlier this year, Sunak and Murty appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List of the UK’s 250 wealthiest people – the newspaper estimated their joint net worth at £730 million ($826 million).\n\nSunak’s election on Monday marks the pinnacle of what has been a speedy rise to power. He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/14/ireland-first-openly-gay-prime-minister/665874001/", "title": "Leo Varadkar: Ireland's first gay prime minister faces criticism", "text": "Don Duncan\n\nPRI.org\n\nWhen Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, 38, took office in June, he broke several glass ceilings at once: He became the youngest ever, first gay and first nonwhite person to lead the country.\n\nVaradkar, the son of an Indian father and Irish mother, came in as the new taoiseach, the Irish word for prime minister, with a promise that he and his party would “seek to build a ‘Republic of Opportunity,’ and that is a republic in which every citizen gets a fair go and has the opportunity to succeed.”\n\nHis rise to power was greeted with praise and congratulations, particularly by the international press — which made him the poster boy of an Ireland that is rapidly emerging from a conservative past dominated by the Catholic Church. Time magazine even put him on its cover with the tagline, “An island at the center of the world.”\n\nBut three months on, that initial shimmer has started to fade. During Parliament’s summer recess, which ends next Wednesday, Varadkar spent a lot of time abroad building his and Ireland’s image, and pursuing trade opportunities.\n\n\"Where is the taoiseach?” asked Irish radio host George Hook on his daily show recently. “Well, the taoiseach is in Canada.\"\n\nHook is one of a growing number of voices calling on Varadkar to stop with the photo ops abroad and start addressing the problems at home — such as homelessness and the economy.\n\n“While he was (in Canada), the taoiseach decided to attend a gay pride march. I think he should be attending a homeless march. I think he should be attending a balanced budget march so that we would have some government,\" said Hook.\n\nAfter Parliament reconvenes next week, Varadkar and his party will face a legislative year fraught with challenges. Ireland is facing a chronic housing shortage crisis, which has triggered unprecedented homelessness figures. Endemic corruption has been exposed in the country’s police force. This year’s budget remains unbalanced. Various aspects of the public health system are drastically dysfunctional.\n\nIn the face of all these problems, the main thrust of criticism leveled against Varadkar is that after coming strongly out of the gates in June, he has simply not delivered. Instead of strong leadership, the critics say, Varadkar has merely given public relations messages and spin.\n\n“It's sort of a slicker, more accomplished version of what Trump has done in the States,” says Lorcan Nagle, a volunteer with the Abortion Rights Campaign, an advocacy group. “You sell the image rather than sell the policy.”\n\nNagle stands behind by an information table he has set up with a fellow volunteer at a busy intersection in Dublin. Since announcing that a referendum will be held next year, Varadkar has remained silent about when exactly it might happen, as well as about the possible language and scope the referendum might have. His own position on abortion remains ambiguous.\n\n“I feel like he hasn't stepped up enough,” says Lucy Bennett, a Dubliner who passes by Nagle’s stand to sign a petition and pick up some information leaflets.\n\nPart of the current frustration with Varadkar may be rooted in unrealistic expectations. Some on the left had hoped the new taoiseach, as a gay man and son of an immigrant, would usher in a progressive agenda for his center-right party, Fine Gael. But Varadkar has held fast to his conservative politics, and that’s proving to be a lesson for the left.\n\n“I think there’s an assumption that if someone is LGBT, that they are therefore going to be automatically with us on everything else,” Nagle says, “and that’s a bad assumption on the part of the left wing.”\n\nAcross town, at a candlelit vigil outside Parliament, a group chants its resentment at feeling excluded from Varadkar's Republic of Opportunity.\n\nIn front of a dimply photograph of a homeless man who had died in the streets the night before, some 50 people yell, “What do we want? Homes for the homeless! When do we want it? Now!\"\n\nFor the past two years, rents all over Ireland have risen due to a lack of housing supply. Ireland has not been building new houses in any significant number since before the 2008-2013 recession, and now that it needs to, its hands are tied. Public spending is capped as a condition of the country’s 2010 international bailout, and the private construction sector is struggling to access credit, another legacy of the recession.\n\nAll in all, the housing shortage has led to unparalled homeless numbers in the history of the state, as people are being priced out of their homes by rising rents.\n\nAlan Buckley, a homelessness activist at the gathering outside Parliament, calls the situation a national emergency that Varadkar is doing nothing about.\n\n“Jack Watson — a person — died on your watch, Leo,” says Buckley. “You keep telling us that we live in a country that keeps improving, that the economy is growing and that's a f***ing whitewash.”\n\nVaradkar's office declined an interview for this story.\n\nThe leader has said his government will build around 2,500 social houses this year after near-zero social housing output for many years. He has also vowed to increase the country’s natural disaster relief fund and to fight inefficiencies in the national health system.\n\nPromises are well and good, says analyst Johnny Fallon, but Varadkar will have to counter the growing dissent he is facing with concrete action once parliament reconvenes.\n\n“He needs to prove that he's a real heavyweight politician and thus far that has been a challenge for him,” says Fallon. “The Irish electorate have proven that they are quite forgiving and understanding of decisions that have gone wrong simply because you have tried to do something. What they are unforgiving of is the idea of doing nothing or avoiding it. They really dislike that.”\n\nDon Duncan reported from Dublin, Ireland.\n\nMORE FROM PRI.ORG:\n\nMore:Thousands are homeless after massive Mexico quake\n\nMore:For some Americans, conflict in Syria is 'Spanish Civil War of our time'\n\nMore:Barbuda needs the world's help right now", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/03/19/new-zealand-jacinda-ardern-wins-praise-handling-mosque-shootings-prime-minister/3209576002/", "title": "New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern leads grieving nation after mass ...", "text": "She has vowed to cover the funeral costs.

He may have sought notoriety but we in New Zealand will give him nothing – not even his name.\"\n\nArdern opened her speech to lawmakers in New Zealand by using the Arabic greeting \"As-salamu alaykum.\" In English, this translates as \"Peace be upon you.\"\n\nMore:No one reported New Zealand mosque shooting livestream as it happened, Facebook says\n\nHer unflinching response to the shootings has not gone unnoticed.\n\nAbdulkhaleq Abdulla, a professor of politics in the United Arab Emirates, described Ardern's reaction to the assault as \"stoic and firm.\" Sadiq Khan, London's first Muslim mayor, referred to her commitment to \"inclusivity and equality.\" The Crisis Magazine, the official publication of the NAACP, the Baltimore-based civil-rights organization, tweeted a picture of Ardern with the caption, \"Dignity. Grace. Courage.\"\n\nAfter a conversation with President Donald Trump, Ardern was asked in a press conference what Trump could do to help the situation given that, unlike her, he did not view right-wing terrorism as a growing problem.\n\nExpress \"sympathy and love for all Muslim communities,\" she replied.\n\n\"The prime minister, when she came wearing her scarf, that was big for us,\" Dalia Mohamed, who was mourning Hussein Mustafa, her daughter's father-in-law, killed alongside more than 40 people at Christchurch's central Al Noor mosque, told media in New Zealand. Ardern met with families at the mosque over the weekend.\n\nThe first funerals were held Wednesday for Khaled Mustafa, 44, and his son, 15-year-old Hamza. The youngest known victim of the attack was three-year-old Mucad Ibrahim.\n\nMore:New Zealand mosque shootings: Some rights leaders say US is exporting extremism\n\nNew Zealand's leader has since announced that the nation's gun laws will be reformed.\n\nAbout 1.5 million firearms are owned – legally and illegally – by civilians in New Zealand, according to police data tracked by GunPolicy.org, a website run in conjunction with the University of Sydney. This equates to about 30 firearms per 100 people. In the United States, the rate is approximately 120 firearms per 100 people, according to the site.\n\nAll gun owners in New Zealand must have a license, which they can get from age 16 (age 18 for semiautomatic weapons) but the weapon itself does not need to be registered with authorities, according to the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, a New Zealand lobby group. Ardern said the suspect in Friday's attacks had a license and owned five guns. The majority of firearms owners in New Zealand are farmers or hunters.\n\nAccording to GunPolicy.org, New Zealand is among a handful of countries where police officers are routinely unarmed when they are on patrol. Officers in Britain, Ireland, Norway and Iceland also carry firearms only in special circumstances.\n\nAustralia and Britain both changed their gun laws in response to mass shootings.\n\nThe Australian government overhauled its guns laws in 1996 after 35 people were murdered during a shooting spree in Tasmania. Australia banned all semiautomatic weapons and restricted certain handguns. It offered to buy back prohibited firearms.\n\nA 2016 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that Australia hadn't had a fatal mass shooting – one in which five or more people are killed – since the 1996 shooting. In the 18 years prior to the new laws, there were 13.\n\nThe turning point for Britain came in 1996 when a man used a legally owned handgun to kill 16 young children and a teacher at a school in Dunblane, Scotland. In the aftermath, all private ownership of handguns was banned.\n\nSince then, there has been one mass shooting, in 2010, in Britain.\n\nArdern is expected to provide details about New Zealand's reforms in the coming days.\n\nThis is not the first time that she has been widely feted.\n\nWhen Ardern took office in 2017 as an unmarried 37-year-old, she was not only the country's third female prime minister and the world's youngest world leader, she was also about to give birth. She became just the second woman in history to give birth while an elected head of state and the first elected leader ever to take maternity leave.\n\nArdern made history in 2018 when she brought her 3-month-old daughter to a United Nations General Assembly meeting, the first time it had been done.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer to say, 'Right, I’ll take care of her, you take care of the country,'\" Ardern's partner Clarke Gayford, a television host, told The New Yorker magazine as the pair traveled to New York for the U.N. meeting with their daughter Neve.\n\n\"I don't want to ever give the impression that I'm some kind of wonder woman,\" Ardern said around that time as interest in her intensified, adding: \"Or that women should be expected to do everything because I am. I'm not doing everything.\"\n\nStill, such is Ardern's popularity that the term \"Jacindamania\" was coined to describe her rising stature as a young female politician who, along with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and France's leader Emmanuel Macron, has been hailed as the anti-Trump for her progressive policies on immigration, education and other social issues.\n\nArdern appeared on the cover of Vogue magazine in September, and the glossy fashion magazine described her as a \"thoroughly modern\" feminist hero.\n\nWhen she was named by Time magazine in 2018 as one of the world's 100 most influential people, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, described Ardern as a \"political prodigy\" who was \"changing the game\" for women around the globe.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was Ardern who had something to say about Facebook.\n\nThe suspect in the mosque attacks sent a white supremacist manifesto to Ardern’s office just before Friday’s massacre. He also livestreamed the attack on Facebook. The social media platform said it removed 1.5 million versions of the video during the first 24 hours.\n\nArden said she had received \"some communication\" from Sandberg on the issue, but she expressed frustration that four days later, the footage remained online.\n\n\"We have been in contact with Facebook; they have given us updates on their efforts to have it removed, but as I say, it's our view that it cannot – should not – be distributed, available, able to be viewed,\" she said. \"It is horrendous and while they’ve given us those assurances, ultimately the responsibility does sit with them.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/india/rishi-sunak-india-british-ties-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "What do Indians think about Rishi Sunak's rise?

Aaron Chown/AP In pictures: UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak Prev Next\n\nTrading places\n\nTo some, Sunak’s appointment is just the latest in a series of events to highlight the contrasting fortunes of a rising India and the recent economic woes of Britain, its former colonial ruler.\n\nIn the wake of Britain’s exit from the European Union, London has repeatedly looked to its former colony for a boost; wooing it in search of a free-trade deal and granting more visas to Indian nationals than any other country.\n\nAnd now, just weeks after the United Kingdom ceded to India its title of the world’s fifth largest economy, it is former finance minister Sunak that London is turning to in the hope of repairing the economic carnage wrought by the policies of his short-lived predecessor, Liz Truss, which roiled markets and crashed the pound.\n\nGiven Britain’s actions during the colonial period – when Indians were excluded from top jobs in their own country and barred from many institutions – it’s perhaps not surprising that there might be a sense of Schadenfreude.\n\nBut experts say it would be wrong to suggest this is the only emotion in India. Many in the nation of 1.3 billion see the moment as a reason to celebrate progress in both countries, and hope Sunak can act as a bridge between India and Britain by ushering in a new era of ties.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggested as much in a tweet welcoming Sunak’s appointment.\n\n“Special Diwali wishes to the ‘living bridge’ of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership,” the Indian leader tweeted Monday.\n\nOthers see Sunak’s triumph as reflective of a growing role in British politics for people of South Asian descent.\n\n“For a long time, the question was asked whether Britain was ready for Sunak to be Prime Minister,” said Harsh V. Pant, vice president of studies and foreign policy at the New Delhi-based think thank Observer Research Foundation.\n\n“And the fact that he is indeed now, is an enormous tribute to British democracy and to the role the South Asian diaspora has played in British politics.”\n\nMoving relations forward\n\nThe relationship between Britain and India is complicated, given the history of inequality and exploitation during the colonial era.\n\n“Some people are still perplexed about why Rishi Sunak’s race matters. It matters because of the imperial context,” tweeted Sathnam Sanghera, author of “Empireland: How Imperialism Has Shaped Modern Britain”.\n\nMany Indians have not forgotten the chaos that followed the country’s independence in 1947 and its subsequent bloody partition during which between 500,000 and 2 million people were killed and an estimated 15 million uprooted.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Who is Britain's next prime minister? 03:02 - Source: CNN\n\nPant said that until relatively recently it would have been “unimaginable” for a person of Indian origin to rule Britain, but Sunak’s appointment was the latest piece of evidence that the relationship today is “much more about the 21st century than about the past. And that has allowed both to take it forward in a much more productive manner.”\n\nEconomic considerations are at the heart of this more modern relationship, with London looking increasingly to India and its $3 trillion economy for opportunities in the post-Brexit era.\n\nBritain remains one of the largest investors in India with British companies employing close to 800,000 people in the country, according to a 2017 report, and politicians in both countries hope economic ties will grow under Sunak.\n\nAmong the biggest prizes on offer is a highly anticipated free-trade agreement, aimed at more than tripling bilateral trade, from $31 billion to $100 billion by 2030.\n\nWhen then-British prime minister Boris Johnson visited India in April, the two leaders agreed to sign that deal by Diwali. That deadline has been missed but there is renewed hope an agreement can be resurrected under Sunak.\n\n“Whether Sunak will sign the deal will be an important marker,” Pant said. “And it is an important benchmark for how far India-UK relations are willing to go.”\n\nChancellor Rishi Sunak lights a candle for Diwali in Downing Street on November 12, 2020 in London. Leon Neal/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nWhat it means for Indians in India, and in the UK\n\nWhile Sunak’s face has been plastered across newspapers and televisions in India, the mood on the ground has been harder to judge. The streets of Delhi have been quiet as Indians celebrated Diwali – the most important holiday on the calendar for Hindus, who make up about 80% of the country’s population.\n\n“It is good to see someone whose family is originally from India take the top job and that too on Diwali, which is like a blessing,” said Rajesh, a chemist in the Indian capital. “But it doesn’t mean that things between India and the UK will automatically improve.”\n\nFor some, his appointment is little more than a foreign news story.\n\nA shopkeeper, Arjun, said Sunak’s appointment “didn’t make a difference” to Indians. “Yes, he is Indian but he is still from there,” he said.\n\nOthers say the significance of Sunak’s appointment is that it underlines the success of the Indian diaspora, particularly in the UK, where about 7% of the population is of South Asian origin, according to a 2011 census.\n\nBritain’s Home Secretary Suella Braverman also has Indian roots, while London mayor Sadiq Khan was born to a working-class Pakistani family.\n\nSunak’s parents came to Britain from East Africa in the 1960s. His father was a doctor while his mother ran a pharmacy in southern England – something Sunak says gave him his desire to serve the public.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The uphill economic battle facing new UK PM Rishi Sunak: Analysts weigh in 15:55 - Source: CNN\n\n“British Indian is what I tick on the census, we have a category for it. I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nWhen he took his parliamentary oath in 2019, Sunak clutched the Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. He made history a year later when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nNow he is at the pinnacle of power – and that, analysts say, is the epitome of the diaspora’s success.\n\nPant, from the Observer Research Foundation, said Sunak’s appointment symbolizes how people of South Asian descent have “cut across political parties in the UK,” adding Sunak “will shape the political trajectory” of Britain.\n\n“I think there is a certain comfort level that people of the Indian diaspora have in these democracies,” Pant said. “And that is reflective of the largest success of India globally.”", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/02/mike-pences-ireland-pride-inspired-family-not-always-reciprocated/2164818001/", "title": "Mike Pence has a deep affection for Ireland. It's not completely ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – On a trip to Ireland as a young man, Mike Pence was helping out behind the bar at a cousin’s pub in the village of Doonbeg when he boasted about his Irish heritage to a customer.\n\n“You don’t have to tell me, son,” Pence remembers the old woman responding. “You’ve got a face like the map of Ireland.”\n\nThat map is also seared into his heart.\n\nOf all the foreign trips that the heavily traveled vice president has made in nearly three years, none will be as personal as his visit to Ireland Monday and Tuesday.\n\nMichael Richard Pence was very close to Richard Michael Cawley, the Ireland-born grandfather whom he was named after.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAnd he sees the trajectory of a second-generation American landing in the White House as the embodiment of the American dream.\n\n“It’s a testament not to that grandson, but to a great nation,” Pence said in April.\n\nCharges of hypocrisy\n\nBut while many in Ireland are proud of the close connection, others are less enthused.\n\n“We’ve moved. Don’t call,” a caricature artist from Galway tweeted in response to Pence’s announcement of his trip.\n\nThat the vice president could speak so frequently and emotionally of his family’s immigration story while President Donald Trump has taken such a hard line on migrants and refugees has struck some as hypocritical.\n\nThose planning to protest his visit also want Pence to know that Ireland is not the socially conservative country it once was.\n\nWhen, in 2015, Ireland became the first nation to legalize same-sex marriage through a popular vote, Pence was becoming nationally defined as an opponent of gay rights by backing, as governor of Indiana, a law that critics said would sanction discrimination against the LGBT community for religious reasons.\n\n“If you’re serious about your Irish roots, if you think your values are grounded in some way in those roots, it’s worth considering where Ireland is now,” said Colm O’Gorman, the executive director of Amnesty International Ireland which is organizing a “disco” protest outside the Irish parliament.\n\nDuring Pence’s meetings with top officials Tuesday, they may try to tap the vice president's deep affection for their country to boost their appeals for help with Brexit-related issues and for more work visas.\n\n\"To have that affection for Ireland maintained by the vice president in the way he does is an asset for Ireland,\" said Daniel Mulhall, Ireland's ambassador to the United States. \"I know our (prime minister) will want to make him feel very welcome.\"\n\nPence is also likely to be warmly embraced in western Ireland, his ancestral home on his mother's side.\n\nSome Irish value the connection\n\n“We’re delighted that someone from our area has got so high,” said John Flanagan, chairman of Doonbeg Community Development.\n\nThe village, where Pence’s great-grandmother was born, is also home to the Trump International Golf Links & Hotel, where Pence is expected to stay.\n\nThe day after the 2016 election, the owners of Morrissey's Pub, where Pence had once pulled pints, hung a “Make America Great Again” hat outside the door. Underneath, they pinned a note that read “Gone Celebrating.”\n\nPence is expected to drop by for an in-person celebration.\n\nPence in Poland:Polish people hold deep affection for Americans, but not necessarily Trump\n\n2020 ticket:Vice President Mike Pence dismisses talk of rivalry with Nikki Haley\n\nThe Cawley family legend\n\nPence is not expected to make it to County Sligo, where Richard Michael Cawley grew up. The family's two-room home was just outside Tubercurry, a small town at the foot of the Ox Mountains.\n\n“It’s rural Ireland at its best,” said Martin Connolly, the Sligo councilor who represents the area and who attended the same school Cawley had.\n\nSome members of the Cawley family were popular local musicians, providing the dance music for “rambling houses,” the social events held at someone’s home, according to Connolly.\n\nEconomic opportunity, however, was not as easy to find as a good Irish tune.\n\nAccording to family legend, Cawley’s mother walked her son up a hill, across the street from the cottage where he and his multiple brothers and sisters grew up, and looked toward the West. She told him his future was in America.\n\nAfter arriving at Ellis Island in 1923, Cawley worked as a trolley and bus driver in Chicago where he married Irish-American Mary Maloney. The youngest of their three children, a vivacious redhead named Ann Jane who goes by Nancy, is the vice president’s mother.\n\n“She reminds me of a lot of Irish women I know,” said Mulhall, Ireland’s ambassador to the U.S. “There’s a certain liveliness about her which we consider to be quintessentially Irish.”\n\n'I love you. Let's do this':Mike Pence's daughter Charlotte announces engagement\n\nBonding with his grandfather\n\nNancy Pence Fritsch, who is accompanying her son to Ireland, has kept up a correspondence with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar after they met in 2018 at the vice president’s residence, where Varadkar gave her an Irish scarf and pin.\n\nFritsch has recounted how her third son was a late talker, not speaking until he recited the words \"You're welcome\" in Gaelic at age three. He'd learned the phrase from his grandfather, who also taught him the Irish words to \"Humpty Dumpty\" in his gentle brogue.\n\n“He said I was the only Irishman born among the four boys in our family,” Pence said in a 2017 speech to The Ireland Funds, a philanthropic organization that backs Irish-related causes around the world.\n\nPence had hoped to travel to Ireland, after college, with the person he's called “the proudest man I ever knew and the best man I ever knew.\"\n\nWhen his grandfather died months before Pence's graduation, he made the 1981 trip with his aunt and cousin instead.\n\nThe photograph he snapped of the Cawley family’s cottage on that trip hangs in the vice president’s residence, along with the Bible verse, “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”\n\nVice President Pence to graduates:Be prepared to be ridiculed for being Christian\n\nIs Mike Pence channeling Queen Esther:A new book examines this and more\n\nA product of 'legal immigration'\n\nPence often says that he was thinking of his grandfather when he raised his right hand on inauguration day and swore his oath of office. The first invitation he accepted as vice president was to speak at The Ireland Fund’s 2017 national gala, where he was given a framed copy of his family tree and a copy of the attendance records at his grandfather’s school.\n\nThe dinner was held the same day that a judge blocked the administration’s second proposed travel ban for six Muslim countries. And the group’s decision to honor Pence prompted the resignation of one regional board member, Irish writer Patricia Danaher, who called it a “stunningly craven move” given the administration’s immigration policies and “many Irish people’s long and painful experience” with immigration.\n\n\"I think what Pence is, is the worst kind of Irish American,” said Aodhán Ó Riordáin, an Irish Labour Party senator. “If he wants to come here and then talk about the Irish immigrant experience, meanwhile being a player in what’s happening in the states, well then he’s a hypocrite.”\n\nWhen Pence talks about his family’s history, he emphasizes that he’s an American “because of legal immigration.”\n\nIllegal immigration, he’s said, “tears at the fabric of society.”\n\n“We need a system that is built on merit, on opportunity for all,” he told the Latino Coalition, a small-business group, in March.\n\n'The crisis is real':Mike Pence sees 'tough stuff' and 'compassionate work' at Texas border facilities\n\nEvolution on immigration policy\n\nAs a member of Congress, Pence tried in 2006 to forge a compromise on the hotly debated immigration issue, invoking the words enshrined on the Statue of Liberty that his grandfather's ship passed in New York Harbor. But conservative groups, used to praising Pence for his policies, labeled the bill amnesty for undocumented immigrants and attacked Pence for his betrayal.\n\n\"I was taken aback by the level of invective,\" Pence told The New York Times that year. He called immigration a \"test of the character of the conservative movement in the 21st century.\"\n\nNow, he's part of an administration that has made it a top priority to deter undocumented immigrants and refugees from coming to the United States. The president has also denounced the legal practice of “chain migration,\" the derogatory term used to describe the ability of U.S. citizens and green card holders to bring their extended family into the country.\n\nWhen Pence’s grandfather entered the United States at age 20, he was joining a brother who had been able to enter because of an aunt living in Illinois, according to genealogy researcher Megan Smolenyak. Other siblings followed Richard Michael Cawley's arrival.\n\nSmoleynyak has written that the Cawley family’s path to America is “one of the tidiest set of chain migration links I’ve ever encountered.”\n\nWhile the pattern is similar, Pence's grandfather arrived before the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which replaced a quota system based on national origin with a policy based on reuniting immigrant families and attracting skilled labor.\n\nBook:Mike Pence's evolution into Trump's bootlicking `Bobblehead'\n\nMixed views on his visit\n\nDublin firefighter Dominick Gaughan says the criticisms he hears through the media of the Trump administration’s border policies have been exaggerated and he’s thrilled about Pence’s visit.\n\n“I’m over the moon,” said Gaughan, who follows Pence and his wife on social media and says he would welcome them into his own home. “Mike Pence is like a grandson of Ireland really. I’m very proud of the connection.”\n\nIrishmen with the opposite view can express that opinion at the “Disco at the Dail” event outside parliament that will include at least one large glitter ball.\n\nO’Gorman, of Amnesty International Ireland, said the event is a chance to “celebrate the people who too often are the target of this administration’s pretty hateful policies” including migrants, refugees, women and members of the LGBT community.\n\nAdam Long, advocacy and communications spokesman for the National LGBT Federation, said people in Ireland are proud of the fact that a country that was so conservative for so long has not only led the way on marriage equality but also voted overwhelmingly in 2018 to repeal a constitutional amendment that banned abortion.\n\n“He should be very cognizant of the fact that he is visiting a country that has made significant strides on social issues,” Long said.\n\nWhen Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar brought his same-sex partner to a meeting at Pence’s residence in March, Irish newspapers trumpeted the fact that he told Pence “We are all God’s children.”\n\nIt was Pence who had invited Varadkar’s partner to the breakfast, noted Mulhall, the Irish ambassador to the U.S., who doesn't expect social issues to be a topic of discussion during the visit.\n\nPride flags:Mike Pence says banning pride flags at US embassies is 'the right decision'\n\nHow Pence can help Ireland\n\nThe meeting between Pence and Varadkar is likely to focus on Brexit. Specifically, whether the United Kingdom will leave the European Union at the end of October without agreeing on withdrawal terms. That could result in a closing of the border with Northern Ireland that was essentially abolished by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. The agreement stabilized decades of violence between Irish nationalists and British loyalist paramilitaries.\n\nDuring a trip to London in August, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the United States would side with the British government if it chooses a no-deal Brexit and could make its own trade deals with Britain to help.\n\nThomas Wright, a European expert at the Brookings Institution, said the timing of Pence’s visit is a big coup for Ireland, allowing officials to emphasize that the United States should not agree to any deal with Britain that would jeopardize the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n“Generally, visits by presidents or vice presidents to Ireland aren’t very strategic. They tend to be more about heritage or symbolism or just friendship,” Wright said. “But I think this one is actually a little bit different because of the Brexit issue.”\n\nWhen Pence meets with business leaders in Dublin, they’re also likely to discuss E3 visas. Ireland wants access to the surplus of the visas that were granted to Australia after its participation in the Iraq war. The Trump administration supports the proposal, but legislation hasn’t been approved by Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, the employment opportunities for local residents have grown in Doonbeg, where Morrisey’s Pub has been turned into a high-class restaurant, said Flanagan, the local community development chairman.\n\nTrump’s golf course has boosted the economy, he said. And there’s pride in the fact that a descendant of a local family is the No. 2 to Trump – or to any president. So they’ll let their American cousins fight over Trump’s policies.\n\n“I know his politics could cause a world war, but it’s up to the people of America to be more concerned about his politics than we are,” Flanagan said. “We’re concentrating on the respect the family has for the area. We’re giving back the respect.”\n\n'Vaseline after the burn wound':How Mike Pence plays Trump's opposite with foreign leaders", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/europe/monarchy-modernizing-queen-relevant-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "How Queen Elizabeth II modernized the monarchy | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\n“I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.”\n\nThis line, delivered on Elizabeth II’s 21st birthday, defines her career like few others. Within five years, she would be Queen – and she’d go on to be the longest serving monarch in British history.\n\nThe speech was given in Cape Town on April 21, 1947 during a tour of South Africa – when it was still a British colony – and it speaks to several key themes of her reign.\n\nFirstly, Elizabeth II dedicated herself to lifelong service. This explains why she never abdicated, even as many of her younger contemporaries did. Between February 2013 and June 19, 2014, four European monarchs stepped down: Pope Benedict XVI of Vatican City; Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands; King Albert II of Belgium; and King Juan Carlos I of Spain.\n\nElizabeth, a devout Christian who rarely missed a Sunday at church, resisted the exodus because of the promise she made not just to her subjects but to God. There’s a clue to that at the end of her 21st birthday speech: “I shall not have strength to carry out this resolution alone unless you join in it with me, as I now invite you to do: I know that your support will be unfailingly given. God help me to make good my vow, and God bless all of you who are willing to share in it.”\n\nEven when her husband, Prince Philip, retired in 2017, Elizabeth continued public engagements and brought in other members of the family to accompany her as needed. Just days after Philip’s death in 2021, she resumed official duties with the appointment of new ambassadors to the UK.\n\nSecondly, in that 1947 speech, she devoted herself to the “great imperial family,” by which she meant the British empire. The UK was losing world dominance at the time. It was the year India declared independence and ousted her father, King George VI, as head of state.\n\nDozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nElizabeth came to see that as an opportunity rather than a threat. India had asked to remain part of the Commonwealth and two years later the request was granted, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting of 1949. The monarch’s role in India was redefined as “the symbol of the free association of the independent Member Nations and as such Head of the Commonwealth.”\n\nThat was a model later adopted by other newly independent states, as British rule came to an end across Africa, Asia and other regions of the world.\n\nWhen the Queen inherited the title of Head of The Commonwealth from her father, she embraced it – which is why she is often credited with the “managed decline of the empire.” She may have lost her empire, but she retained her international footprint and reinforced it by traveling more than any of her predecessors.\n\nShe visited every one of the Commonwealth nations apart from Rwanda and Cameroon and made sure she attended key Commonwealth meetings to show her support. As she got older, she cut back on international travel but called on her eldest son, Prince Charles, to represent her instead.\n\nThen-Prince Charles speaks during the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on June 24. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIn November 2021, Barbados severed its last imperial ties to Britain, removing the Queen as head of state as it marked its 55th anniversary of independence. Like others before it, the island nation has remained part of the Commonwealth.\n\nOn Saturday, Antigua and Barbuda signaled it could be the next country to go its own way, with the prime minister saying he wanted to hold a referendum to become a republic within three years.\n\nBeyond that, the republican movements in Australia and Jamaica have perhaps the most momentum, but their biggest obstacle was always the Queen herself.\n\nIn July 2017, then-Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull – a co-founder of the Australian Republican Movement – summed it up when he was granted an audience at Buckingham Palace. “Although I am a Republican, I am also an Elizabethan,” he tweeted. “It was an honour to meet Her Majesty today at Buckingham Palace.”\n\nKeeping public loyalty\n\nOver the decades, the Queen did as she promised and devoted herself to the service of the British people. This, coupled with her ability to adapt with the changing times and make sure she remained in the public eye, meant she largely kept their loyalty despite painful upheaval within the royal family.\n\nAs a result, the British republican movement gained little traction during Elizabeth’s reign except for two periods. The first was in 1992, which she herself described as her Annus Horribilis, or “terrible year.” Two of her children, Charles and Andrew, announced their separations and her daughter, Anne, got divorced. Her favored home, Windsor Castle, also went up in flames.\n\nA fire in 1992 wreaks havoc in Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Nineteen-ninety-two is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she told an audience at Guildhall in November of that year. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an ‘Annus Horribilis.’ I suspect that I am not alone in thinking it so.”\n\nHer other big low was after the death of daughter-in-law, Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. There was a backlash when people noticed the flag hadn’t been lowered over Buckingham Palace. Newspapers questioned why the Queen hadn’t returned to London from her holiday home in Scotland. She had her reasons. That flag had never been lowered even on the death of a monarch and she stayed in Scotland because she was helping to care for Diana’s children, Princes William and Harry.\n\nEventually, she returned to the capital and paid tribute to Diana in a live broadcast. She also had the flag lowered for Diana’s funeral.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nNonetheless, Elizabeth’s approval rating didn’t fully recover until the blockbuster wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton at Westminster Abbey in 2011. William was given free rein on whom he wanted to marry – and he chose a commoner. This turned the story into a fairytale and the whole world tuned in to watch.\n\nWilliam was also given free rein on whom he invited to the ceremony. He told a documentary team in 2012 how he was handed an official guest list and didn’t recognize anyone on it, so he had a word with his grandmother. “There was very much a subdued moment when I was handed a list with 777 names on, not one person I knew or Catherine knew,” he said. “I went to her and said: ‘Listen, I’ve got this list, not one person I know. What do I do?’ and she (The Queen) went: ‘Get rid of it. Start from your friends and then we’ll add those we need to in due course. It’s your day.’”\n\nThe Queen was allowing the younger generation to do things their own way and appeal to people their own age.\n\nAfter the wedding, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge – as they were then styled – were also granted considerable freedom to set up William’s own court at Kensington Palace.\n\nBut that was nothing compared to the leeway his younger brother was allowed with his wedding to Meghan Markle. Not only was she a biracial, American actress, feminist and divorcee but she wasn’t a member of the Church of England, though she was brought up an Anglican.\n\nAs important as it was for all these elements to be reflected on her big day at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, it was also important for the monarchy – and the Queen knew it. The gospel choir; the sermon from Episcopalian bishop Michael Curry; the way Meghan walked herself down the first part of the aisle: she made the royal family relevant to so many people it wasn’t relevant to before and it was a triumph all round.\n\nEveryone involved was a winner, just as they all lost when Meghan and Harry felt they couldn’t carry on in their royal roles and moved to North America two years later. They gave their reasons why in an explosive interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, accusing “the firm” of failing to support them and accusing an unnamed family member of making a racist remark about their son’s skin color.\n\nWhilst Harry was scathing in the interview about his father, he said he continued to have respect for his grandmother.\n\nAnother major challenge for the Queen in recent years was the scandal surrounding her son, Prince Andrew, and his connection to the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew stepped back from royal duties in late 2019 amid the furor.\n\nIn January 2022, the Queen stripped Andrew of his remaining military titles and charities, as well as his right to be called His Royal Highness, as her son vowed to battle on in a civil sex abuse case brought against him in the United States. The following month the prince reached a deal with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. Andrew repeatedly rejected the allegations against him.\n\nThe Queen largely avoided becoming the target of public anger over the saga, though questions remain over how her son was able to afford the undisclosed legal bill, which was expected to run into the millions.\n\nAlthough the palace would not comment on the settlement at the time, insiders believed the move would have been welcomed by the institution ahead of the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebrations later that summer.\n\nMembers of the royal family watch an RAF flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 2, 2022, as part of the Queen's platinum jubilee celebrations. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nHarnessing the power of media\n\nThe Queen’s ability to adapt was perhaps best exemplified by her unquestionably historic visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. Mary McAleese, the Irish President, described the visit as the culmination of the success of the peace process. A transient politician would never have lent the occasion the same weight.\n\nThe Queen received a standing ovation after a speech at Dublin Castle and plaudits from across the political divide. The following year, she followed up with a visit to Northern Ireland where she put aside the murder of her cousin, the Earl of Mountbatten, by the IRA in 1979, to shake hands with Martin McGuinness. He was allegedly an IRA commander at the time of Mountbatten’s death.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II shakes hands with Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, left, watched by First Minister Peter Robinson and Prince Philip at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on June 27, 2012. Paul Faith/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result: one handshake caught on camera and another footnote in history with the Queen at the center of it.\n\nElizabeth understood the power of the media from an early age, and harnessing it was to become another key theme of her reign. That speech on her 21st birthday was recorded not just for radio but also for the emerging medium of television. At her coronation in 1953, she personally requested that cameras be allowed in to Westminster Abbey to broadcast the ceremony live.\n\nPeople famously went out to buy television sets so they could watch. It was a sacrosanct moment the public had never before been able to witness; they remembered where they were and who they watched with. The Queen had inadvertently invented event television. All she wanted was for as many people as possible to feel part of it.\n\nA phrase often attributed to Elizabeth was that “you have to be seen to be believed.” She understood that it wasn’t enough to go out in public, but she had to be seen there. Television gave her a bigger audience and when color was introduced, she wore brighter shades so she would stand out.\n\nShe allowed cameras into her day-to-day engagements too, whether it was opening a hospital or attending a local event of some sort. Instead of walking past the crowds of well-wishers, she stopped and talked to them, something which was almost unheard of at the time. Those “walkabouts” would appear in the media and show her amongst the people, not hidden behind palace walls. She supported hundreds of charities and good causes so she could get out and meet even more people.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II visits the set of the long-running television series \"Coronation Street,\" on July 8, 2021 in Manchester, England.

She established a social media presence long before her children or grandchildren did. The internet presented her with another way of connecting with her public and making herself relevant to their lives. She didn’t have to say anything. She never gave an interview. She understood that she just needed to be present.\n\nThis was a woman playing the long game. Headlines came and went.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II appears on a large video screen accompanied by Bond actor Daniel Craig during the Opening Ceremony for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London.

This approach meant she retained broad public support, including in parliament, which was the one body that had the power to dethrone her.\n\nIf she had a particular talent, it was knowing when to step in and take center stage. Who can forget her “parachuting” into the London Olympics opening ceremony with James Bond?\n\nAt times of crisis, such as the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, she addressed the country in her role as “Head of the Nation” and expertly articulated the national mood and offered reassurance. She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus and she praised those who had been following government guidelines and come “together to help others.”\n\nEvoking wartime language to place the scale of the crisis in context, she added: “We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.”\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nBritain’s Conservative Party, which has weathered the resignation of two prime ministers since December 2019, cannot remain in government for another two years without calling a general election.\n\nWell, technically, they could. But that doesn’t mean they should.\n\nLaura Beers Laura Beers\n\nUnder British law, as long as a party can command a parliamentary majority, it can continue in power for up to five years before calling an election.\n\nAnd the Conservative Party, despite having suffered a series of recent by-election defeats, still maintains a working parliamentary majority of 71, meaning that Britain’s next general election could conceivably come as late as January 2025.\n\nOn Monday, Rishi Sunak, Boris Johnson’s former finance minister, won the contest to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and will become prime minister of Britain. Johnson himself had seriously considered challenging Sunak to regain the premiership, before announcing Sunday evening that he would not stand in the leadership race.\n\nSince the announcement of Liz Truss’s resignation on Thursday, Conservative MPs have been citing the letter of the law to defend the party’s seeming determination to remain in power, despite the insistence of opposition parties and even some Tories that a general election is now a moral, if not a legal, imperative.\n\nBut as any three-year-old knows, there are two meanings of “You can’t do that!” On the one hand, there is “You can’t do that because it is actually impossible.” There is also, “You can’t do that because it is unconscionable.” When one of my sons clocks the other one on the head and I shout, “You can’t do that!” both boys understand my meaning.\n\nChanging leaders twice in the course of a parliamentary term without consulting the British electorate is the political equivalent of whacking your brother just because he annoyed you. You just can’t do it and expect to get away with it. This is especially true when, as in the current political moment, there have been dramatic reversals of party policy since the previous general election.\n\nBritain is facing inflation, rising borrowing costs and predicted deficits on a massive scale which will likely require either significant tax increases, spending cuts or both.\n\nThe policy decisions taken in the next few months will have implications for years to come. There is a political imperative for Britons to be given a say as to how their leaders should tackle the current crisis. By ignoring that imperative, the Tory party would risk further eroding faith in Britain’s democratic process, at a time when democracy is under significant threat around the globe.\n\nThere is a political imperative for Britons to be given a say as to how their leaders should tackle the current crisis. Laura Beers\n\nIn the current situation, it is untenable to argue that the mandate which the public gave to Boris Johnson and the 2019 Conservative election manifesto still holds. This is true despite the fact that Sunak, the new party leader, served in Johnson’s administration.\n\nIt would have to be true even if Johnson had returned as prime minister – an incredible political reincarnation which Johnson seriously considered attempting before announcing on Sunday that he would not stand for the leadership despite the “very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative Party members.”\n\nEven before Truss announced her resignation, Britain’s opposition parties have been calling for a general election in the wake of her disastrous “mini-budget,” the series of policy U-turns that followed and her decision to sack her newly appointed chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng.\n\nFollowing Truss’s resignation announcement, Labour leader Keir Starmer reiterated those calls, emphasizing that the British people had a right to weigh in on the question of who should lead the country.\n\n“The Tories cannot respond to their latest shambles by yet again simply clicking their fingers and shuffling the people at the top without the consent of the British people. They do not have a mandate to put the country through yet another experiment; Britain is not their personal fiefdom to run how they wish,” Starmer said.\n\nLikewise Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, asserted that there was now a “democratic imperative” to hold a general election, and the Liberal Party leader Ed Davey, insisted that the Conservatives had a “patriotic duty” to “give the people a say” about the future direction of the country.\n\nThat Britain’s opposition parties are clamoring for an election is unsurprising. The latest opinion polling shows Labour up over 30 points on the Tories, the party’s largest poll lead in history. If an election were called in the next few months, Labour would almost certainly win a comfortable majority.\n\nBut the conviction that “the British public deserve a proper say on the country’s future,” extends beyond the opposition ranks. A YouGov poll conducted Thursday found that nearly two-thirds of Britons believed that Truss’s replacement should call an early general election.\n\nIn asserting the imperative for an early general election after two changes of leadership, the opposition parties have history on their side. British political parties have frequently made a single change of prime minister without calling an early election.\n\nGordon Brown replaced Tony Blair in June 2007 and did not hold an election for nearly three years. John Major replaced Margaret Thatcher in November 1990 and did not call an election for another year and a half. Similar to Brown, Jim Callaghan, who succeeded Harold Wilson, lasted nearly three years without an election.\n\nBut in each of these cases, the men who took over had been long-serving and high-ranking members of their predecessors’ administrations, and (with the exception of Major’s abandonment of the highly unpopular poll tax) largely continued the policy program on which their predecessor had been elected.\n\nIn that sense, their ascension to the premiership was more akin to the elevation of a vice president after the death of a president in the United States – a significant change in government, but one accepted to be within the bounds of democratic legitimacy.\n\nIn contrast, the only prime minister in the modern era to govern without seeking a new electoral mandate after two changes in leadership was Winston Churchill, whose wartime coalition government had the united support of all parties in the House of Commons and the clear backing of the British public.\n\nBefore Churchill, we need to look back to 1828, when the Duke of Wellington succeeded the Viscount Goderich, who in turn had succeeded George Canning (who died in office after 119 days and who held the title of shortest serving prime minister for nearly two hundred years, until Liz Truss came along.)\n\nFollow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe Tory Wellington remained in office for a year and a half without calling a general election. But Britain in 1828 was not a true democracy. Fewer than 10% of adult males could vote, and several MPs represented “rotten boroughs” which were effectively controlled by a handful of wealthy families. The notion of democratic accountability simply did not exist in the way that it does now.\n\nToday, in the 21st century, with universal adult suffrage, Starmer is right that the Tories cannot treat Britain as their personal fiefdom. After all that has happened since Johnson’s resignation in July, they must seek a fresh mandate to remain in power.\n\nAfter all the chaos and dysfunction, the British people deserve a say over who governs the country.", "authors": ["Laura Beers"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/politics/american-presidents-queen-elizabeth-ii/index.html", "title": "'One of my favorite people': What Queen Elizabeth II meant to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Princess Elizabeth landed at Washington National Airport on the last day of October 1951, she emerged from her airplane in a raspberry red coat, a new velvet-brimmed hat and, some people observed, more makeup than usual.\n\nIt was her first official visit to the United States, three months before she would become Queen.

Meanwhile, the Queen spoke about her previous visits to the White House and the history of diplomatic relations between the two countries. Bush said during his welcome address: \"We have got a lot of things in common. Americans share the Queen's love for horses. ... Most of all what links our countries is less a place than an idea.

I think in the imagination of people throughout America, I think what the Queen stands for and her decency and her civility, what she represents, that's very important.\" Later, during a reception for G-20 leaders, Michelle Obama was seen to take the unusual step of putting her hand briefly on the back of the Queen.

The monarch had to do an awkward sidestep around him. Matt Dunham/AFP/Getty Images Joe Biden: Biden first met the Queen as a young senator in 1982. He returned nearly 40 years later, after his first G7 summit as President. They held private talks inside Windsor Castle, and Biden later said he wished he could have spoken to her longer. \"She was very generous,\" Biden said. He said he did not think she'd be insulted if he said she \"reminded me of my mother in terms of the look of her and the generosity.\" Chris Jackson/Getty Images All the Queen's presidents: From Truman to Biden Prev Next\n\nIt was the first time Elizabeth would encounter a sitting American president. Over her reign, she would meet 12 more, each man paying a degree of homage to the duty-bound woman whose very life charted a century of history.\n\nPerhaps no other person had met personally with so many American leaders or had witnessed at close range the upheavals of war, technology and politics that have defined the “special relationship” between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nRemoved from the politics of transatlantic relations, yet still at the very center of British identity, the Queen provided American presidents a connection to their predecessors, a reminder of what a life devoted to public service looks like and a bit of uniquely royal glitz.\n\nMany emerged enchanted, spellbound or starstruck.\n\n“Whenever anyone becomes acquainted with you,” Truman told Elizabeth that day in 1951, “they immediately fall in love.”\n\nIt was a sentiment that would be repeated, in so many words, for the next 70 years, as American leaders visited her at her palaces in the United Kingdom or when she traveled to the White House.\n\n“She is truly one of my favorite people,” then-President Barack Obama said during a visit to London in 2016, after the Queen and her husband drove in their Land Rover to pick him up at Windsor Castle. “She’s an astonishing person, and a real jewel to the world and not just to the United Kingdom.”\n\nSome presidents, like Ronald Reagan, bonded with the Queen over horses and country life. Others, like Bill Clinton, found themselves impressed by her political aptitude.\n\nIn recent years, as she aged, presidents saw in her their own pasts. President Donald Trump said after meeting her, his Scottish-born mother would be proud. When he visited the Queen at Windsor last year, President Joe Biden said she reminded him of his own mother.\n\nQueen Elizabeth’s first state visit to Washington came in 1957, hosted by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, at an important moment for the new sovereign to represent her country with its most important ally.\n\nYet even Eisenhower, the commanding general of US forces in Europe during World War II, found himself humbled in the presence of the Queen.\n\n“There have been a few times in my life when I have wished that the gift of eloquence might have been conferred upon me,” he said during his toast at the state dinner. “This evening is one of those times.”\n\nAs it turned out, the Queen had a penchant for bringing out the relaxed side of the American leaders she encountered. After inviting Eisenhower to Balmoral, her estate in the Scottish Highlands where she died on Thursday, the Queen promised to provide him her recipe for scones. She followed up in a letter several months later.\n\n“Dear Mr. President,” she wrote in her scrawling, distinct hand. “Seeing a picture of you in today’s newspaper, standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail, reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe of the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral.”\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy arrived in London for a state visit in 1961, he and his glamorous wife Jacqueline were met with crowds of Britons lining the streets. The dinner was described as “pleasant,” though later there were rumors of tensions between the Queen and first lady over the guest list.\n\nKennedy, who was assassinated two years later, did not meet the Queen again. But when Britain dedicated a memorial to Kennedy in Surrey, around 20 miles outside London, the Queen paid tribute alongside Mrs. Kennedy and the slain President’s children.\n\nShe never met President Lyndon B. Johnson as his presidency became consumed by the war in Vietnam; he remained the only president she did not meet during her reign.\n\nThe Queen had already met Richard Nixon when he was serving as vice president, but met him again as president in 1969, when he paid a visit to the United Kingdom. Later, when the Queen’s children – Prince Charles and Princess Anne – visited the Nixon White House, observers thought the President seemed unusually interested, hiring bands and arranging a special ceremony.\n\nThere was even a hint of potential romance – though it didn’t pan out.\n\n“That was the time when they were trying to marry me off to Tricia Nixon,” Charles recounted in an interview with CNN in 2021.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford was serving in office as the United States marked the 200th anniversary of American independence, a bicentennial that also marked its severance from Britain. Perhaps in a show of enduring US-UK ties, Ford hosted the Queen for a state dinner underneath a tent in the Rose Garden.\n\nIn a yellow chiffon gown and diamond tiara, the Queen was whisked around the dance floor by the President.\n\n“The Queen was easy to deal with,” then-first lady Betty Ford recounted in her memoir. “She was very definite about what she wanted and what she didn’t want. She loves Bob Hope and Telly Savalas, so we invited Bob Hope and Telly Savalas.”\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter had a somewhat more mortifying experience during his visit to Buckingham Palace in 1977: He kissed the Queen Mother on her lips.\n\n“Nobody has done that since my husband died,” she exclaimed. Her husband, King George VI, died in 1952.\n\nNo president appeared more comfortable with the Queen than Ronald Reagan, who became the first American leader to spend the night at Windsor Castle in 1982. A shared love of horses – she the English rider; he the Western cowboy (at least in movies) – seemed to cement their relationship.\n\n“I must admit, the Queen is quite an accomplished horsewoman,” Reagan wrote in his memoir. He invited her the following year to his Rancho Del Cielo property in California, initially making plans for her to sail into Santa Barbara harbor on the royal yacht.\n\nA severe storm scuttled the maritime plans, forcing the Queen to arrive by airplane. At the ranch, Reagan wore a jean jacket and bolo tie to serve her and her husband a Tex-Mex lunch: enchiladas, chiles rellenos, refried beans, tacos, rice and guacamole.\n\nTheir friendship would stretch beyond Reagan’s presidency. In 1989, she granted Reagan honorary knighthood to recognize the US assistance during the Falkland Wars.\n\nWhen she came to Washington a few years later, President George H.W. Bush brought her to a Baltimore Orioles game and hosted her at the White House – where she ended up encountering another, future president.\n\nSpeaking with George W. Bush in 1991 about the new pair of boots he was wearing for her visit, the younger Bush revealed they’d been stamped with the words “God save the Queen.” That prompted her to ask if he was the black sheep of the family.\n\n“I guess so,” he acknowledged.\n\n“All families have them,” she replied.\n\nDuring President Bill Clinton’s presidency, he met with the Queen during a tour of her palace and at the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. But during a visit to London in 1997, he and his wife Hillary turned down the Queen’s invitation to tea, preferring instead to “be a tourist,” according to documents released by the UK’s National Archives last year.\n\n“The Americans said that the President and Mrs. Clinton were very grateful for HM The Queen’s invitation to tea at the Palace, but would wish to decline politely,” a note from Blair’s private secretary, Phillip Barton, revealed.\n\nStill, Clinton was impressed by the Queen’s unique abilities.\n\n“Her Majesty impressed me as someone who but for the circumstance of her birth, might have become a successful politician or diplomat. As it was, she had to be both, without quite seeming to be either,” he wrote in his memoir.\n\nMore than a decade after their chance initial meeting in his father’s White House, George W. Bush meet the queen several times, including when he became the first US president to be received with a state visit to Britain in 2003.\n\nHe would host Queen Elizabeth’s final visit to the White House in 2007; it was a symbolic nod to her first State Visit as queen 50 years earlier and marked the 400th anniversary of the English settlement of Jamestown, Virginia.\n\nDuring his welcoming remarks, he inadvertently suggested the Queen had also visited the White House in 1776 – adding 200 years to her age.\n\n“She gave me a look that only a mother could give a child,” he said after winking in the monarch’s direction.\n\nThe aging queen would not return to the White House again but continued receiving American presidents in Britain. When Obama and his wife arrived in London in 2009, they came bearing an iPod loaded with footage of her previous visits to Washington, along with recordings of some of Obama’s speeches.\n\nEtiquette hawks were aghast when Michelle Obama placed her hand on the Queen, but the Queen herself did not seem to care. Speaking with aides after a dinner at Buckingham Palace, Obama remarked she reminded him of his own grandmother.\n\n“She’s just like Toot, my grandmother. Courteous. Straightforward. All about what she thinks. She doesn’t suffer fools,” he said, according to a memoir by one of his aides.\n\nHis two predecessors also felt pangs of maternal memory when they encountered the queen in the final years of her life.\n\n“I was walking up and I was saying (to wife Melania): ‘Can you imagine my mother seeing this scene? Windsor. Windsor Castle,’” Donald Trump told an interviewer afterward.\n\nTrump’s mother, born on the Outer Hebrides islands of Scotland, was enraptured by the Queen; Trump recalled her watching Elizabeth’s coronation on television. While his own visit to Windsor had awkward moments, like when he walked in front of the Queen as they were reviewing an honor guard, the Queen herself evinced no displeasure.\n\nWhen Biden visited the United Kingdom for a Group of 7 summit in 2021, the Queen made a surprise decision to travel to the Cornish coast to meet world leaders, a signal of her desire to remain engaged in global affairs.\n\nWhen she hosted Biden later at Windsor Castle, she asked him about two authoritarian leaders, Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Vladimir Putin of Russia.\n\nUnlike Trump or Obama, Biden is not an Anglophile. He’s a proud Irish American who has – sometimes jokingly – made references to the long British rule over his ancestors’ island.\n\nLast year also wasn’t his first time meeting the Queen; as a young senator, he’d received advice from his mother – an Irish American born with the surname Finnegan – ahead of a planned engagement with the monarch.\n\n“Don’t you bow down to her,” she told him in 1982, according to a memoir Biden published several years ago.\n\nWhen he met her last year, he did not bow. But he did remark on a familiar resemblance.\n\n“I don’t think she’ll be insulted,” he said, “but she reminded me of my mother.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/16/europe/france-female-prime-minister-intl/index.html", "title": "Elisabeth Borne: France names first female Prime Minister in 30 ...", "text": "Paris CNN —\n\nElisabeth Borne has been named the new Prime Minister of France, the first time in 30 years that a woman has held the position.\n\nBorne will replace Jean Castex in the role, the Elysée Palace said in a statement on Monday, becoming only the second woman ever to serve as Prime Minister since the end of WWII.

That’s because tide gauges measure sea level relative to the land, which is also rising in Australia.\n\nThe loss of ice from polar continental regions, increasing atmospheric pressure and other water changes around the globe \"result in the Australian continent rising slightly,\" said John Church, a professor emeritus of science at the University of New South Wales who co-authored a study on Australian sea levels.\n\nFact check: Tide gauge data, not photos, prove sea level rise at Statue of Liberty\n\nClimate change is accelerating the rate at which the global sea level is rising, according to experts. That acceleration is due to the global warming-induced melting of ice sheets and glaciers, as well as the physical expansion of warming seawater.\n\nPhotos cannot show the status of sea-level rise because of tidal fluctuations\n\nIt is “virtually impossible” to use photos to determine if there have been any changes to the sea level in Sydney Harbor, or in any location for that matter, according to experts.\n\nThe two photos in the meme only include information about the year they were taken. No information is provided about the tidal stage or time of day for either picture.\n\n“Sydney Harbour has a tidal range of up to 2 meters,” depending on the time of day, Jane Gardner, communications director at the Climate Council told USA TODAY. “The picture would obviously look different depending on the height of the tide when the picture was taken.”\n\nUSA TODAY has debunked similar claims in the past that attempt to cast doubt on sea-level rise using old photos of prominent landmarks.\n\nOur rating: False\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that photos prove the sea level hasn't risen in Sydney Harbor. Experts say photos cannot be used to accurately ascertain sea-level change over time. And, sea levels in Sydney Harbor are indeed rising, according to tide gauge data and experts.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Well, those days seem gone.\n\nThis year's U.S. News and World Report's Best Places to Live in 2023-2024 ranks Austin at No. 40, however, the city is still the top place to live in Texas.\n\nIn the last few years, the city has been slipping from the top of this list. Austin sat at No. 1 from 2017 to 2019, then went down to No. 3 in 2020 and dropped to No. 5 in 2021.

According to the report, the median home value in the city was $504, 273, compared with a national average of $365,616. However, the report seems to be using the same home values that it did last year with prices from 2021.\n\nAccording to the Austin Board of Realtors, the median home price in the city was $565,000 in April, an 11.4% decrease from last year.\n\nMore:4 key takeaways, expert analysis and median home prices for Austin-area houses in April\n\nAdditionally, the report states that the average rent in the city was $1,398, while the average salary is $60,260.\n\nAustin commute time slightly over national average\n\nSomething else Austin lost out on that's probably not too surprising: its commute time. With an average commute of 27.5 minutes, it's just slightly over the national average by 0.7 minutes.\n\nThat likely won't improve any time soon. Especially with the future of Project Connect, the multibillion-dollar voter-approved public transit overhaul, now up in the air as the Legislature considers a bill that could make Austinites vote on it again after the price tag went from $7.1 billion to $11.6 billion as of April 2022 due to rising costs and inflation.

Heaps of debt, bruising competition from Amazon and crushing pressures to reduce their physical footprint forced a wave of closures, some after companies filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe 2010s were cruel. Retailers shed thousands of stores in 2017, too, another record year of losses in the past decade.\n\nMichael Brown, a partner in the retail practice of consulting firm A.T.

We had Borders and Barnes & Noble, we lost Borders,” Brown said. “We’ve seen a narrowing of the big box sector based on the strength of growing online but also on the growing strength of Walmart and Target being able to service those categories for the consumer.”\n\nA decade of store closings\n\nHere's a look at some of the biggest stores that shuttered all or nearly all locations in the 2010s, many of which relaunched an online presence.\n\nBebe: 180 stores\n\nWomen's clothing chain Bebe was part of the 2017 string of closings and closed all of its stores that May.

In 2010, the company filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Dish Network in 2011, which planned to keep most of the 1,700 remaining stores it bought open. By the end of 2014, all corporate stores closed but a few franchise stores stuck it out. After two of the last three U.S. locations in Alaska closed in 2018 and the last store in Australia closed in March 2019, there's only one remaining location of the iconic franchise left worldwide in Bend, Oregon.\n\nBorders: 399 stores\n\nKmart owned the bookstore chain in the early 1990s before spinning it off into a separate company. At one time, the book retailer operated more than 1,000 stores but lost business with the rise of e-readers like Amazon's Kindle and the growth of discount retailers. In 2011, the chain filed for bankruptcy protection and announced some stores would close but then ended up closing its remaining 399 stores. Borders also operated Waldenbooks, which it also shuttered.\n\nCharlotte Russe: 510 stores\n\nThe San Diego-based mall chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early February 2019 and outlined plans to close 94 stores. After not finding a buyer for the remaining stores, the fast-fashion retailer announced in March it would liquidate its 500 stores. Toronto-based clothing manufacturer YM Inc. purchased the Charlotte Russe brand and intellectual property in late March and less than two weeks after the final stores closed, the new owner promoted a comeback. As of Dec. 27, there are 139 new stores, according to the Charlotte Russe website.\n\nDressbarn: 649 stores\n\nAscena Retail Group announced the \"wind-down\" of its Dressbarn stores in May 2019 and closed the last remaining Dressbarn bricks-and-mortar stores closed Dec. 26. New Jersey-based Ascena's other brands include Ann Taylor, Ann Taylor Loft, Lane Bryant, Catherines and the Justice tween brand and it sold the intellectual property assets of Dressbarn to a subsidiary of Retail Ecommerce Ventures LLC. The brand's new owner plans to launch a new Dressbarn website in early 2020.\n\nFred's: 568 stores\n\nDiscount merchandise retailer and pharmacy chain Fred's filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September 2019 after a series of closings throughout the year. Before the closures, Fred's had 568 stores in 15 states in the southeastern U.S. The fate of Fred's had been shrouded in uncertainty since the company's plans to profit from a mega-merger between pharmacy giants Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid collapsed in late June 2017 amid federal antitrust concerns.\n\nGymboree: 749 stores\n\nThe children’s clothing retailer was the first victim of 2019 when it announced in January 2019 that it filed for bankruptcy protection and would close both Gymboree and Crazy 8 stores and sell its high-end children’s fashion line Janie and Jack, which had 139 stores. The Children's Place purchased the rights to the Gymboree and Crazy 8 brands for $76 million and is relaunching a new Gymboree.com and a collection in select Children's Place stores in spring 2020. The Gap acquired Janie and Jack for $35 million.\n\nHHGregg: 220 stores\n\nElectronics and appliance retailer HHGregg filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2017 and had initially planed to close 88 stores in 15 states. It ended up closing all of its 220 stores in 19 states. Today HHGregg exists as an online store.\n\nThe Limited: 250 stores\n\nThe Limited was one of the first retailers to announce mass store closings in 2017 and closed its 250 stores that January. It was formerly a part of L Brands, owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Today The Limited is available exclusively at Belk.\n\nPayless ShoeSource: 2,589 stores\n\nThe shoe dropped for the Topeka, Kansas-based discount shoe retailer in February 2019 when it announced plans to close its nearly 2,600 stores in the U.S. and Canada and then filed for bankruptcy protection. While all North American locations closed by the end of June, Payless lives on in the U.S. through Amazon, which is selling some of its well-known shoe brands. There also are 750 brick-and-mortar stores in 35 other countries.\n\nSports Authority: 460 stores\n\nThe sporting goods store chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2016 with initial plans to close about 140 stores. After attempting to restructure debt and not finding any buyers in an auction, all 460 stores shuttered in the summer of 2016. Dick's Sporting Goods bought Sports Authority's intellectual property and some leases for $15 million.\n\nToys R Us: More than 800 stores\n\nSeventeen months after Toys R Us shuttered its last U.S. stores in June 2018, the iconic toy brand’s comeback continued in late November when the new parent company Tru Kids Brands opened its first retail Toys R Us store at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, followed by a second store in Houston, Texas in December. “These stores are fundamentally different from the Toys R Us stores that you’ll remember from the past,” Tru Kids Brands CEO Richard Barry told USA TODAY in October. “They are smaller, very immersive, experimental as well.” The new company also opened two “toy wonderlands” called Toys R Us Adventure in Chicago and Atlanta this year and rolled out a new e-commerce website and partnership with Target.\n\nWet Seal: 511 stores\n\nTeen retailer Wet Seal filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2017 and closed its remaining 171 stores after closing two-thirds of its stores in 2015, the first time the company filed for bankruptcy.

The clerk’s office announced the scheduled execution date of Miller, who was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in the slayings, which occurred in Shelby County in 1999. Testimony indicated Miller was delusional and believed the two men he killed were spreading rumors about him, including one that he was gay. Although a defense psychiatrist testified Miller was mentally ill, he also said Miller’s condition wasn’t bad enough to use as a basis for an insanity defense under state law. Another Alabama inmate already is set for execution later this month. A federal judge last week ruled the execution of Joe Nathan James Jr. could go ahead as scheduled on July 28, refusing the condemned man’s request for a postponement. James was convicted of killing his former girlfriend, Faith Hall, in Birmingham, almost three decades ago.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials ended their search for a woman whose 2-year-old grandchild was found alone last week in a locked car stuck in mud on a rural road, authorities said. No clues to the whereabouts of Mary Dawn Wilson, 69, have emerged since her Ford Focus was found last Thursday with the child and personal items believed to belong to Wilson, the Alaska Department of Public Safety said in a statement Saturday. Authorities believe the child was alone in the car for two days. The search was changed from “active” to “reactive,” meaning that a search could be launched again if officials receive new information or evidence, the statement said. The statement added that at “this time, there is no evidence of foul play associated with Wilson’s disappearance.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Thunderstorms packing wind gusts of up to 80 mph knocked down some power lines in the Mesa area and destroyed a mobile home, sending a woman to a hospital by ambulance. Maryjane Garcia Stanley told Phoenix radio station KTAR that her 61-year-old mother was trapped under debris after the monsoon hit Sunday night, with her legs pinned under a stove. Stanley said her mother was being treated for a broken vertebrae. Video from the scene showed the mobile home reduced to piles of rubble with debris scattered across the property and roadway. Thousands of homes reported electrical outages and State Route 87 was closed in both directions near Mesa because of fallen power lines that authorities say might take several days to repair. National Weather Service meteorologists said north Mesa received almost 1 ½ inches of rain from the thunderstorms as the Phoenix metro area continues to have an active monsoon season.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former Little Rock police chief who fired his gun at an armed suspect on New Year’s Eve won’t face charges in the shooting. Prosecutor Larry Jegley said in a letter to Arkansas State Police dated Friday that Keith Humphrey was justified in the use of force in the shooting outside a convenience store. A state police spokesman said the letter formally closes the agency’s investigation into the shooting. Humphrey had stopped after seeing a fight among a crowd in the parking lot and was approaching the group when a 29-year-old woman shot and critically wounded a 22-year-old woman, state police said. Humphrey then opened fire, but did not strike the 29-year-old, who was later arrested, state police said. The woman has pleaded not guilty to first-degree battery. Humphrey had been briefly placed on administrative leave after the shooting.Humphrey, who was hired as chief in April 2019, retired in May.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: An Oakland man was arrested for allegedly reporting a false bomb threat over the weekend, prompting the evacuation of hundreds of people from the San Francisco International Airport’s international terminal, police said. Terry Addison, 53, was charged with reporting a false bomb threat and malicious report of a false bomb threat, the San Francisco Police Department said in a statement. Addison was booked into jail in San Mateo County, where the airport is located. It was not immediately known if Addison has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. San Mateo County prosecutors did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The bomb threat was reported Friday night, and authorities said they discovered a suspicious package. Investigators at the airport “deemed the item possibly incendiary.” Police said Friday that a man had been taken into custody, but released no other information. Police said they removed “several suspicious packages” from the international terminal and that it was safe and clear to enter just after midnight Saturday.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The Larimer County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the cause of a fire in Red Feather Lakes that damaged multiple structures Sunday. Initial reports indicated the fire started about 5 p.m. in a shed on Lone Pine Court and spread to a cabin on the same property, spokesperson David Moore said. From there, the fire spread to a cabin on the next property over and caught the grass on fire. The fire burned the surrounding grass about 100 feet out from the cabins, but moisture on the grass from recent rain helped prevent the fire from spreading more quickly, Moore said. No one was injured in the fire, according to the sheriff’s office. Moore said the sheriff’s office sent an investigator to the scene Monday to investigate the cause of the fire.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Waterbury police have largely stopped using vans to transport prisoners in response to a man becoming paralyzed in a New Haven police van last month. Waterbury Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo and Mayor Neil O’Leary directed the city’s two police vans be used only for bringing prisoners to and from court until seat belts are installed and officers are trained how to use them, the Republican-American newspaper reported Sunday. The directive took effect July 1, and the seat belt installation and training are expected to be completed by the end of the summer. In New Haven, Richard “Randy” Cox was seriously injured in the back of a police van with no seat belts June 19 when, police said, the officer driving the vehicle braked suddenly to avoid an accident. Cox, who was handcuffed, flew headfirst into the metal divider between the driver’s cab and the back and became paralyzed. Cox’s family and the state NAACP are calling for federal civil rights charges against New Haven police.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A man was arrested Monday and charged with arson and other offenses in a Target store fire that police said he started “as a diversion to steal a cart full of merchandise.” The 26-year-old man started the fire in the linen section of the store on July 10 and the store was quickly evacuated, Dover police said in a news release. No injuries were reported, but $3 million to $4 million in merchandise was damaged by smoke or fire, police said. Target spokesperson Brian Harper-Tibaldo said the store will remain closed for several weeks for repairs and restocking, The News Journal reported. The Dover man was arrested at home and charged with first-degree arson, 19 counts of first-degree reckless endangering, criminal mischief of $5,000 or greater, shoplifting under $1,500 and wearing a disguise during the commission of a felony, police said. He was committed to Sussex Correctional Institution on $137,000 cash bond.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents along the 1900 block of C Street NE and D Street NE said they are concerned about flooding and are hoping the DC Department of Transportation will do something to fix the problem, WUSA-TV reported.

Dorothy Wright who said she has lived along the 1900 Block of C Street NE for 20 years and she believes the problem is a result of this construction project steps away from her front door. “I just saw water streaming down the street like I’ve never seen before,” Wright said about the rain Saturday afternoon.\n\nFlorida\n\nPensacola: The U.S. Navy’s Blue Angels have named Lt. Amanda Lee, of Mounds View, Minnesota, the first woman as a demonstration pilot for the 2023 air show season. Women have served with the Blue Angels in other capacities for more than 55 years, but Lee is the first to join the iconic flight squadron as a pilot, the Navy said. Lee, a member of the “Gladiators” of Strike Fighter Squadron 106, graduated from Old Dominion University in 2013, the Blue Angels said Monday in a Facebook post announcing the new team. The Blue Angels also named five other new members of the team based at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, including pilots Navy Lt. Cmdr. Thomas Zimmerman, of Baltimore and Marine Corps Capt. Samuel Petko of Osceola, Indiana. Lt. Cmdr. Brian Vaught, of Englewood, Colorado, was named events coordinator. Lt. Cmdr. Greg Jones, of Cary, North Carolina, will be an aviation maintenance officer and Lt. Philippe Warren, of Williamsburg, Virginia, is the new flight surgeon. The new team members will report to the squadron in September for a two-month turnover period. Once the 2022 show season concludes in November, they will embark on a rigorous five-month training program at NAS Pensacola and Naval Air Facility El Centro, Calif.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Michael Boggs was sworn in Monday as chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court. He replaces David Nahmias, who announced in February he was stepping down from the court. Georgia chief justices are chosen by their colleagues to serve a single four-year term leading the state’s judicial branch. The chief justice speaks for the high court and the rest of the state’s judiciary and presides over oral arguments and deliberation meetings. The chief justice also chairs the Georgia Judicial Council, which makes policy for the judicial branch. Georgia Supreme Court justices run for six-year terms and can be reelected. Justice Nels Peterson was sworn in Monday as the court’s presiding justice. Typically, the presiding justice is next in line to be chief justice.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Towering waves on Hawaii’s south shores crashed into homes and businesses, spilled across highways and upended weddings over the weekend. The large waves – some more than 20 feet high – came from a combination of a strong south swell that peaked Saturday night, particularly high tides and rising sea levels associated with climate change, the National Weather Service said Monday. A wedding Saturday night in Kailua-Kona was interrupted when a set of large waves swamped the event, sending tables and chairs crashing toward guests.\n\nIdaho\n\nTwin Falls: The Idaho Republican Party has rejected adding language to their platform to allow an abortion to save the life of the mother. KMVT-TV reported a majority of the roughly 700 delegates from across the state rejected the change to the party’s existing platform during its three-day convention that ended Saturday. The platform does not have the force of law but states the party’s position it wants Republicans in elected office to follow. Delegates also chose U.S. Rep. Dorothy Moon to replace more moderate Tom Luna as the party’s chair. Moon ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary in May for secretary of state, contending the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent and Joe Biden wasn’t president.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield:Gov. JB Pritzker has tested positive for the coronavirus. The governor’s press team sent out a release Tuesday morning which said the governor tested positive after being notified of several close contacts. “I’ve tested positive for COVID-19 and am experiencing mild symptoms,” the governor said on Twitter. Pritzker will work from home until he is feeling better. The governor is fully vaccinated and double-boosted, according to his press office. Last week, the governor signed an updated executive order that amends testing requirements for some unvaccinated health care employees and removes mandates for some other industries, including schools.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state sales tax on gasoline will rise slightly starting Aug. 1 even though pump prices have dropped more than 11% from a month ago. A total of 62.4 cents per gallon in state taxes will be charged during August, the Indiana Department of Revenue announced Monday. That will be up three-tenths of a cent from July’s record-high rate based on the agency’s calculations of statewide average gasoline prices over the past month – despite AAA reporting Indiana’s average price dropping to $4.58 a gallon as of Monday from $5.15 a month earlier. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and GOP legislative leaders have rejected calls from Democrats since March to temporarily suspend state gas taxes to aid residents amid the high national inflation rate. Holcomb, instead, has asked legislators to approve $225 payments from the growing state budget surplus to all taxpayers during a special legislative session that starts next week.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A former lottery computer technician convicted in a scheme to rig computers to win jackpots for himself, friends and family has been paroled after serving more than five years in prison. Eddie Tipton, 59, was released from prison Friday, according to online prisoner records. Tipton pleaded guilty to ongoing criminal conduct in 2017 and was ordered to pay restitution of $2.2 million to Colorado, Wisconsin, Kansas and Oklahoma. He shared some of the restitution obligation with his brother in Texas, who collected some of the winnings and served a 75-day jail sentence. It’s not known what happened to the money Tipton and his associates won between 2005 and 2011. Out of the seven known winning tickets that netted more than $2.2 million, Eddie Tipton claimed to have ended up with only $351,000.\n\nKansas\n\nSouth Hutchinson: A small fire in a vacant store under remodel in a strip mall led to the evacuation Monday of several other businesses in the center. The fire was discovered on the back of the building at 507 N. Main St. just after 10:30 a.m., said South Hutchinson Fire Chief Shae Barajas-Brooks. South Hutchinson dispatched two trucks and called for assistance from Hutchinson for one truck as backup because of the size of the building, which contains six storefronts, including a Dollar General, local pharmacy and liquor store. The local fire units knocked the fire down while Hutchinson firefighters helped open the roof to vent smoke. Also assisting were the South Hutchinson Police and Hutchinson Police departments and the Reno County Sheriff’s Office, who blocked streets so lines could be laid and evacuated the other buildings. The Fire Marshal was investigating the cause, but preliminary investigation indicated it was an accidental electrical fire.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The Kentucky State Fair is hiring workers for next month’s festival in Louisville. News outlets reported the fair is hiring workers for dozens of roles including admission, traffic control, guest services, operations, maintenance, outdoor cleanup and housekeeping. Morning, day, evening and overnight shifts that include indoor and outdoor work are available, the fair said in a news release. The fair runs from Aug. 18 through Aug. 28 at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville. Hiring will take place through Aug. 28. Pay ranges from $11 to $13.50 an hour, and can be $16 to $20.25 during overtime. Those who apply must be at least 18 years old and have a photo identification and social security card. Those interested can apply on the fair’s website and by calling the fair’s human resources department. Applicants can also visit the exposition center for hiring from Wednesday through Friday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBridge City: Another group of six youths has escaped from a suburban New Orleans juvenile detention center that was rocked by a June riot. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office said the six broke out of the Bridge City Center for Youth about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Five were recaptured after stealing a vehicle. A sixth youth, a 17-year-old from Orleans Parish, is still on the loose. It’s the fourth escape this year from the facility. Jefferson Parish officials are pushing to close it after a June riot in which 20 juveniles took over parts of the complex. No one escaped during the uprising, but nearby residents said they feel unsafe.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A judge has granted class-action status for an American Civil Liberties Union of Maine lawsuit over the system that provides attorneys to those who can’t afford them. The lawsuit contended there’s a failure to train, supervise and adequately fund a system to ensure the constitutional right to effective counsel. It originally named five defendants. The ruling by Kennebec County Superior Justice Michaela Murphy late last week means it’ll become a class-action suit with plaintiffs numbering in the thousands in the state. Maine is the only state in the nation without a public defender’s office for people who cannot afford to hire an attorney. Instead, the state relies on private attorneys who are reimbursed by the state and the number of lawyers willing to take court-appointed cases has declined in recent years.\n\nMaryland\n\nPiney Point: Searchers found the body of a 10-year-old girl who disappeared while swimming in southern Maryland over the weekend, authorities said Monday. Genesi Elizabeth Sosa-Bonilla was found dead near where she was last seen in the water on Sunday, the St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release. The sheriff’s office, Maryland Department of Natural Resources and members of volunteer fire and rescue companies responded to Camp Merryelande in Piney Point about 1 p.m. Sunday for a report of swimmers in distress, the sheriff’s office said. Two 10-year-olds and a man were swimming when the current pulled them farther out into the Potomac River. The man was able to swim to shore and people nearby were able to rescue one of the two children from the water, the sheriff’s office said. The U.S. Coast Coast and agencies from Maryland and Virginia were involved in the search that continued overnight into Monday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Lawmakers approved a $52.7 billion state budget Monday, more than two weeks into the state’s new fiscal year. The unanimous votes in both chambers came after a six-member House and Senate conference committee finished hammering out the details of the final compromise budget plan over the weekend. The agreement was crafted after each chamber approved their own versions of the spending plan earlier in the year. The budget – which now heads to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker for his signature – does not include any new broad-based taxes.\n\nMichigan\n\nGreenville: The FBI on Monday raided a western Michigan company that manufactures aluminum alloy wheels for automotive giants Ford, General Motors, Stellantis, Honda, Toyota and Nissan. According to FBI spokesperson Mara Schneider, the FBI executed a search warrant at Dicastal North America in Greenville on Monday morning. She provided no other details, beyond saying the investigation is ongoing, though the Detroit Free Press has learned from a source familiar with the raid that computers were seized and employees were sent home.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMorris: Local leaders in this western Minnesota city have voted to disband the police department, which has dwindled to just two officers, including the chief. The city of Morris, like other communities across the country, is dealing with changing attitudes about policing and challenges in recruiting and retaining officers. Morris, with a population of about 5,200 residents, has budgeted for eight full-time officers and an administrative specialist. The Morris City Council plans to sign a contract for law enforcement services with the Stevens County Sheriff’s Office and shut down a police department that has been around for more than 140 years.\n\nMississippi\n\nPass Christian: A lawsuit alleges that a Mississippi high school soccer player with a rare skin disease was bullied and physically assaulted for months, with school officials failing to respond. The parents of the 15-year-old boy have sued the Pass Christian school district, a principal and Jones College in Ellisville, seeking unspecified damages, saying all three failed to protect their son. The Sun Herald reported the lawsuit said the student has Darier disease, which can cause wart-like blemishes to flare up on skin that is contaminated or irritated. The parents said soccer teammates would rub muscle pain ointment or bleach on their son’s socks, or drag his clothes through the dirt, mostly during practice or before games in the 2020-21 school year. The assaults intensified when the team attended soccer camp in June 2021 at Jones College, a community college in Ellisville, the suit alleged. There, it claimed players stripped off the boy’s clothes, poured hot liquids on the boy’s face, or shoved a canned sausage in his throat, and that the players showed videos of the assaults on social media.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Charles: Police said a convenience store customer shot and killed an armed robber in a St. Louis suburb early Saturday. The QuikTrip customer, who St. Charles police identified only as a 26-year-old man from St. Louis, grabbed a gun from his vehicle and confronted the robber after he saw the man grab the clerk and hold a knife to her throat, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police said investigators believed the suspect was also responsible for a burglary and second robbery at two other gas stations that happened shortly before he went to the QuikTrip about 3:20 a.m. Saturday. He was also driving a black Toyota Highlander that had been reported stolen on Friday. St. Charles police said the suspect who died was 26-year-old Lance Bush of St. Louis who was homeless. But they wouldn’t identify the customer who shot him until prosecutors review the incident to determine if the killing was justified.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A California woman who was fatally mauled by a grizzly bear in western Montana last summer was the victim of a rare predatory attack by a food-conditioned bear that was likely attracted to food in and near her tent and scents left behind from recent Independence Day picnics, wildlife officials said. Leah Davis Lokan, 65, of Chico was pulled out of her tent and mauled in the predawn hours of July 6, 2021, in the small town of Ovando, along the banks of the Blackfoot River, made famous by the movie “A River Runs Through It.” The town borders a huge expanse of forested land that is home to an estimated 1,000 grizzlies. About an hour before the mauling, the bear had approached the tents of Lokan and a Texas couple who were camping behind a museum. They were able to scare the bear away. Lokan, a retired nurse, told the couple that the bear “huffed at my head,” according to the incident report by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s Board of Review. Lokan declined an offer to go sleep at a hotel where her sister and their friend were staying, investigators reported. The women were participating in a long-anticipated bike ride along the Great Divide Mountain route. The bear that mauled Lokan was shot thee days later while raiding a chicken coop near Ovando. DNA tests confirmed it was the same grizzly that also raided a different chicken coop in the hours after the mauling. The bear was 4 to 7 years old, investigators said.\n\nNebraska\n\nTorrington: The body of a missing kayaker was recovered early Monday from the North Platte River, authorities said, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. The victim’s identity has not been released, except a report that it is a 48-year-old woman.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Incumbent Democrats have raised more than their Republican opponents in every statewide race, according to the latest expense reports. The reports, filed Friday, document fundraising and spending from April 1 to June 30. In the governor’s race, incumbent Steve Sisolak raised almost $3.3 million, and Republican opponent Joe Lombardo raised $1.65 million. Yet, Lombardo outspent Sisolak during the quarter by just over $2 million.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCarroll: New Hampshire’s latest historical marker commemorates clergyman Henry Ward Beecher’s open-air sermon site from the 1870s near a glacial boulder in the White Mountains area. Beecher, an abolitionist, proponent of women’s suffrage, and brother to author Harriet Beecher Stowe, came to the area to escape seasonal allergies, according to the marker installed near the intersection of Routes 3 and 302 in a part of Carroll known as Twin Mountain. “While a guest at the Twin Mountain House, located near this site, Beecher conducted sermons that sometimes drew crowds over 1,000,” the marker said. The marker was unveiled earlier this month as part of Carroll’s 250th anniversary celebration. It is the 274th marker in New Hampshire’s Historical Highway Marker program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nClifton: A former silk mill and textile manufacturing building that dates to the Industrial Revolution will be demolished to make room for a residential building if city zoning officials approve the proposal. The owners of International Veiling Corp. are seeking zoning board approval to raze the three-story red brick building with large metal multipaned windows and replace it with modern apartments. The Wiley family has led International Veiling for three generations, guiding the textile company since 1904. The company, a mill for the spinning of broadcloth and ribbons, was set up in the Hazel Street building that dates to the early 1880s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nBreadsprings: Efforts continue on building a museum in Tsé Bonito that honors the Diné men who used the Navajo language to transmit secret military messages during World War II. Although there have been some studies done on the land that will hold the museum, the project needs money, presenters told New Mexico lawmakers on the Indian Affairs Committee during a July 11 meeting at the Bááháálí Chapter house. With four code talkers still alive, it is urgent to have the museum built and operating, said Regan Hawthorne, chief executive officer of the Navajo Code Talkers Museum Inc. His father, Roy, was part of the elite group that numbered about 400. The elder Hawthorne died in April 2018. Approximately 300 acres has been designated for the structure near the Navajo Division of Transportation complex and its cost is estimated at $46.6 million.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Street repairs were underway Tuesday after a van fell into a giant sinkhole in the Bronx. A sinkhole the length of three cars opened on Radcliff Avenue in the Morris Park neighborhood after heavy rain Monday. Videos that aired on local news stations showed a white van tip over on its left side and then plunge into the hole. The van’s owner told reporters at the scene that he wasn’t worried. “I’m all right,” he said. “Lose the van … it’s life.” The sinkhole was being filled on Tuesday and the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was investigating the cause of the roadway collapse, department spokesperson Edward Timbers said. Meanwhile, the van was hoisted out of the hole and set upright; the owner got in and drove it off, Timbers said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHolden Beach: A shore-based shark fishing tournament has been rescheduled after coastal officials expressed concerns about the event’s impact on tourism. Event organizer Marty Wright said fishermen could fish for sharks from Ocean Isle Beach to Oak Island, and that participants would only be using baitfish dropped from kayaks about 300 to 600 feet offshore, WWAY reported. The event was scheduled for last weekend, but it was moved to October after Wright said he received a call from Oak Island’s mayor asking him to move the event to after Labor Day, when there are fewer swimmers at the beach.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Animal health officials are ending a ban on poultry events that was instituted when cases of bird flu were on the rise. However, the decision by the State Board of Animal Health came too late for State Fair poultry exhibits this year. The board in March canceled all shows, public sales and exhibitions of poultry within the state at the request of the North Dakota Turkey Federation to help stem the spread of the bird flu. Private sales, catalog sales and retail sales were still allowed. Early last month, the board extended the ban indefinitely. But, now that summer weather and bird migration has decreased the risk of avian influenza, the board has lifted the ban. But State Fair organizers said they don’t have enough time to arrange for poultry shows this year. The fair begins Friday in Minot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A conservative podcaster who has embraced former President Donald Trump’s claims the 2020 election was stolen will be on the November ballot for Ohio secretary of state. Terpsehore Tore Maras gathered more than the required 5,000 signatures to get on the ballot as an independent, Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose said. Maras will face LaRose and Democratic nominee Chelsea Clark in November for the job of overseeing Ohio’s elections. She initially sought to challenge LaRose in the May Republican primary, but could not make that ballot.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The City Council established a human rights commission Tuesday for the first time since 1996. The nine-member commission will be charged with investigating and addressing complaints about employment, housing and public accommodations discrimination. The City Council approved forming the commission by 5-4 vote, with councilmembers Bradley Carter, Barbara Young, David Greenwell and Mark Stonecipher voting against. The previous human rights commission was disbanded by the City Council in 1996 after commissioners sought to extend protection to the city’s LGBTQ+ residents.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A judge has sentenced a 27-year-old man to at least 50 years in prison for the murder of his grandparents. Nicholas Borden-Cortez was sentenced last week in Lane County for two counts of first-degree murder, The Register-Guard reported. Borden-Cortez pleaded guilty in June to the May 6, 2021, murder of 85-year-old Nancy Loucks-Morris and 87-year-old Gerald Morris. As part of his guilty plea, prosecutors dropped two charges of second-degree abuse of a corpse and a charge of attempting to elude a police officer, as well as a separate but related case with two charges of unlawful firearm use. Investigators found his grandparents dead inside a home in the Falconwood Mobile Home Park, police said. Later that day, police named Borden-Cortez as a suspect. Borden-Cortez was arrested on May 7, 2021, in Springfield after a vehicle chase. Police said he initially challenged officers to shoot him before he was taken into custody. Borden-Cortez will be eligible for parole after serving a minimum 50 years of his sentence.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The first of six people charged with setting fire to police vehicles in Philadelphia during the 2020 protests after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police has been sentenced. Ayoub Tabri, 25, was sentenced Monday to 364 days behind bars – less time than he has already served in custody, and short enough to avoid triggering deportation proceedings for the Moroccan immigrant. Attorneys for Tabri, of Arlington, Va., said the green card holder has been in the U.S. since he was 6. A longer sentence, which he and the others faced under the original arson charges that carried a minimum sentence of seven years in prison, could have sent him to a country where he knew no one and didn’t speak the language, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain had vowed to pursue the harsher arson charges against the six people arrested. After he left office last year, federal prosecutors worked out plea deals with a handful of those defendants, including Tabri and Lore-Elizabeth Blumenthal. Still, prosecutors argued for a longer sentence in court Monday. Tabri pleaded guilty in March to one count of obstructing law enforcement during civil disorder, according to court records. Once released, Tabri will serve three years probation and have to pay about $87,000 in restitution for the Pennsylvania State Police car destroyed after he and others threw lit road flares into the vehicle.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: Two on-ramps in East Providence that connect to westbound Route 195, just before the Washington Bridge, will be closed for four days starting July 28, as the state moves the ramps to free up land. The ramps onto Route 195 west, from Veterans Memorial Parkway and Warren Avenue, will be closed starting at 8 p.m. July 28, through 6 a.m. Aug. 1, Department of Transportation Spokesman Charles St. Martin wrote in a news release. Traffic from the two ramps merge before being directed onto Route 195. The ramps need to be moved slightly to the south so work can begin on a new off-ramp onto Waterfront Drive, part of the larger $78 million Washington Bridge project, which lasts until 2026. That exit is expected to open in two years and allow for easier access to the East Providence waterfront and the east side of Providence, St. Martin wrote.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: City Councilwoman Meghan Smith has been named to a short list of prospective candidates for lieutenant governor by Democratic gubernatorial nominee Joe Cunningham. Smith is among nine people on Cunningham’s short list. Reached Monday, Smith said she is “very humbled and honored.” The others on the short list include: Tally Parham Casey, CEO of Wyche Law Firm, and first female fighter pilot in the South Carolina Air National Guard; Rosalyn Glenn, financial planner and former Democratic nominee for state treasurer; state Rep. Jermaine Johnson, a small business owner and former professional basketball player; state Rep. Kimberly O. Johnson, assistant director of the F. E. DuBose Career Center; Ed Sutton, and Air Force pilot and commercial realtor; state Rep. Spencer Wetmore, a former prosecutor and former city administrator for Folly Beach; Kathryn Whitaker, chief marketing officer of Burr & Forman, LLP; and Teresa Wilson, city manager for the city of Columbia.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: The National Weather Service said it has issued 561 severe thunderstorm warnings in the state as of July 5. That’s 131 more than in 2007, when the previous record for that time frame was set. “But you know, this is just the first half of the season, so you got to kind of take that into account comparing that to the previous seasons,” said Ryan Vipond, NWS meteorologist in Aberdeen. Although there does appear to be an increasing trend in the number of severe thunderstorms, the National Weather Service said it’s important to note the way storms are predicted has become more precise and the standards have changed over time, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reported. State climatologist Laura Edwards said it’s too early to say what’s causing the increase in storms this year.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Officials are conducting a census to learn more about the economic impact and demographics of the equine industry in the state. The University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture and the state Department of Agriculture are handling the project. Data will be used to assist with future state programs, support and resources for the equine industry, the institute said in a news release. Anyone who owns or leases a horse or other member of the horse family or who is involved with the industry can participate. Local barns, farriers, veterinarians, trainers, coaches, feed and forage producers, equine service providers and others involved in the industry are included, the release said. To complete the survey, go online to UTHorse.com and look for the Tennessee Equine Census logo. The census will continue through Aug. 15. Participants must be over the age of 18 and live in the U.S.\n\nTexas\n\nGraford: A wildfire has burned at least five homes and resulted in about 300 homes being evacuated around a lake in north Texas amid sweltering temperatures and dry conditions, authorities said. The residents returned home Tuesday, according to Texas A&M Forest Service spokesperson Adam Turner. The fire at Possum Kingdom Lake about 95 miles west of Dallas began Monday afternoon, has burned about 500 acres and was 10% contained Tuesday, Turner said. No injuries have been reported and the cause was under investigation, but it isn’t believed to have been intentionally set, Turner said. Turner has said drought conditions in the region have left the area ripe for fire. The National Weather Service has issued a Red Flag fire warning for the area for Tuesday, in addition to an excessive heat warning with high temperatures near 110 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man pleaded guilty Tuesday to fatally shooting his mother and three siblings when he was a teenager in 2020. Colin “CJ” Haynie, 19, killed his his mother and one of his sisters as they returned from her school pickup, then waited for two more siblings to arrive home and killed them, prosecutors said. His father came back to the home later that night and was shot in the leg but survived after wrestling the gun away from his son. After the father subdued him, the then 16-year-old said he had planned to kill everyone in his family at their home in the small town of Grantsville, near Salt Lake City, authorities said. Authorities have said they don’t know his motive. CJ Haynie pleaded guilty to four counts of aggravated murder and one count of attempted murder on Tuesday. Several other weapons charges were dismissed in the plea agreement, court documents showed. He had been charged as an adult by prosecutors because of the seriousness of the crime. The family’s oldest child, Danny, was not home at the time of the shootings. At a funeral for the family members in 2020 at their local Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ congregation, Danny said CJ was still loved and part of the family. Sentencing is scheduled for Dec. 7. Aggravated murder in Utah typically carries the possibility of the death penalty, but state prosecutors cannot seek it for people convicted of crimes that happened when they were under 18, even if their their cases are moved to adult court. So Haynie faces a prison sentence of 25 years to life for each aggravated murder conviction under state law.\n\nVermont\n\nNewbury: Fire has gutted an historic schoolhouse in Wells River. Firefighters from Vermont and New Hampshire said the flames were in the roof when they responded within minutes of the call on Monday, WCAX-TV reported. Three hours later, flames were visible in the steeple of the old grade school. The 1870s building is on the the National Register of Historic Places but hasn’t been used as a school since the 1970s. It has had various commercial and residential uses since then.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Archaeologists began excavating three suspected graves at the original site of one of the nation’s oldest Black churches on Monday, commencing a monthslong effort to learn who was buried there and how they lived. The First Baptist Church was formed in 1776 by free and enslaved Black people in Williamsburg, the colonial capital of Virginia. Members initially met secretly in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating. A total of 41 apparent burial plots have been identified. Most are 4 to 6 feet long and up to 2 feet wide. The soil is discolored in places where holes were likely dug and filled back in. Only one grave appears to be marked, with an upside-down empty wine bottle. Before excavations began Monday, a private blessing was held. First Baptist’s original church was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. The second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century. That building was bought in 1956 and razed to build a parking lot for Colonial Williamsburg, a living history museum that was expanding at the time and that now has more than 400 structures.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: As midterm voting kicks into high gear, Republican activists in Washington are organizing surveillance of ballot drop boxes, generating complaints and concern from some elections officials. Signs were posted near ballot boxes in several Seattle-area locations over the weekend. They had red letters warning the boxes are “Under Surveillance” and stating that accepting money “for harvesting or depositing ballots” might violate federal law, the Seattle Times reported. A scannable code on the signs pointed to a section of the King County Republican Party website with a form encouraging people to submit “election incident” reports, including photos and video. Although it is legal for people to observe the county’s 76 ballot boxes, which are located on public property, the signs raised concerns about possible intimidation. King County Elections has notified the County Prosecutor’s Office “to check on the legality” of the effort.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClendenin: Three shop students and their teacher from Herbert Hoover High School in Clendenin are working this summer to build furniture for the new Intermediate Court of Appeals courtrooms. The school won the bid to produce benches, podiums and tabletops for the main courtroom in Charleston and five satellite courtrooms. The satellite courtrooms in Grant, Lewis, Morgan, Raleigh and Wetzel counties will allow parties to virtually argue cases.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Wildlife officials said they don’t know when they will release their new wolf management plan after initially saying the document would come out this spring. The Department of Natural Resources’ wolf management plan dates to 1999 and calls for capping the statewide population at 350 animals. Wolf hunt supporters have repeated cited that number as justification for higher quotas. The DNR’s latest population estimates, compiled over the winter of 2020-21, put the number of wolves roaming the state at 1,126. DNR officials began working a stakeholder committee last year to draft a new plan. The department’s timeline called for releasing the draft for public review in the spring of 2022. The department has yet to put out anything and DNR spokeswoman Sarah Hoye said she didn’t have a release date.

According to the recent U.S. census, Utah was the fastest-growing state in the nation between 2010 and 2020, increasing its population at a blisteringly fast rate of 18.4%. And in its southwest corner, Washington County, with its stunning vistas, National Park access, recreation opportunities and warm, sunny climate led the state in that trend, attracting nearly 50,000 new residents over the last decade, a 36% increase over its 2010 population.\n\nThose 50,000 new people are just the beginning of a growth pattern projected by the Gardner Institute to flood Washington County with 321,000 additional residents over the next 45 years, to reach a local population of 509,000 by 2065. That number of people — 80% of the current population of Las Vegas — will require a lot of water in this desert landscape, more than is locally available at our current rate of use.\n\nA Growing Dilemma\n\nIn 2019, Washington County locals used, on average, 159 gallons of water per person per day from the domestic public supply (indoor and outdoor home use). This is according to the most recent calculation by the Washington County Water Conservancy District (WCWCD), the entity charged with securing the region’s future water access. This number is hotly disputed, however, with St. George City’s own Water Services Director recently quoting a daily per person water use average of 241 gallons and other sources calculating per capita use at 248 gallons per day across Utah and as high as 325 daily gallons for residents of arid Washington County.\n\nWater use across a community is notoriously difficult to measure and compare due to different methods of metering and accounting for reabsorption. But nationwide estimates using data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey suggest the average American uses only 88 gallons of water per day at home, half of the most conservative calculation for Washington County residents.\n\nThe Water Tap:What a St. George water tank project reveals about local priorities\n\nWhatever the specific reality, Utah — the second driest state — has long been criticized for having among the highest rates of water use in the country. Despite the WCWCD recently celebrating a 30% reduction in per capita water waste since 2000, conservationists say the state could do much more.\n\nA bit of math shows why this may be beneficial.\n\nEven at the lowest estimate of 159 gallons of water per person per day, by 2065 Washington County will need access to more than 29 billion gallons per year to quench the thirst of its population, businesses, farms and landscaping. At the upper estimate of 325 gallons per person per day, the county would go through more than 60 billion gallons of water each year.\n\nYet in 2021, the WCWCD reported that the reliable local supply of potable water currently tops out at 22.8 billion gallons per year, down from the 23.8 that was reported in a 2018 presentation by the WCWCD.\n\nA Solution?\n\nThe WCWCD, along with the Utah Division of Water Resources, saw this problem coming as early as the 1990s, and started making plans to import Colorado River water from Lake Powell via a buried pipeline that would stretch 140 miles through rocky desert terrain, crossing some tribal lands and sensitive habitats. The project has inched its way forward over the decades since, finally advancing its federally-required Environmental Impact Statement through the public review process during the Trump administration, which identified the pipeline as one of its infrastructure priorities.\n\nBut the project has also been mired in controversy since its inception, with objections raised about its economic feasibility, its environmental consequences and whether there will even be enough water in the Colorado River to fill the pipeline once it is built given recent record-setting droughts and ongoing climate-related flow declines. The Colorado River is currently the main source of water for 40 million people across the Southwest. But as the region’s population has grown and climate change has taken its toll, the river's two main reservoirs have dropped dramatically, exposing white layers of rock that had been submerged since the dams were built.\n\nControversy and science in the Colorado River Basin\n\nAs of late May, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reported that Lake Powell and Lake Mead were at 34% and 37% capacity, respectively. And that’s not expected to improve any time soon amid extreme drought and a dismally low snowpack at the river’s headwaters. Management of these two reservoirs, affecting access to diminished Colorado River flows by seven western states, is set to be renegotiated by 2026, which has incentivized states to create controversial governmental bodies charged solely with strategizing on their behalf, such as Utah’s new 6-member Colorado River Authority.\n\nRight now, though, the state of Utah still has untapped legal rights to water from the Colorado River per the original Colorado River Compact agreement of 1922. It intends to claim a portion of them via the Lake Powell Pipeline.\n\nThe Water Tap:Climate change and climate denial on the Colorado River\n\nConservation groups like Conserve Southwest Utah (CSU), a local nonprofit environmental advocacy group, say an abundance of recent science proves this plan is “unrealistic and irresponsible.” And a letter issued last fall from the six other states that rely on the Colorado River urging the secretary of the interior to hold off on approving the pipeline foreshadows widespread pushback against its construction.\n\n“It’s just not sustainable management to continue to build projects to take water out of the Colorado river,” said CSU board member Jane Whalen. “We know the river was over-allocated back in 1922 with the compact. There’s not enough water flowing in the system to fill all the allocations.”\n\nWCWCD’s General Manager, Zach Renstrom, however, argues that climate change is exactly the reason the pipeline should be built, since local water sources will also suffer declines that make them less capable of meeting the county’s growing needs.\n\n“Some of the more extreme models show that the Virgin River will have severe impacts from climate change,” Renstrom said last fall. “If we have that Biblical drought, the Virgin River is dry. Being able to tap into a larger project makes our supply here more reliable and safe.”\n\nStill, opponents heartily dispute the need for a second source given unexplored options to conserve and reuse more water locally. They claim that the original project needs assessment submitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in 2011 is based on an over-inflated population estimate that there would be 860,000 people in Washington County by 2060 and paltry water conservation goals that only expected residents to reduce daily use from 294 gallons in 2009 to 241 in 2060.\n\n\"Washington County Water District has plenty of capital to pick the lowest hanging fruit in water conservation and water demand reductions,\" said Zachary Frankel, the Executive Director of the Utah Rivers Council, a non-profit organization that seeks to protect Utah's watersheds. \"They just refuse to because they're focused on big ticket items and they need to keep water use high to justify the need for the Lake Powell Pipeline.\"\n\nOn which side of the pipeline is the grass greener?\n\nEnvironmentalists also point to other desert communities like Las Vegas which, after suffering legal losses over plans for a similar water pipeline that would have imported groundwater from near Nevada’s border with Utah’s Millard and Beaver Counties that the city spent $330 million developing, pivoted instead to make large conservation gains by ripping out turf grass and to reinforce infrastructure leading to their main existing source, Lake Mead.\n\nAdditional evidence suggests that reducing the amount of water spent on outdoor landscaping (60% of local home use, by WCWCD’s estimate) could free up a lot of Washington County’s local supplies for future residents. A 2020 study out of the University of Virginia looked at how 63 western counties had managed to reduce their overall water consumption between 2000 and 2015 despite growing populations. They found turf removal programs and rebates for updating home appliances to be the winning strategies. Indeed, California, Nevada and Arizona offer homeowners up to $3 per square foot of grass that they replace with desert-friendly landscaping.\n\nThe Water Tap:What's happening with water conservation rebates here and elsewhere?\n\nUtah does offer rebate programs to incentivize residents to upgrade to water-wise toilets, washing machines and outdoor irrigators. But local water officials have repeatedly said that turf removal is just not a good fit for the beehive state. Reasons cited include the high cost of such programs, an argument that the presence of grass serves as a buffer against future water cutbacks because you could instantly have more water available later by restricting outdoor watering, possible increases in urban temperatures from removing grass, government overreach and Utah’s historical, cultural adherence to a mission of “greening the desert.”\n\n“Most folks in Utah like the grass. And for a water manager to say you can't have grass, in my mind, is a little overbearing and beyond what we have the authority to say,” said Gene Shawcroft, Utah’s newly-appointed Colorado River Commissioner. “So first of all, it's a cultural issue.”\n\nWhat is most important to today's Utahns?\n\nDespite these sentiments about Utah’s cultural values driving water infrastructure decisions, there has never been a widespread, unbiased attempt to poll existing Washington County locals on their thoughts about the pros and cons of the Lake Powell Pipeline project and whether they are willing to bear its approximately $2 billion cost. So The Spectrum & Daily News, with funding from The Water Desk, designed and commissioned a survey to do just that.\n\nGetting Answers\n\nSurvey data were collected by the Utah-based market research firm Dynata, hired based on their reputation and reasonable cost quote. Employees of this company randomly selected residents of Washington County to contact for a phone survey and received responses from 400 of them. Respondents represented a balanced range of ages, gender, household income levels and length of time they had lived in Washington County. The results presented below have been weighted slightly by Dynata to best reflect the actual demographic makeup of the county.\n\nKnowledge is lacking\n\nOf the 400 people surveyed, nearly a quarter (22%) said they had never heard of the Lake Powell Pipeline, despite the fact that this is a decades-old project that will have major financial and lifestyle implications for all Washington County residents. 35% felt they “knew a little about it” and 12% felt they “knew a lot about it.” Only 52% of those surveyed said they felt they knew enough about the project to have an opinion on it.\n\nSupport is high\n\nSupport for the project outweighed opposition to it, with 59% expressing some level of support for it and 35% expressing some level of opposition to it. A majority held relatively mild views on the project, but 35% of all respondents were “very supportive” and 19% were “very opposed.”\n\nBut few want to pay\n\nThis high level of support, though, did not carry through to a willingness to help fund the project, which has been estimated to cost anywhere between $1.1 and $2.4 billion, to be initially bankrolled by the state and then repaid over 50 years by Washington County residents. In fact, some already-implemented increases in impact fees, property taxes and water rates are currently being put towards project expenses. The WCWCD estimates that the state has already spent around $40 million on planning costs and feasibility studies.\n\nOnly 40% of survey respondents answered yes to the question of whether, “knowing what you do about the project, and that the pipeline is proposed as a way to address potential water shortages in the future, are you willing to help fund it, either through increased water rates, higher taxes, or higher fees charged for new water hookups.” 44% answered no to that question and 15% declined to answer.\n\nAmong that 40% of people willing to help fund the project, just 8% said they would pay anything more than $50 per month in fees for it, though some estimates suggest the actual cost may be much higher than this. 22% of those who initially answered both that they supported the project and would be willing to help fund it then said that they would not be willing to contribute anything or refused to answer a question about specific amounts.\n\nOverall, then, 50% of all surveyed residents indicated at some point — either in response to the initial funding question or when asked about specific amounts — that they would not be willing to contribute financially to the project at all, despite the fact that some fees are already being collected county-wide to support it. An additional 18% of all those surveyed said that they were unsure about contributing or refused to answer the question. Less than 1% were willing to pay amounts in the highest tier.\n\nInstead, they show a willingness to conserve\n\nIn 2011, the Utah Division of Water Resources submitted a 256-page study to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission detailing how their water needs assessment justified pursuing the Lake Powell Pipeline project. In it, they outline how much water conservation they determined was “feasible for this area based on local conditions, development types, cost and public acceptance.” Conservation options that were considered but not deemed feasible to adopt included turf removal and some appliance rebates.\n\nSurvey results, however, indicate perhaps an increased willingness over the past decade to voluntarily adopt stricter water conservation measures.\n\nWhen asked if they would be “willing to adopt any conservation practices in your own home or accept fewer amenities in your community if it would help avoid construction of the project,” 63% of survey respondents said they would, including 48% of those who had expressed support for the project. Only 26% said they would not be willing to conserve more water and 11% said they didn’t know.\n\nSpecific measures respondents said they would be willing to adopt included high levels of support for conservation measures previously ruled out by state and local officials as conflicting with Utah’s traditional cultural values:\n\n75% of people who were amenable to conserving more water said they would reduce the size of their lawn.\n\n88% were willing to take shorter showers.\n\n75% were in favor of requiring desert-friendly landscaping in new housing developments.\n\n67% thought we should stop building water features in parks and public places.\n\n83% would support scaling back lawns in public places or on golf courses.\n\n78% would be willing to update their home appliances.\n\n76% supported increasing water rates/accelerating a tiered pricing structure.\n\nOver the next several weeks, The Spectrum & Daily News will be publishing additional stories in this series examining these survey responses in more detail. Watch for an in-depth look at the finances behind the Lake Powell Pipeline and a breakdown of water conservation attitudes.\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, results of our independent survey indicate that Washington County residents generally support the idea of the Lake Powell Pipeline project despite feeling that they don't know much about it. But few want to contribute to it financially and instead they expressed a greater willingness to adopt new water conservation practices than has previously been recognized.\n\nThe people of Washington County have spoken.\n\nMara Carabello, a public relations specialist working with Gene Shawcroft at Utah’s Colorado River Authority put it this way:\n\n“Letting the desert blossom like a rose has been Utah’s mantra for 200 years. We have such an interesting appetite [for green spaces] in Utah. We've got to start changing how we think of ourselves and how we think of this land.”\n\nJoan Meiners is an Environment Reporter for The Spectrum & Daily News through the Report for America initiative by The Ground Truth Project.

Here's what sets the months-long voyages ...", "text": "Brandee Lake’s home address changes nearly every day.\n\nThe 46-year-old boarded Royal Caribbean International’s Ultimate World Cruise in December and will live on the line’s Serenade of the Seas for the nine-month journey.\n\nLake, who previously lived in Los Angeles, gave up her apartment and left a job in advertising and marketing to travel full time, embarking on a 274-night sailing to more than 60 countries alongside her sister and parents.\n\n“I always tease that I only worked to travel anyway, that I worked to support my travel habit,” she told USA TODAY. “So, to me, it was a no-brainer.”\n\nLake, who had already visited 77 countries and lived abroad, decided to set sail and see even more of the world, and her parents gifted the cruise to her and her sister.\n\nVideos about the Ultimate World Cruise proliferated on TikTok following its departure from Miami, but it’s not the first cruise of its kind. World cruises offer passengers an easy way to travel the globe, delivering them to a range of far-flung destinations.\n\nBut there’s more to booking those trips than other kinds of cruises. Here’s what to know:\n\nWhat are world cruises?\n\nWorld cruises visit multiple continents, usually no less than three. The itineraries last between three and five months on average but can be longer, according to Joanna Kuther, a travel agent and owner of Port Side Travel Consultants.\n\n“You're in your room, and that's where you're going to be the whole time, and you're not flying around and packing and unpacking,” she said. While at a resort, guests might meet one another in passing, world cruise passengers are on the same itinerary for an extended period, which Kuther said can be “such a bonding experience.”\n\n“I mean, I guess it could go sideways if it was horrible people,” she said. “But I think people usually find their people.”\n\nFor travelers who can’t – or would rather not – spend so much time at sea, many cruise lines also sell segments of those itineraries separately. That allows guests to embark for days, weeks, or months at a time and adds new faces to the mix.\n\nWorld cruises also often take place on older ships, particularly on mainstream lines. \"I don't think they'd want one of their newest ships out of commission for months,\" Kuther added.\n\nHow do cruise lines plan world cruises?\n\nMapping out so many months at sea can take years. Luxury line Silversea Cruises, for example, plans its world cruises three to four years in advance, according to spokesperson Brad Ball.\n\n“Silversea has a team of destination experts that select destinations that are unique and culturally diverse,” he said in an email. The line, also part of Royal Caribbean Group, sailed its first world cruise in 2007 and works to create destination themes and make segments distinct.\n\nSilversea’s 140-day The Curious and the Sea voyage aboard Silver Dawn in 2026, for example, features a 28-day exploration of French Polynesia and the South Pacific, a semi-circumnavigation of Australia over 21 days and more.\n\n“We try to provision food items locally and source goods from the different regions we travel to as much as possible,” Ball added.\n\nMichael Bayley, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International, said the cruise line took great pains to anticipate guests’ needs on the Ultimate World Cruise, even putting a dentist on board.\n\nThe line also threw a gala dinner for guests before they departed. “I said, ‘The only one thing that we've failed to do, and I apologize now, is we failed to put a marriage counselor on board,’ ” he said during a press briefing last month on the line’s newest ship, Icon of the Seas.\n\nWhen should I book a world cruise?\n\nMany cruise lines offer only one world cruise a year, and staterooms go fast. Michael Bray, owner of Braycation Travel, likened it to “a really cool house coming on the market.”\n\n“The suites or larger cabins could go the fastest because folks want space,” he added. Bray said his clients have booked between 1 ½ to 2 ½ years out.\n\n“People know they have to plan to be with their homes for six months,” Bray said. “They've got to shut down their homes. You've got to figure out medications, mail, family, so this is not a shoot-from-the-hip decision.”\n\nLake, the Ultimate World Cruise passenger, said she stored some of her belongings with a friend and packed the rest of what she needed.\n\nTips for taking a long cruise:What to know about sailing for 6 months or more\n\nWorld cruises from lines like Cunard Line have long been popular, Kuther noted, but in recent years, more brands have leaned.\n\nRoyal Caribbean’s nine-month sailing is its first foray into the category, and Azamara is currently sailing its first world voyage since becoming an independent cruise line in 2021. Princess Cruises, which operated its first world cruise in 2008, also plans to sail its longest voyage ever (116 days) in 2025.\n\nKuther attributed that to a rise in remote-friendly jobs like content creation, particularly among younger people. “This ability to travel and work from wherever you are has opened up such a younger demographic and also more demand,” she said.\n\nBall at Silversea echoed that. “Over the past 15 years, we have seen increased demand for World Cruises, both from retired travelers as well as from working professionals and digital nomads,” he said. “Due to the advance of improved cellphone connectivity technology and onboard internet, more travelers are able to work remotely and better able to take longer voyages.”\n\nHow much do world cruises cost?\n\nStarting prices for world cruises on mainstream lines can range from around $25,000 per person to $60,000 depending on the length, Kuther said. Luxury world cruises are likely to cost upward of $70,000.\n\nThose prices will also likely include more than a typical cruise fare.\n\nThe fare for the entire Ultimate World Cruise – which started at around $54,000 for the full nine months – included gratuities, business class flights, Wi-Fi, wash-and-fold laundry service and more, according to Royal Caribbean’s website.\n\nLuxury lines, which already bundle more costs with their base fares, may throw in extras too. Ball said travelers who book Silversea’s 2026 world cruise get $1,000 in onboard credit per person (up to $2,000 per suite), a spa treatment and other amenities.\n\nFor Lake, the trip is a chance to see new places – like Antarctica, which she “always wanted to do” but never thought she would – while spending quality time with family. No matter where they are in the world, she has a family dinner with her parents and sister every night.\n\n“I think it's something that I'll look back on and never forget,” she said.\n\nAs for work after the cruise, she has no definitive plans, but has been posting about the trip on TikTok and is \"enjoying the creator space.\"\n\n\"I am seeing where this adventure and the world takes me,\" Lake said.\n\nNathan Diller is a consumer travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Nashville.

The state offered more information on Friday about the hourslong delay that observers said was troubling and unusual. A statement from the Alabama Department of Corrections did not elaborate on how long it took to establish the intravenous line or how many attempts were made. But a prison system spokeswoman confirmed the delay happened because of the time required to establish the IV connection. James was put to death for the 1994 murder of his ex-girlfriend Faith Hall, 26, more than 3 hours after the procedure originally was supposed to begin. The execution was set for 6 p.m. and the U.S. Supreme Court denied James’ request for a stay at 5:24 p.m. Reporters were taken to the grounds of Holman prison by van at about 6:30 p.m. to witness the execution, which did not get underway until about 9:04 p.m. The inmate was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. A delay of that length is unusual compared to executions conducted in Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlaska\n\nHaines: More than a year and half later, local and out-of-state organizations are still helping to repair damage from the dozens of landslides that occurred around the borough. The recovery work has evolved over time, said members of the Haines Long Term Recovery Group and other organizations involved in recovery efforts. The landslides, driven by unusually heavy rain, killed two, but were scarcely limited to that, said Sylvia Heinz, coordinator for the LTRG. Smaller landslides across Haines, which has a population of about 2,500, cut off roads, washed through houses and destroyed buildings. Heinz said there’s roughly 50 cases the LTRG is still dealing with, with issues ranging from damaged foundations to broken doors and windows, washed out culverts, driveways rendered impassable or physical or water damage from sliding debris. During the initial response, the borough focused its response on infrastructure projects that would be paid for or reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency, while other organizations focused on individual homeowners, said Harriet Brouillette, tribal administrator for the Chilkoot Indian Association. Organizations had to scramble to help out individual homeowners while the borough government focused on different projects.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Michael Sullivan, a law enforcement official overseeing police reform in Baltimore, has been tapped to lead the Phoenix Police Department, which has been the subject of a wide-ranging civil rights investigation. Sullivan, the deputy commissioner of compliance in Baltimore, will join the Phoenix agency in September as interim chief. He’s expected to serve up to two years while the city – the fifth-largest in the U.S. – searches for a permanent chief. The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether officers in Phoenix have used excessive force, abused people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness, engaged in discriminatory policing practices and retaliated against people exercising free speech, which is protected under the First Amendment. The investigation began last August. Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams announced in May that she’s retiring after a 33-year career in law enforcement, including six as chief. She’s expected to help Sullivan transition into the job.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a recreational marijuana initiative have turned in the required number of valid signatures, moving the measure closer to appearing on Arkansas’ ballot this fall, election officials said. A spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment had reached the 89,151 valid signatures from registered voters needed to qualify for the November ballot. The proposal’s name and ballot title still must be approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners to qualify for the ballot. The board is expected to review the measure Wednesday. More than 192,000 signatures were submitted July 8 for the proposal to allow people age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis. Arkansas voters in 2016 voted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. The secretary of state’s office did not have a final count on the number of valid signatures verified yet.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Bay Area Rapid Transit system is again requiring masks for travelers and employees. BART’s board of directors voted to immediately reinstate the mask mandate on all trains and in stations beyond ticket gates. It runs through Oct. 1 unless it’s extended again. The previous mask mandate started in April and ended on July 18. For 10 days, masking was optional but highly encouraged. BART serves commuters in San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. The board’s vote came hours after Los Angeles County public health officials dropped a plan to impose a universal indoor mask mandate last week as COVID-19 infections and rates of hospitalizations have stabilized. San Francisco and Los Angeles counties are at the “high” level of community transmission set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColorado\n\nKeystone: The U.S. Forest Service has stopped construction of a ski resort expansion after contractors mistakenly demolished protected alpine tundra for a temporary road. Officials raised their concern after seeing crews carving the new path into the protected land, beyond the area that the Forest Service and resort had initially agreed upon, The Colorado Sun reported. “We were surprised and disappointed to see this for sure,” said Scott Fitzwilliams, the supervisor of the White River National Forest for the U.S. Forest Service, adding the mistake “is not a catastrophic ecological event.” The federal agency issued a cease-and-desist letter in early July, suspending development of Keystone resort’s 555-acre expansion until the environmental impacts of the unauthorized road are measured. That could delay the opening of the the resort’s 16-trail expansion this winter, one of the largest capital investment plans in the resort industry. The company has since hired a restoration firm to help mitigate and repair the damage.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to install equipment designed to help prevent drivers from going the wrong way down the state’s highways after nearly a dozen wrong-way crashes led to 20 deaths this year. The effort came as transportation officials nationwide struggle to curtail a surge in fatalities on U.S. roads that began during the coronavirus pandemic. Connecticut’s $20 million planned program would install cameras on wrong-way signs across the state that will trigger flashing lights when a wrong-way driver is detected. There have been 11 fatal wrong-way accidents this year in the state, resulting in 20 deaths, according to statistics from the the Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut. That’s up from three fatal wrong-way crashes in 2020 and four in 2021, according to the Institute. The latest fatal crash occurred Sunday in Bridgeport. A van traveling the wrong way on Route 8 struck a car carrying a mother and her two children, police said. The mother was killed along with a passenger in the van. Officials said about 80% of the accidents involved drivers impaired by alcohol or other substances.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Former mortgage lender Trident Mortgage Company, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, must provide mortgage subsidies of up to $10,000 to homeowners in minority neighborhoods after claims of redlining, the Delaware Department of Justice said. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing amid the $20 million multistate settlement. Redlining, the practice of denying services to residents in minority neighborhoods, is prohibited by the Delaware Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act. “Redlining is one of the modern era’s most damaging and insidious forms of racism,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a written statement. “Few practices have done more to enforce de facto segregation in our communities.” Jennings worked with officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to reach Wednesday’s settlement. Although Trident was based in Devon, Pennsylvania, until its closure in December 2020, its services reached into nearby counties and states, including New Castle County. Its affiliate company Fox & Roach Realtors – which the Delaware DOJ said shared many customers with Trident – still operates in Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A mother on unemployment benefits said she has been left without weekly payments for four weeks after a breach in her D.C. Department of Employment Services account, WUSA-TV reported. Christina Paul said she first noticed something was wrong when she was unable to access her account June 8. After contacting the agency, she was informed her payment method had been changed from a debit card to a direct deposit, and her email had been changed. Since then, Paul said her account has been changed at least five times with new bank accounts and emails she does recognize. She has reported the incident to DC Police, but for the past month she has not received any payments leaving her out $1,6000. Paul said representatives from the agency told her the agency;s system had been breached. She said she was also told by the agency that her funds could not be distributed until the office recuperated the money. D.C.’s Department of Employment Services denied the security issue is from a potential hacking. The agency said it continues to aggressively work to minimize opportunities for cybercriminals to be successful and to mitigate risks. It is asking anyone who believes their funds have been improperly issued in their name to contact their office at (877)- 372-8360.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade School Board rescinded a decision made last week that rejected new sex education textbooks for middle and high school students. The debate over the sex education materials in Miami took place as school districts and boards navigate a new landscape in Florida classrooms over what officials deem appropriate content. Miami-Dade County has the nation’s fourth-largest public school system, with 334,000 students. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed new laws this year that prevent teachers from talking about gender identity and sexual orientation to third graders and younger and limiting how race can be discussed. The board approved the textbooks after Chair Perla Tabares Hantman changed her mind last week, citing the district needs to follow state standards and curriculum requirements. Hantman added the books are online and content that is not age appropriate is not accessible. She clarified parents are also allowed to opt their children out from lessons on sex education, tasking school officials with making a strong effort to let parents know.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMcDonough: Gov. Brian Kemp is using federal COVID-19 relief money to give teachers another $125 to buy school supplies, months after issuing a similar stipend. Kemp, a Republican running for reelection, made the announcement Friday at Ola High School in Henry County before teachers preparing for school to start this week. He said he learned firsthand how much teachers can spend buying supplies, learning aids and decorations for their classroom when his daughter started teaching first grade last year in Oconee County. Although January’s $125 supplement went only to teachers and paraprofessional teacher aides, state education officials said the new supplement will include others who provide instructional support on a daily basis, including counselors, librarians, school nurses and speech language pathologists. The last supplement cost about $15.9 million, said Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd. She said the total cost for this round of spending has yet to be completed. Teachers and others will get allocations in an online platform that they can use to order supplies. The money comes from federal COVID-19 aid that Kemp can give to schools. Georgia got two rounds of funding for public schools totaling $173 million that has been spent, plus $79 million in money for emergency aid to private schools. Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd said that because of federal requirements for spending the money, Georgia has $59.7 million left over in the nonpublic school account. She said federal education officials are letting states spend that money on public schools at Kemp’s discretion. The school supply grants are the first spending announced from those funds.\n\nHawaii\n\nMaui: Fire crews and helicopters were fighting a wildfire Saturday night on Maui near Paia Bay. The Maui County Emergency Management Agency said roads have been closed and have advised residents and travelers to avoid the area. It is unknown how many acres have burned. A red-flag warning was in effect Sunday.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: The Moose Fire in the Salmon-Challis National Forest has burned on more than 75 square miles in timbered land near the town of Salmon. It was 21% contained by Sunday morning. Pila Malolo, planning operations section chief on the fire, said in a Facebook video update that hot, dry conditions were expected to persist Sunday. Officials said they expected fire growth in steep, rugged country on the fire’s south side.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Google is moving into the Thompson Center, the iconic state building in downtown Chicago, officials said. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state is selling the building to a developer for $30 million in cash and also getting another downtown building valued at $75 million. Google, which has more than 1,800 employees in Chicago, said it will control the building after a major renovation and occupy it by 2026. The Thompson Center, a hulking all-glass building designed by Helmut Jahn, opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It was renamed in 1993 for James “Big Jim” Thompson, who served as governor from 1977-91. JRTC Holdings LLC will renovate the Thompson Center to meet Google’s needs. The state, meanwhile, will move nearly 1,800 employees from the Thompson Center and other downtown office space to the newly acquired building on South LaSalle Street.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State senators narrowly passed a near-total abortion ban Saturday during a rare weekend session, sending the bill to the House after a contentious week of arguments over whether to allow exceptions for rape and incest. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 26-20 after about 3 hours of debate, passing the bill with the minimum 26 votes needed to send it to the House, which Republicans also control. The bill would prohibit abortions from the time a fertilized egg implants in a uterus. Exceptions would be allowed in cases of rape and incest, but a patient seeking an abortion for either reason would have to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to the attack. Indiana is one of the first Republican-controlled states to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. But the GOP splintered after the rape and incest exceptions remained in the bill Thursday, when an amendment failed that would have stripped out those exceptions. Ten Republican senators voted against the legislation Saturday, including a handful who support abortion rights. House Speaker Todd Huston on Friday declined to discuss specifics of the Senate bill. But he said he supports the rape and incest exceptions.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Dubuque County Conservation has been making steady progress in developing its canoeing and kayaking infrastructure, with the intended destination of a countywide water trail in the coming years. The development of kayaking opportunities was identified as a top priority through public input gathered during the department’s long-term strategic planning process in 2020. In response, Dubuque County funded a recently completed project at Bowstring Wildlife Area to create better water access for paddlers and further the county’s water quality improvement goals. The conservation department recently finished a streambank stabilization project in the wildlife area along Lytle Creek, a project that included seeding the banks with prairie grasses. Workers installed a crossing on the creek so conservation staff can maintain the prairie, but it also will serve as a kayak launch point. Dubuque County will be the second area county to finish a water trail plan. Delaware County officials previously developed one for the Maquoketa River, which helped lead to the development of Manchester Whitewater Park.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A law allowing deadly force against an attacker doesn’t protect people from prosecution if a bystander is injured, the state’s highest court ruled. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in the case of a Wichita police officer whose shots at a charging dog wounded a 9-year-old girl. The justices ordered a trial in Sedgwick County District Court for former Officer Dexter Betts on a charge of felony reckless aggravated battery. The December 2017 shooting happened after Betts and other officers responded to a call about domestic violence and a suicide threat at a Wichita home. Once inside, the dog charged at Betts, and he fired twice. His shots missed and hit the floor, and bullet fragments hit the girl above an eye and on a toe, according to the court’s decision. Betts argued he acted in self defense. A judge dismissed the case before trial, and the Kansas Court of Appeals upheld that decision. But Supreme Court Justice Dan Biles, writing for a unanimous state Supreme Court, said Kansas law grants immunity from prosecution for force used specifically against an attacker and doesn’t mention bystanders. Jess Hoeme, Betts’ attorney, said he believes Betts will be acquitted at trial, but expressed concern that the ruling could hinder law enforcement and endanger officers. Hoeme said the ruling is “unfortunate” because Betts didn’t intend to hurt any person while shooting and the bullets fragmented. But prosecutors have argued that Betts acted recklessly in shooting at the dog with the girl nearby. A conviction on a reckless aggravated battery charge for a first-time offender carries a presumed sentence of 18 months’ probation.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools offered to continue providing adult education services until June 30, 2023, a spokesperson for Kentucky’s Education and Workforce Development Cabinet said. “At that time, JCPS will review the success of their adult education services against federal performance indicators and state achievement goals to determine if they will seek renewal for the remaining two years of the original contract,” spokesperson Rosalind Harvey said. Kentucky’s largest school district previously told state officials it would be cutting a three-year contract to provide adult education in Louisville short, ending the program in December and shifting the responsibility of the program to another entity. The move blindsided those working in the adult education program, many of whom began contacting school board members and reporters to protest the change. Although district officials signaled the decision was final, school board chairwoman Diane Porter said the decision to end district control of the program rests with the board.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBelle Chasse: The state has completed one of its largest coastal restoration projects yet, and is at work on even larger ones. The dredge used to suck up sediment from the Gulf of Mexico to add 1,000 acres of habitat to sites in the Terrebonne Basin is now at work in the Mississippi River, doing the same for a 1,600-acre project that’s further east and named for a historic Plaquemines Parish outlet called Spanish Pass, officials said last week. “These are key examples of our front-line defense” against hurricanes, said Bren Haase, executive director of the state Coastal Preservation and Restoration Authority. They had been eaten away by erosion and subsidence – and by sea level rise. On Tuesday, the authority announced completion of another project – the addition of about 256 acres of beach and dune and 143 acres of marsh on West Grand Terre Island. Barrier islands and marshes slow storm surge, so the work protects people and buildings on shore while providing a habitat for plants and animals. The Spanish Pass project starts just outside the Plaquemines Parish town of Venice. The fragility of the wetlands fringing Louisiana’s coast was illustrated less than a minute by seaplane from the project’s west end. In that spot, trees grow in parallel lines on relatively high ground in open water. They mark the banks of canals dredged through marshes that no longer exist.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Vessels off the East Coast must slow more often to help save North Atlantic right whales from extinction, the federal government said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the announcement via new proposed rules designed to prevent ships colliding with the whales. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are the largest threats to the giant mammals, which number less than 340 and are falling in population. Efforts to save the whales have long focused on fishing gear, especially that used by East Coast lobster fishermen. The proposed vessel speed rules signal the government wants the shipping industry to take more responsibility. The new rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast that require mariners to slow to 10 knots. They would also require more vessels to comply with the rules by expanding the size classes that must slow. The rules also stated the NOAA would create a framework to implement mandatory speed restrictions when whales are known to be present outside the seasonal slow zones.\n\nMaryland\n\nEmmitsburg: A 26-foot statue of the Virgin Mary is back in place at a Catholic university in Maryland. The Frederick News-Post reported the statue has been put back in place atop a 78-foot pedestal at the National Shrine Grotto on the campus of Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg after a year of restoration work. That work continues even as the statue is back in place, surrounded by scaffolding. Workers are now in the process of layering gold leaf to statue’s exterior. The university has raised $400,000 to support the restoration; about $450,000 more is needed. The statue is expected to be completed next month, with a formal ceremony planned for October. The grotto draws about 300,000 visitors a year; it is a replica of the grotto in Lourdes, France, that draws pilgrims to a site where believers said the Virgin Mary appeared in the 19th century.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker sent back to lawmakers on Friday a bill mandating some of the steps the state needs to take to meet a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a letter to lawmakers, the Republican governor said he agreed with much in the bill but suggested some changes. Although the bill encourages the development of offshore wind, which Baker supports, he said the state needs to look to other sources of what he described as clean energy to meet its emissions goals. To do that, Baker said he is again asking lawmakers to put $750 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds into a clean energy investment fund. Baker also said the legislation needs to do more to ensue improvements to energy transmission systems. The state House approved the bill on a 143-9 vote. The Senate then voted 38-2 in favor of the bill before sending it to Baker last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Health Department is offering vaccines to residents who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus or suspect they have been exposed. The department said it is offering the Jynneos vaccine at its office from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and at the Wayne HIV/STI Clinic from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and on the first and third Saturdays of the month from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The vaccines will be provided to prevent development of the virus in people who have been exposed to it and to people with risk behaviors in places, events or venues with known transmission of the virus over the previous two weeks, the department said. Ten of Michigan’s known 37 cases of the virus have been seen in Detroit, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen said he supports abortions for victims of rape and incest, altering his stance from previous comments he described as clumsy. Jensen told Minnesota Public Radio in May he didn’t support exceptions for rape and incest unless the life of the mother was in danger. He said in a video released Friday that if he had been unclear previously, he wanted to set the record straight. “I never thought it necessary to try and identify what those exceptions might be in regards to legal abortion or not because I always thought when I uphold the pregnant woman’s life, and if her mental and physical health is in danger or jeopardized, that’s all that needs to be said,” Jensen said. Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Ken Martin said Jensen is trying to walk back previous comments and believed if elected, the Watertown family physician would attempt to pass an abortion law without rape and incest exceptions, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has seized control of a Mississippi jail after citing “severely deficient” conditions at the facility. In a Friday ruling, U.S. Southern District of Mississippi Judge Carlton Reeves placed Hinds County’s Raymond Detention Center into receivership. The judge will soon appoint an expert, known as a “receiver,” to temporarily manage the facility in hopes of improving its conditions. “After ample time and opportunity, regretfully, it is clear that the county is incapable, or unwilling, to handle its affairs,” the judge wrote. “Additional intervention is required. It is time to appoint a receiver.” Reeves said deficiencies in supervision and staffing lead to “a stunning array of assaults, as well as deaths.” Seven individuals died last year while detained at the jail, he said. County officials said they’re still digesting the order and are determining whether they will appeal, WLBT-TV reported. Reeves’ decision came months after he agreed to scale back the county’s jail 2016 consent decree with the federal government to address “unconstitutional conditions” at Raymond and two other facilities that comprise the Hinds County jail system.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Families started lining up outside the Springfield Expo Center an hour before the Back To School Bash was scheduled to open Saturday. The event offered free backpacks, hygiene kits, immunizations, and physicals plus fun activities, including bounce houses, esports, games and robotics. At the event, the first of its kind for the district, Convoy of Hope passed out bags of groceries to families to celebrate having served more than 200 million people since it was founded in 1994. To get parents and children out of the rain faster, Springfield Public Schools opened doors 30 minutes early. “This is the first time we have planned a back-to-school event on this scale,” said Springfield Public Schools Superintendent Grenita Lathan. “We want families to come, enjoy themselves and have the opportunity to access resources that will help them be ready for the first day of school.” The new school year starts Aug. 22.\n\nMontana\n\nElmo: A blaze sparked in grasslands in northwest Montana, grew to more than 11 square miles after advancing into forest. A portion of Highway 28 between Hot Springs and Elmo was closed because of the thick smoke, according to the Montana Department of Transportation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific will spend more than $1 billion to upgrade 600 of its old diesel locomotives over the next three years and make them more efficient, but regulators still want it to do more to cut pollution from its engines. The move will accelerate the pace of upgrades the company planned to make and help the Omaha-based railroad cut roughly 210,000 tons of carbon emissions each year – the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road. The railroad will go from modernizing 120 locomotives this year to modernizing 200 a year in each of the next three years. “It’s really taking the older locomotive fleet and applying the latest and greatest to get one of the most fuel efficient locomotives we can have,” said Grace Olsen, who oversees locomotive engineering for Union Pacific. The railroad estimated this program will improve the fuel efficiency of long-haul locomotives by up to 18% and help them produce peak power more reliably. To accomplish that, locomotive manufacturer Wabtec will strip down the locomotives, and spend eight weeks overhauling their engines and installing new software and electronic controls. The improved power will let Union Pacific pull the same amount of freight with fewer locomotives.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Intense thunderstorms drenched parts of the city, causing water to cascade from casino ceilings and pool on the carpet of a stadium-sized sports betting area. Although only three-tenths of an inch of rain was registered at Las Vegas’ airport late Thursday, more than an inch fell just a mile away at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Nearby wind gusts peaked at 71 mph and toppled trees. Pea-sized hail fell from lightning-streaked skies in suburban Henderson, where almost an inch of rain fell in some areas. Police, county and city officials and the National Weather Service said no injuries or widespread damage was reported. Casino patrons posted videos of water pouring from ceilings at Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and from behind a huge video display at the downtown Circa hotel-casino sports book. One video showed a man continuing to gamble at a casino slot machine while water fell around him.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Members of a rescue group carried the body of a hiker nearly a mile in freezing temperatures and high winds after the man died on the Northeast’s highest mountain, authorities said. A group of hikers found the man unconscious and not breathing on Mount Washington’s Jewell Trail on Saturday afternoon, the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game said. They called 911 and started performing CPR. Members of one rescue group drove to the summit of the nearly 6,300-foot mountain and hiked down to the man, while another group rode up the mountain’s famous Cog Railway and hiked in. With no sign of life after 40 minutes, resuscitation efforts ceased, and rescue group members carried the body nearly a mile to the train. A dog the man was hiking with was taken to an animal shelter until it can be reunited with the man’s family.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices posted another double-digit drop in New Jersey amid low demand. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.41, down 10 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.18 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.25, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.16 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nShiprock: Samuel Sandoval, one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages in World War II using a code based on their native language, has died. Sandoval died late Friday at a hospital in Shiprock, his wife, Malula, told The Associated Press on Saturday. He was 98. Hundreds of Navajos were recruited from the vast Navajo Nation to serve as Code Talkers with the U.S. Marine Corps. Only three are still alive today: Peter MacDonald, John Kinsel Sr. and Thomas H. Begay. The Code Talkers took part in every assault the Marines conducted in the Pacific, sending thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s outcome. The code, based on the then-unwritten Navajo language, confounded Japanese military cryptologists and is credited with helping the U.S. win the war. Sandoval was on Okinawa when he got word from another Navajo Code Talker the Japanese had surrendered and relayed the message to higher-ups. The Navajo men are celebrated annually on Aug. 14. Samuel Sandoval was looking forward to that date and seeing a museum built near the Navajo Nation capital of Window Rock, Arizona, to honor the Code Talkers, his wife said.\n\nNew York\n\nBabylon: Shark sightings have become more common along Long Island’s shores this summer – and not just the mostly harmless, abundant dogfish. Since June, there have been at least five verified encounters where sharks bit swimmers and surfers. Although there were no fatalities, sightings prompted officials to temporarily close some beaches to swimming, from New York City’s Rockaway Beach to Long Island’s Smith Point County Park, where a surfer beat a shark on its snout after it bit his calf. George Gorman, regional director for the state park system on Long Island, referred to the recent shark interactions as “extraordinarily unusual.” Sharks aren’t new to New York’s waters. Sand tiger, sandbar and dusky sharks are some of the more common species found near shore. But in the last century or so, New York state had documented only 13 shark attacks. Experts said sharks aren’t setting out to dine on people, but instead are chasing bunker fish near beaches. Recent shark bites are likely mistakes, Gorman said. Swimmers might also be interacting with sharks while they are feeding.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court has agreed to accelerate arguments on further challenges to the boundaries for the state’s legislative seats and congressional districts. By a 4-3 ruling, the justices granted a request by Common Cause to accelerate the redistricting proceedings before them. The group is fighting the state House and Senate maps approved by the General Assembly in February. Oral arguments will be held in early or mid-October, according to Thursday’s order signed by Senior Associate Justice Robin Hudson. The order said specifically the court didn’t address a recent request by Republican legislators to end its appeal of the congressional district boundaries, which a state trial court drew and adopted for use this year only. But the order said expediting all redistricting appeals was based on “the great public interest in the subject matter of this case, the importance of the issues to the constitutional jurisprudence of this state, and the need to reach a final resolution on the merits at the earliest possible opportunity.” It’s too late for any decision after those oral arguments to alter the district lines for this year’s elections, which are happening under the challenged maps. Any ruling could clarify further how partisan bias is avoided in map making and force the Legislature to redraw new General Assembly maps that would be used for the remainder of the decade. A new congressional map for the 2024 elections already will be needed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: International Music Camp founder Merton Utgaard will receive North Dakota’s highest honor, Gov. Doug Burgum said. Utgaard, who died in 1998 at age 84, is the 47th recipient of the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A ceremony will be scheduled at a later date. Utgaard, a native of Maddock, founded the music camp in 1956 at the International Peace Garden that sits astride the North Dakota and Canadian border, north of Dunseith. He served as director for 28 years. At the time of his death, more than 90,000 students from more than 60 countries had attended the summer camp. Utgaard was a teacher and director of bands at the University of Minnesota, the University of South Dakota, Ball State University, Northern Illinois University and the University of Manitoba-Brandon before he began to work full time on the International Music Camp in the mid-1960s. Utgaard’s portrait will hang in the North Dakota Capitol with those of the other 46 people who have received the award, established by Gov. William Guy in 1961.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens:Ohio University is reinstating its indoor mask mandate starting Monday. The mask mandate is going into effect because Athens County is listed as having a high level of transmission on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest COVID-19 data tracker, according to the university’s website. Ohio University is the first public university in the state to reinstate a mask mandate after colleges and universities shed their mandates in the spring. OU’s classes begin Aug. 22. The university’s mask mandate will drop when the level of COVID-19 transmission in Athens County goes down to medium. Masks will be recommended during scheduled class and class-related activities when the level of transmission is medium. Masks will be optional when the level of COVID-19 transmission is low in Athens County. Ohio State University is not requiring masks, university spokesman Ben Johnson said in an email.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Contraband including weapons, cellphones, drones and grappling hooks believed to be headed to state prisons was seized at a warehouse in Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said Friday. The department’s Office of Inspector General learned of the contraband and raided the warehouse on July 15, with Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics agents, according to a news release from Corrections Department spokesperson Josh Ward. Justin Brown, another spokesperson for the department, said few other details could be released because it involves an ongoing investigation into contraband being smuggled into prisons. Seized items included 31 cellphones, which have been used to run drug rings from prisons and to coordinate inmate violence, such as fights in 2019 at several state prisons that left one inmate dead and dozens injured. Ammunition, drugs, tobacco and $8,500 in counterfeit $100 bills were also seized. The grappling hooks were intended to retrieve the contraband, the Oklahoma Corrections Department said. Drones have been used to deliver contraband into prisons nationwide, including federal prisons, leading to charges this month in Beaumont, Texas. No arrests were announced, but Inspector General Ted Woodhead said charges are expected against “numerous individuals” at the end of what he said is an ongoing investigation into the contraband.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: New state rules require access to water, shade and breaks on hot days, but workers said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions. Skyler Fischer, a forklift driver at a Fred Meyer distribution center in the town of Clackamas, has been working there for 12 years and works at least four days a week, 10 to 12 hours each day. Fischer said he gets two 15-minute breaks each shift. In May, the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division adopted permanent rules to protect workers laboring in excessive heat or wildfire smoke. They are some of the nation’s strongest protections for employees working outdoors or in workplaces without air conditioning. But last week, with daily highs consistently hitting triple-digits, Oregon OSHA’s recently implemented heat rules were put to the test. Some Oregonians have said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions despite the new heat rules. The rules went into effect last month and apply when temperatures in a work environment reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They require employers to provide access to shaded areas, cool drinking water, and additional rest breaks to cool down and acclimate to the heat. The rule also requires employers to provide heat illness prevention training. Aaron Corvin, Oregon OSHA’s public information officer, said the agency has opened an inspection related to the Fred Meyer facility. A statement from Fred Meyer said the company has installed a mechanical cooling station at its 1-million-square-foot warehouse in Clackamas. On days with high temperatures, the company provides employees with access to water bottles on ice, water fountains, frozen treats and cooling towels. A distribution team also takes daily temperatures throughout the facility and said this week temperatures have not exceeded 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the statement said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A fast-moving fire damaged Jim’s Steaks on South Street, one of Philadelphia’s best-known cheesesteak shops, early Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. Dozens of firefighters and other emergency responders went to Jim’s Steaks when the fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. Smoke could be seen pouring from the building, but officials said all the employees were able to safely evacuate the structure. It wasn’t immediately known how many people were in the building when the fire broke out. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Jim’s Steaks opened its original location in Philadelphia in 1939. The South Street location opened in 1976.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: Law enforcement handed out more than a dozen citations for boating violations Saturday during an annual party on the water that has become known as “Aquapalooza.” Two boats sank. At least two boat operators were cited for “boating under the influence.” Two other revelers were taken away for emergency medical treatment, including one with a leg injury from a moving propeller. Harbormaster Bruce Celico said this year’s event was the largest yet, drawing more than 1,000 boats and Jet Skis.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Three horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia, a blood-borne, potentially deadly illness, the Clemson University Public Service and Agriculture unit reported Friday. The first case was in a quarter horse in Berkeley County. The other two quarter-horse cases are in Barnwell County, state Veterinarian Michael Neault said in a news release. These are the first cases of the illness in South Carolina since 2014, when a donkey tested positive in Aiken County, Neault said. The virus that causes EIA is often transmitted by bloodsucking insects such as biting flies but also can be introduced by infected needles or other medical, dental or tattoo equipment. The illness does not affect humans but is potentially deadly to horses and other equine species, Neault said. The infected horse in Berkeley County has been euthanized. Clemson University’s Livestock Poultry Health regulatory agency, which Neault also directs, is discussing options with the owners of the two affected horses in Barnwell County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Oglala Sioux Tribe is suing the federal government for failing to provide adequate law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The lawsuit filed last week against the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in the Interior Department alleged the inadequacy has created a “public safety crisis” on the reservation. Tribal officials said Pine Ridge, with its 3 million acres of land, has just 33 police officers and eight criminal investigators who handled more than 133,700 emergency calls last year. And, that there were six to eight officers on any given shift. The complaint uses Rapid City as a comparison with its 176 police officers who handled nearly 115,000 emergency calls in 2021, the Argus Leader reported. The tribe said the Bureau of Indian Affairs is out of compliance with its standards of having 2.8 officers per 1,000 people. For Pine Ridge, that would require at least 140 tribal officers. Court documents said officers are working an average of 80 hours of overtime on top of their 160 scheduled hours and do not have adequate backup when needed for emergency calls.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Six people have applied to replace Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, who won’t be seeking another term. The Tennessee Supreme Court announced Don Cochran, Jerome Cochran, Michael Dunavant, R. Culver Schmid, Jonathan Skrmetti and Bill Young submitted applications for the opening by Friday’s deadline. Tennessee is the only state in which the attorney general is appointed by the Supreme Court. The position runs in eight-year terms. The new term begins Sept. 1. The court’s justices selected Slatery in 2014 after he previously served as former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam’s chief legal counsel. Interviews will be held on Aug. 8 and 9 at the Tennessee Supreme Court building in Nashville. They will also be livestreamed at www.youtube.com/user/TNCourts/featured.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Sunlight magnified by glass bottles in an open garbage can ignited paper trash, starting a 500-acre wildfire in north Texas that destroyed five homes, fire officials said. The July 18 fire on Possum Kingdom Lake’s western shore, about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, took eight days to fully contain. Chief Bonnie Watkins of the Possum Kingdom West Side Volunteer Fire Department found a trash can packed with party trash that included paper goods, food and numerous glass bottles, according to a department statement. Watkins concluded a wind gust opened the can lid, allowing sunlight magnified by the glass bottles to ignite the paper. The fire built rapidly until the fire spilled from the can and spread to nearby cedar trees, the statement said. Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas, a nonprofit insurance industry association, said he had never heard of such a freakish cause for a wildfire.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Three people, including a juvenile, have been arrested over an alleged vandalism spree at church buildings across the city owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Police found reports of broken windows at 14 churches across Washington County spanning multiple dates, according to arresting documents filed in 5th District Court. The first incident was reported to police on July 18. All of the damage was done at churches owned by the Latter-day Saints, which make up Utah's predominant religious denomination. The estimated cost of the damage done was $5,000. Two of the three individuals, one adult and one juvenile, reportedly admitted to their involvement, according to police. The adult is Nathan Monroy, 18, who was arrested and placed in the Purgatory Correctional Facility on a second-degree felony charge of criminal mischief. The juvenile was also arrested and placed in the Dixie Area Detention. Another adult, Zachary Steele, 18, was arrested later by Washington City officers and faces the same charge.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy on Friday was discharged from a rehabilitation center following his second surgery to help repair a broken hip, his office said. Leahy, 82, fell and broke his hip last month in his Virginia home. He underwent hip-replacement surgery June 30 at a Washington-area hospital. He was then moved to a rehabilitation center. An additional operation was done July 20. He and his wife, Marcelle, returned to the home Friday. Leahy plans to return to the Senate this week. On his way home, he went to the Capitol to sign a newly passed bill that would boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research. As President Pro Tempore of the Senate, his signature is required, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, before the bill can be sent to President Joe Biden. Leahy, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, is not seeking reelection in November. When Leahy’s current term expires in January 2023, he will have served for 48 years in the Senate.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Colette McEachin said she won’t file criminal charges against police officers who deployed tear gas on demonstrators gathered at the city’s Robert E. Lee statue in 2020 to protest police violence. McEachin said confused police radio communications led officers to use tear gas on a peaceful group of protestors who gathered at the statue on June 1, 2020, in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She said her review showed that police commanders authorized tear gas to be used at the nearby J.E.B. Stuart monument, where a smaller group of protesters was trying to topple the statue. She said radio transmissions simply referred to “the monument,” and officers at the Lee monument wrongly believed the use of tear gas had been authorized there. Richmond Police quickly apologized for the use of tear gas at the Lee statue and said it was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned.\n\nWashington\n\nSedro-Wolley: A woman was arrested after she allegedly left her family’s dog on a balcony without water or shade during dangerous high temperatures, resulting in the dog’s death. A police animal control officer responded to calls from concerned neighbors and found the 5-year-old dog named Enzo in “severe distress.” He displayed symptoms including seizing and foaming at the mouth. The officer took life-saving measures, moving the dog inside and trying to cool him down, but Enzo died, KING5 reported. His body was taken to an emergency medical facility where its internal temperature was at least 107 degrees – the maximum temperature the vet’s thermometer could detect, according to court documents. The dog’s water bowl was empty and there were signs he had pawed at the sliding door. In addition, neighbors and nearby workers reportedly heard a dog in distress. Temperatures in Sedro-Wolley reached nearly 90 degrees on Tuesday and officers measured one surface of the balcony at 131 degrees with an infrared heat camera, according to court documents. The woman told police she had been preparing for her son’s birthday and did not check the water bowl or consider the temperature on the deck, though she told police she was aware of the forecast for the day, court documents said. The woman was charged with first-degree animal cruelty and released on her own recognizance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wheeling attorney Elgine McArdle was elected chair of the West Virginia Republican Party. McArdle was chosen during a meeting of the state GOP executive committee in Charleston. McArdle has been a member of the committee since 2005. She succeeds Mark Harris, who chose not to seek a full four-year term after he was picked in March 2021 to serve the remainder of former chair Melody Potter’s term. McArdle also spent five years as an assistant federal prosecutor for the state’s northern district.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Investigators said two Dane County deputies investigating a case of road rage were injured when an alleged drunken driver crashed into their squad cars late Friday. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, the Dane County Sheriff’s Office said. The incident happened in the town of Springfield, where authorities said a person was shot and injured in a dispute near the intersection of two highways. The suspect in that incident fled the scene and was later arrested. The person who was shot is expected to survive. The deputies who responded to the scene were standing outside of their cars when the drunken-driving suspect crashed into their vehicles. They were taken to a local hospital for treatment. The driver was arrested for operating while intoxicated causing injury.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan has been named by Gov. Mark Gordon a judge for the 8th Judicial District, serving Goshen County, his home county, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The newspaper reported Buchanan said he would not seek a second term after Judge Patrick W. Korrell announced his retirement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/09/09/river-troll-cob-cornstalk-batman-escort-news-around-states/40100855/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A memorial is being dedicated to two black men who were killed in what are described as racist lynchings near the city in the 1890s. The Jefferson County Memorial Project says it will dedicate a marker to Tom Redmond and Jake McKenzie at Sloss Furnaces on Monday night. An announcement says both men worked at mines owned by Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel, and both were killed in the old mining town of Brookside during confrontations with police. Redmond was killed during a shootout near a company store in 1890. McKenzie was fatally shot seven years later when a city marshal attempted to arrest a black man for abusive language. A statement by Mayor Randall Woodfin describes both men as victims of “unspeakable hate.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state’s hot, dry summer has led to severe drought conditions in some communities, which are struggling to meet their water needs. The arid conditions are widespread but acutely felt in a handful of small communities that rely on snow melt and rain to fill their reserves. Among the worst hit have been the Alutiiq communities of Nanwalek and Seldovia in the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. Their plight prompted regional officials to issue a disaster declaration. Nanwalek is shutting off the public water supply 12 hours each day and barging in jugs of water to deal with water shortages. In the Alutiiq community of Seldovia, automatic flush toilets have been switched to manual flushing, and restaurants are serving meals on paper plates.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Inmates have asked a federal judge to take over health care operations in all state-run prisons and appoint an official to run medical and mental health services due to Arizona’s repeated failure to improve the care. Attorneys representing 34,000 inmates said in a filing Friday that the state has failed to fulfill many of the improvements to inmate care that it promised nearly five years ago when the case was settled. The takeover request marks an escalation in the litigation in which the state has repeatedly been accused of dragging its feet. Previously, the state has been fined for failing to follow through on its promises. In the latest request, the inmates requested a receivership be ordered to run health care operations in prisons and asked the judge to follow through on her earlier threat to impose a second contempt-of-court fine against the state for noncompliance.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: A newspaper that was expected to shut down Friday has a new owner. GateHouse Media said it has entered an agreement to sell the Helena-West Helena World to a pair of local entrepreneurs. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but new owners Andrew Bagley and Chuck Davis said they intend to publish the newspaper weekly. Last week, GateHouse announced that the Helena-West Helena paper would shut down along with the Stuttgart Daily Leader. The Stuttgart newspaper reports that negotiations are underway for a new buyer there, but nothing has been finalized. GateHouse publishes 154 daily newspapers, most in small- and mid-sized towns. In August, GateHouse announced it was merging with fellow newspaper giant Gannett, USA TODAY’s parent company.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Homeowners forced to rebuild because of a wildfire won’t have to install solar panels under a new law signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom. New rules taking effect Jan. 1 make California the first state in the country to require solar panels on new homes. But thousands of homes across the Golden State have been damaged or destroyed in recent years because of wildfires and other natural disasters. Newsom signed a bill Friday that temporarily exempts homes from the rules in areas where the governor has declared a state of emergency prior to Jan. 1, 2020. The exemption would expire in 2023. Newsom said he supports efforts to rebuild communities as fast as possible. But he urged all Californians to consider installing solar panels.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has taken the unusual step of inviting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to downgrade the air quality rating of its biggest population center, and not everyone thinks that was a good idea. The EPA held a hearing Friday on whether to lower the ozone status of Denver and eight other northern Colorado counties from “moderate” to “serious.” That would force the state to work harder to reduce harmful pollution but also bring tougher and costly regulations for businesses. The agency expects to decide by the end of the year. The EPA acted after Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in March that Colorado would no longer ask for an exemption from EPA standards by claiming some of the pollution was drifting into the state from elsewhere. It’s time to stop “sugar-coating” Colorado’s air problems, he said last month.\n\nConnecticut\n\nLedyard: The state’s hemp industry is beginning to take off. Gov. Ned Lamont announced last week that the state has licensed 82 hemp growers, two processors and 21 manufacturers under a pilot program the Democrat signed into law earlier this year. The law allows for the cultivation, harvesting, processing, and manufacturing of hemp plants and by-products in the state. In total, 294 acres of land are being used to grow hemp in Connecticut. Under the law, which created a new industrial hemp research project, anyone who plans to manufacture hemp products that are consumed in any way by people – such as food products, lotions or oils – must obtain a license from the state Department of Consumer Protection. Lamont said the program is creating more opportunities in the agricultural industry.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The first woman to lead Delaware State University as president has announced her retirement after a little more than a year in the role. News outlets report Wilma Mishoe announced Thursday that she’ll retire at the end of December. Tony Allen, the current executive vice president and provost of the university, will take over as president. Mishoe officially assumed her role in July 2018, having served as interim president since January 2018. She became the first woman to lead the state’s only historically black university. Mishoe had previously left retirement to lead Delaware State. Allen says it was Mishoe’s expectation that she’d help “stabilize” the school, then enter retirement again.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C. councilmembers have asked government officials to examine a local company that has no employees and yet was given the largest workload and payout from a $215 million no-bid sports gambling contract. The Washington Post reports Robert C. White Jr. and Elissa Silverman want an investigation into Veterans Services Corp., which is contracted by Intralot for sports betting and city lottery work. Their votes were crucial in awarding Intralot the sole-source contract, despite concerns about subcontractors, some of whom are connected to local officials. The newspaper says Veterans Services has no employees and lists executives on its website who don’t actually work there.\n\nFlorida\n\nCrystal River: It wasn’t Gotham City, but Batman descended on a local preschool to help a 3-year-old girl who was being bullied. When Erica Calculli’s daughter Lydia came home from school with bruises on her face, she chalked it up to regular kids’ play. But then Lydia came home with a swollen black eye last month. The little girl told her mother that her classmates hit her and threw a shoe at her. Calculli says she reported the incident to her daughter’s school, but nothing came of it. She turned to social media, where Batman impersonator Jack Asbury saw the post and offered to walk the little girl to school. Calculli posted an adorable photo of the shy girl holding the black-caped superhero’s hand in the classroom. WTSP reports the toddler has since been moved to an advanced learning class.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMarietta: Many Cobb County voters will cast hand-marked paper ballots in Nov. 5 municipal elections as a backup plan for the state’s election equipment ordered by a federal judge. News outlets report paper ballots will be trialed in Austell, Kennesaw, Powder Springs and Smyrna. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg ordered a contingency plan be developed in case Georgia’s newly purchased touchscreen voting machines aren’t fully implemented by 2020. The new machines print a paper record of a voter’s selections. They’ll replace the state’s current outdated machines that don’t produce an auditable paper trail. Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler says she expects Cobb voters to be using the new machines by March, but the paper ballot test is a “fail safe” against any issues.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A federal agency has approved a rail recovery plan submitted by the Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation, officials said. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz said the Federal Transit Administration approved the proposal submitted earlier this year, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The recovery plan was submitted by the city transportation authority to demonstrate Honolulu has a workable proposal for completing the 20-mile rail line. The line was originally estimated at $5.2 billion and was supposed to be completed next year, but the transit administration now projects completion in 2026 at a cost of $9.2 billion. The approval recognizes efforts by the city and state to improve accountability and control costs, Schatz said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: BNSF Railway’s plan to build two bridges as part of a second railroad line in northern Idaho to accommodate increased train traffic and future growth meets environmental requirements, federal officials said Thursday. The U.S. Coast Guard issued a final environmental assessment for the bridges across Lake Pend Oreille and Sand Creek at Sandpoint, finding no significant impact. An environmental group said it was disappointed the Coast Guard didn’t do a much lengthier environmental review called an environmental impact statement, saying an increase in crude oil and other hazardous materials crossing bridges could put the lake and residents at risk. The Coast Guard is involved because the structures are over navigable waters. Idaho officials, who have authority over the lake bottom, have already approved the bridges.\n\nIllinois\n\nDowners Grove: This year’s Illinois Tollway high school art contest will honor the Illinois State Police. Tollway officials announced last week that the winning design will appear on the cover of the 2020 tollway map. The art contest is presented with Blick Art Materials and MB Real Estate. Several Illinois State Police officers have been killed in the line of duty this year. Two died while working on the 294-mile tollway system. Officials say students who enter the contest should “illustrate the service and sacrifice” of state troopers. Artwork could focus on how the state police helps motorists through its principles of integrity, service and pride; how it promotes traffic safety; or how it serves the tollway with motorcycle, K-9 and detective units.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Ball State University will lead archaeological surveys at three state parks to locate possible prehistoric sites and homesteads from the early 1800s. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says those surveys are among 15 projects around the state sharing in about $450,000 in federal grants for historic preservation and archaeology. The archaeology surveys are planned at Summit Lake State Park, the Wilbur Wright Fish and Wildlife Area, and Versailles State Park. About $150,000 was awarded toward the surveys. A variety of other projects received grants, including roof replacement at the former Peru High School gymnasium, which is now the Miami Nation’s tribal headquarters, and repairing the century-old entrance gate at St. Mary of the Woods College near Terre Haute.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Madison: Officials say the Sheaffer Pen Museum has reopened. The museum closed in May last year amid financial concerns and worries about the fate of company archives. The Fort Madison Daily Democrat reports the archives had been on loan from A.T. Cross, Sheaffer’s owner. The museum board president, Tim Gobble, says Cross has agreed to donate virtually all of the company archives to the museum. Grants and other financial pledges of support since have allowed the museum to reopen. Plans are being made for new and refreshed exhibits, as well as video from the company archives. The museum’s regular hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday, Wednesday and Friday or by appointment for larger groups.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The local zoo is beginning a 25-year process of rebuilding and expansion. The Wichita Eagle reports the next few weeks will bring moving day for animals large and small at the Sedgwick County Zoo. The first noticeable change will be the demolition of the second-oldest building at the zoo, a 47-year-old Asian-themed barn with a corrugated steel roof. It will be torn down to make way for a temporary entrance while the main entrance is rebuilt at twice its current size. During the process, a 1,400-pound Zebu bull named Milkdud that’s native to south Asia will be moved in with the Watusi cattle at the African Barn. Plans also are in the works for a new home for the Amur leopards, new office space and a solar-powered train.\n\nKentucky\n\nPikeville: Grants totaling $34.4 million have been announced in an effort to spur economic development and job creation in eastern Kentucky – a region hard-hit by the coal sector’s downturn. Officials say the grants will support projects affecting 14 counties. The support includes nearly $4.8 million for Pikeville Medical Center to develop a children’s hospital and pediatric clinic expected to provide health care services for more than 100,000 children. Leslie County will receive more than $2 million to develop a program expanding internet connectivity and providing job training. U.S. Rep. Harold “Hal” Rogers says grants will help advance health care, enhance tourism, improve infrastructure and create jobs.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The city is closing a historic cemetery in the Garden District for maintenance and repairs. Tours and public visits won’t be allowed until the work is complete at Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. Appointments will be needed for funerals or visits to family tombs. The work starts Monday. A news release says tomb owners can call the property management department for appointments. The area was a separate city, Lafayette, when the cemetery was founded in 1833. Novelist Anne Rice used the cemetery as the setting for her fictional Mayfair witches’ family tomb. Planned work includes fixing a water line, improving drainage, removing and repaving paths, fixing a brick wall and abandoned tombs, removing magnolia trees, and thoroughly cleaning up debris.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state moved ahead Friday with plans to become the first to allow voters to rank candidates in a general presidential election. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said she’ll allow a bill to become law in January without her signature. The legislation requires ranked choice voting in presidential elections and primaries. Ranked voting won’t be used in a planned presidential primary in March 2020, Mills’ office said. The bill won’t go into effect until 90 days after the Legislature is set to adjourn in April. But future presidential primaries would use ranked choice voting, according to the governor’s office. Maine voters in 2016 approved ranked voting, but the system was limited to federal races and primaries.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A two-year project to rehabilitate the westbound span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge that’s expected to cause major delays will be getting underway this month. The Capital Gazette reports some work on the $27 million project was scheduled to start after Labor Day but was delayed. The westbound right lane will now be closed on weekdays starting Sept. 24. Then, starting in October, the right lane will be closed 24/7 through April 16, with restrictions lifted during Thanksgiving. From April 16 through May 20, the westbound right lane will be closed continuously during weekdays. All lanes are expected to be open during next summer’s travel season. The lane closures resume beginning in fall 2020 into spring 2021. The project, fully funded by tolls, is expected to be complete in August 2021.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State transportation officials are restoring 21 historic road markers installed nearly 80 years ago to mark the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Massachusetts Bay Colony because they’ve grown weather-beaten over the decades. The cast iron markers, originally installed in 1930, feature black lettering and trim, plus the state’s coat of arms in blue and gold. They describe historic events and figures and provide facts and stories about their communities. All of the markers are 36 inches wide, between 35 and 45 inches high, and 165 to 200 pounds. The state Transportation Department says the markers being restored are in Bernardston, Brimfield, Deerfield, Greenfield, Hadley, Hatfield, New Braintree, Northfield, West Brookfield and Worcester. The project is expected to be completed this winter.\n\nMichigan\n\nIsle Royale: The second year of the National Park Service’s wolf relocation project has kicked off with a capture of a wolf on the state’s mainland and a flight to Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Mlive reports the 70-pound male that’s believed to be about 3 years old was captured last week. The wolf that was flown by seaplane joins 14 others already on Isle Royale, and officials hope to ultimately bring as many as 30 new wolves to the island that’s been overrun by more than 2,000 moose. Officials hope the new predators will be able to reduce the number of the leaf-eating moose before the latter eat their way through the island located about 60 miles northwest of the Upper Peninsula.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz has finally made good on a long-held campaign promise. After “eight months of negotiations and dealmaking,” he signed off on adopting a new dog for the family. Scout is a 3-month-old black lab mix the Walzes adopted from Midwest Animal Rescue in the metro area. The governor said he had in March 2017 promised son Gus a dog if he won the 2018 election. Walz said his promise wasn’t brought up during the campaign trail, but Gus reminded Walz about the dog on election night once it became clear Walz would prevail. Scout comes as a bit of a surprise, as it wasn’t certain whether the Walzes would get a dog. Walz’s wife, Gwen, said Walz made that promise to Gus without consulting her first. And some of Walz’s family are allergic to certain dog breeds, to say nothing of how other pets would view a dog. “Afton the cat has not been happy,” Walz said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is considering new rules that let companies continue to use food-labeling terms such as “veggie burger” and “vegan bacon,” as long as the terms are prominently displayed so consumers understand the products are not meat. The state agriculture department on Thursday proposed new regulations for plant-based products that are sold as alternatives to meat. The regulations came in response to a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit organization advocating plant-based foods and an Illinois food company. The lawsuit was filed July 1, the same day the state enacted a law saying that “a plant-based or insect-based food product shall not be labeled as meat or a meat food product.” Meat producers have been trying to protect meat terminology by pushing for state laws that restrict labeling of products such as meatless meatballs.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Critics say a loophole in a new law meant to ensure the safety of children in unlicensed child care homes has caused some children to be pushed out of licensed facilities. Before the law took effect Aug. 28, unlicensed, in-home child care providers could care for four or fewer unrelated children and an unlimited number of their own children. Under the new law, unlicensed providers may care for only six children, and no more than three under age 2. Day care operators’ children over age 5 are excluded in the count. The Columbia Missourian reports lawmakers inadvertently required licensed day care providers to count all their own children, regardless of age. That discrepancy has forced some licensed day care providers to refuse spots for unrelated children. A waiver process for licensed providers for their children over 5 is being used on a case-by-case basis to fix the loophole.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State health officials are proposing new rules to regulate medical marijuana testing laboratories. A notice issued Friday by the state Department of Public Health and Human Services says a hearing will be held on the proposed rules Sept. 26 at its offices in Helena. The health department drafted the regulations after state lawmakers earlier this year put the agency’s state laboratory in charge of licensing and inspecting the marijuana testing labs. The proposal would set new rules by which the labs are licensed and accredited and how they operate. Existing licensing and accreditation regulations would be repealed. State law requires medical marijuana providers to test their products in a licensed lab for quality assurance before they can be sold.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials have unveiled a blue, 300-pound bronze statue of a troll that now sits below the popular Bob Kerrey Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Missouri River from Omaha to Council Bluffs, Iowa. Omar the Troll – short for Omaha Metro Area River – was introduced during a news conference Wednesday. The 4-foot troll with a toothy grin now greets visitors from atop a concrete cottage set up on a mulched area by one of the bridge’s pillars. The sculpture is the brainchild of tourism group Visit Omaha and has been in the works for three years. The idea behind his creation is to keep visitors excited about the riverfront bridge. Deborah Ward with Visit Omaha tells the Omaha World-Herald that “every bridge needs a troll.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A preservation group plans to use a grant to redevelop and preserve a historically black community. The Westside neighborhood, virtually the only area of the city where African Americans were permitted to live in the 1940s, saw hundreds of homes razed and thousands of people displaced, with residents not compensated for their destroyed dwellings, the Las Vegas Sun reports. Some vacant lots in the neighborhood just blocks northwest of downtown still date to that ugly period, says Heidi Swank, executive director of the Nevada Preservation Foundation. The foundation plans to use a $50,000 grant from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to identify and highlight Westside stories of triumph, innovation and success. Frank Woodbeck, a foundation board member, says that unlike in traditional redevelopment, the foundation aims to keep people in the neighborhood or even bring back former residents.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLincoln: This year’s New Hampshire Highland Games is hosting the World Championship in Heavy Athletics, where athletes from seven countries will compete in traditional Scottish events to test strength and agility. The competition will feature the stone throw, hammer throw and caber toss. The games are scheduled for Sept. 20-22 at the Loon Mountain Resort in Lincoln. Chuck Kasson, the reigning world champion and winner of the 2018 New Hampshire Highland Games, is among those scheduled to compete. Also featured will be a performance of the bagpipe band The Red Hot Chili Pipers on Sept. 21.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDeptford: A cornstalk that was planted by accident has now shattered a Guinness world record. The record belongs to Matt Jacovelli, a Deptford retiree who noticed the unusually abundant cornstalk over the summer. “I started counting and got up to 12, 13 and 14 cobs and couldn’t believe it,” he said. The final tally was 29 cobs, verified by Rutgers agricultural agent Michelle Infante-Casella on Aug. 30. Jacovelli submitted the official count to Guinness and received a quick ruling. On Thursday, he learned he now holds the Guinness record for “most corn cobs on a single plant.” The previous world record was held by another place known for corn: Iowa. But Jacovelli nearly doubled that 2009 record, which was for 16 cobs. A typical cornstalk yields two cobs.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nWhite Sands Missile Range: White Sands Missile Range in southern New Mexico has scheduled an Oct. 5 open house at Trinity Site, the second of two such events planned this year. Trinity Site is where the world’s first atomic bomb was detonated July 16, 1945. Range officials said the open house is free, and no reservations are required. Entry will be allowed from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Visitors can walk to ground zero, where a small obelisk marks the spot where the bomb was detonated. Historical photos are mounted on the fence surrounding the area. Visitors can also ride a shuttle bus to travel the 2 miles from ground zero to ranch houses where scientists assembled the bomb’s plutonium core.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The state has a new license plate that features several famous landmarks. The Department of Motor Vehicles announced the design Friday based on the results of a statewide survey. The winning plate showcases iconic settings like the Statue of Liberty, Niagara Falls and the Montauk Lighthouse. It also features the state motto “Excelsior,” a Latin word meaning “ever upward,” and a blue-and-yellow color scheme on a white background. DMV Commissioner Mark Schroeder says some 325,000 New Yorkers participated in the survey. About half of them selected the winning design over four other options. He said the design represents “what the Empire State is all about– our diversity, our unparalleled architecture and natural beauty.” The new license plate costs $25 and will be available to motorists in April.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s Historic Preservation Office has set up an online form so local governments and residents can report damage to historic properties caused by Hurricane Dorian. The office wants information about wind and flooding to historic structures, cemeteries and state highway historical markers. With that information in hand, the office can offer aid, technical expertise, and consultation with federal and state entities. The Historic Preservation Office offers technical advice and consultation for the restoration of damaged historic properties at no charge. A building must be at least 45 years old, but it doesn’t have to have any special historic designation. In addition, the office’s website offers tips for drying out flooded buildings, documenting damage for insurance purposes and other technical advice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities relying on DNA collected from a cigarette butt have charged a man with engaging in a riot for his involvement in a Dakota Access pipeline protest three years ago. The Bismarck Tribune reports Morton County prosecutors also charged 23-year-old Lawrence Malcolm Jr. with felony conspiracy to commit criminal mischief. An arrest warrant was issued Thursday. The charges relate to a Sept. 6, 2016, protest on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. An affidavit says more than 100 demonstrators, many with their faces covered, halted construction and vandalized equipment. North Dakota crime lab officials notified investigators last month that DNA from a cigarette butt found at the scene was a match for Malcolm, whose DNA profile was on file from an earlier arrest.\n\nOhio\n\nSharonville: A man confused about state drug laws has called a police department demanding that officers return the small amount of marijuana they “stole” from him. WXIX-TV reports the man told a Sharonville police dispatcher in an expletive-laced call Tuesday that it’s legal to possess 100 grams of marijuana, and the amount officers seized was just 4 grams. Sharonville police posted a recording of the call on their Facebook page. The suburban Cincinnati department wryly noted: “People may be a bit in the weeds, so we would like to take this opportunity to clear the haze.” While some Ohio cities have decriminalized pot possession, it remains illegal in the state. Sharonville police said they “don’t make the rules” but must uphold them.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPerry: Hundreds of strangers have honored a 97-year-old World War II veteran who funeral home officials say died with no known surviving family. Motorcycles carrying U.S. flags were part of Wednesday’s service for Herman White, who died Aug. 11. White was buried next to his wife and son in Perry, 60 miles north of Oklahoma City. Funeral director Rebecca Raines, with Brown-Dugger Funeral Home, reached out to the community after learning White had no known surviving relatives. White married in 1941, joined the Navy in 1945 and served aboard the USS Muliphen in the Pacific. After the military, White returned to Oklahoma and worked in the oil and gas fields. The couple had a son in 1951. White’s wife died in 1998. Their son died in 1999.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities being attacked and locked up in isolation – this is what some kids from Oregon were subjected to after being sent to out-of-state facilities because of a lack of services in their home state. After investigations revealed deplorable conditions, Oregon is now bringing them back. A state senator at the forefront in the effort says it is critically important for Oregon to provide mental health services. Sen. Sara Gelser, a Democrat from Corvallis, says the Oregon Department of Human Services planned to have 120 children in out-of-state placements by the end of June. Instead, 37 children are in out-of-state facilities, down from as many as 88. Gelser said she wants the number at zero and for strong programs to be built in Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will receive another $75 million in federal aid to fight the opioid-addiction crisis, money that Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration says will help with treatment, prevention and education. Wolf’s administration said Friday that about $56 million will go to the Department of Drug and Alcohol Programs. The money will also help extend programs designed to help people in addiction treatment find stable housing and to attract treatment professionals by helping repay their education loans. The state Department of Health received $8.4 million, a grant that is expected to repeat each of the next two years, while Philadelphia received $5.9 million, and Allegheny County received $5.2 million.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The organization that oversees high school sports in the state is asking overzealous parents to settle down because they are driving away qualified game officials. The executive director of the Rhode Island Interscholastic League tells WJAR-TV the primary reason the state has a shortage of referees and umpires is that officials don’t want to put up with obnoxious parents. In a letter to parents of high school athletes, Tom Mezzanotte wrote: “Yelling, screaming and berating the officials humiliates your child, annoys those sitting around you” and “embarrasses your child’s school.” He says the shortage of officials results in games being rescheduled, postponed or canceled. Softball umpire Susan Johnson says an angry parent drove toward a colleague’s car after a game before swerving away at the last second.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An upstate school district has started work on a new $15 million building at its science center. WSPA-TV reports the Greenville County school district is constructing a building that will house exhibits on the water cycle and sustainable living, plus a cafeteria and several classrooms. The building is supposed to be complete in fall 2020 and replaces an unused outdoor amphitheater. The science center is owned by the school district, which is providing $12 million in funding. The Roper Mountain Science Center Association has raised the other $3 million privately. Exhibits were designed in collaboration with the Shi Center for Sustainability. The science center already has an observatory, planetarium, living history farm and other exhibit buildings.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPine Ridge: The Oglala Sioux Tribe has passed legislation aimed at hate crimes on the Pine Ridge reservation. The Rapid City Journal reports the law passed by the tribal council Wednesday makes hate crimes punishable with up to one year in jail, which is the maximum allowed under tribal law. The law defines a hate crime as one where the defendant intentionally targets a victim or property because of the actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability of any person. The law comes two months after the tribe legalized same-sex marriage on the reservation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A priest who banned Harry Potter books from a Catholic school’s library was accused by parents of causing their children psychological and spiritual harm. A 2017 letter from 14 St. Edward Catholic School parents urged the Nashville diocese to remove the Rev. Dan Reehil. The letter, with 50 bullet points, said Reehil is a toxic narcissist who hates Pope Francis and views himself as “a soldier of God.” It said: “Our school, however, consists of children, not soldiers.” Diocesan spokesman Rick Musacchio said Reehil’s views, like that of the retired, more liberal pastor he replaced, both have homes in the church. Reehil didn’t respond to the Tennessean’s interview requests. In an email, he said he removed J.K. Rowling’s books because they contain “actual spells and curses.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal judge is expressing frustration that officials don’t seem to be honoring a settlement of a lawsuit over oppressive heat at some state prison facilities. During a court hearing Friday in Houston, U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison debated whether officials should be sanctioned by having them experience the same temperatures as inmates. Ellison delayed a ruling on possible sanctions until he’s heard from officials, including prison wardens, at a hearing Tuesday. Last year’s settlement resolved a lawsuit filed in 2014 over temperatures at the Wallace Pack Unit, about 95 miles northwest of Houston. Attorneys for the inmates say prison officials are not adhering to the settlement. A lawyer with the Texas Attorney General’s Office told Ellison officials are working to fix problems affecting the prisoners.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Conservative groups in the state have addressed school officials to disapprove of a new teacher instructional guide for sex education. The Deseret News reports Utah Eagle Forum was one of many groups that addressed the state Board of Education on Thursday criticizing the changes. Board officials say instructional guides were created addressing specific topics including sex education after new K-12 health standards were passed in April. Officials say teachers are now allowed to respond to student questions to provide medically accurate data and clarify or correct misinformation. Officials say the guide does not allow teachers to answer technique or how-to questions. Some parents say teachers should be encouraging students to speak to their parents, nurses or counselors and not expose other students to these types of questions or their answers.\n\nVermont\n\nStrafford: A river poisoned by a mine that dates to the United States’ early days is looking good two decades after cleanup began. Contractors working for the Environmental Protection Agency as part of the federal Superfund program are doing final work on the Elizabeth Mine in Strafford before turning it over to the state for long-term monitoring. The mine was once important enough to the economy of the young country that President James Monroe visited in 1817. It stayed in business for decades, feeding industrial, electrification and war efforts before closing in 1958. For decades, acid- and metal-contaminated water from the waste piles near the abandoned mine left local waterways almost dead. Now after the estimated $90 million cleanup, the state has changed the designation of the Ompompanoosuc River. It now supports aquatic life.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Three couples planning to get married have filed a federal lawsuit challenging a state requirement that they disclose their race on their marriage application. Lawyer Victor Glasberg says that the requirement is a vestige of Jim Crow laws and that Virginia is one of only eight states requiring marriage applicants to disclose their race. According to the lawsuit, one Virginia county provided a list of more than 200 potential races to a couple who questioned the requirement. It included “American,” “Aryan,” “Moor” and “Mulatto.” A spokesman for Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that the office will examine the complaint closely and determine how to proceed. Glasberg says he does not think Herring should defend the law.\n\nWashington\n\nColfax: The work of plowing, planting and harvesting is still done the old-fashioned way with teams of draft horses and mules on a parcel of farmland in eastern Washington. On Labor Day, several hundred spectators watched an annual, public demonstration of those methods near Colfax. A combine header pushed by a team of six Percheron draft mules fed cut grain into vintage wagons, each pulled by a pair of horses, as several acres of barley were harvested. Volunteers with the Palouse Empire Threshing Bee Association, a group dedicated to preserving the way land was farmed decades ago, took time away from their own harvest work to bring in the barley. Stan Riebold, a longtime member of the group, said it plans to continue preserving the old way of doing things.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The city has approved an ordinance that would regulate a needle exchange run by the local health department. News outlets report the Clarksburg City Council voted Thursday to approve the final reading of the proposal, which would require those receiving needles to meet requirements that include submitting to blood tests and showing photo identification. Health department administrator Chad Bundy had expressed concerns with some of the ordinance’s provisions, including the photo ID requirement and limiting the program to Harrison County residents. City Attorney James Cann said prior to the meeting that he had reviewed the ordinance and found no legal problems. Clarksburg Mayor Ryan Kennedy has said the needle exchange program is “creating some negatives,” and officials want to eliminate those “while still retaining some positives.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Organizers say a campaign to encourage Midwestern millennials to move to the Badger State will continue despite a lack of funding from this year’s state budget. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers declined to grant the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.’s request for $10 million over the next two years. The campaign that began in early 2018 was the brainchild of Evers’ Republican predecessor, Scott Walker. Wisconsin Public Radio reports WEDC officials say the organization has identified $4 million within its budget to fund the program this year and expects to do the same in 2020-21. Evers’ spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, says he is focused on developing infrastructure and communities to attract and retain a talented workforce. The campaign aims to attract workers ages 21 to 35 in science, technology, health care and financial services.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to honor the Black 14 after they were cut from the school’s football team for wanting to protest during the civil rights movement. The Casper Star-Tribune reports 14 student-athletes were dismissed for wanting to wear black armbands during a 1969 game against BYU in protest of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ then-policy barring black men from the priesthood. Athletic officials say nine of the living 11 members are expected back this week for the scheduled tribute. Officials say the weeklong commemoration includes a plaque presentation, football halftime recognition and a free public panel discussion. It could be the largest known contingent of the Black 14 on campus since they were dismissed 50 years ago.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/09"}]}

Ron DeSantis on Monday signed sweeping social media restrictions into law also requiring age verification to access pornographic websites in his state.\n\nIf it survives expected lawsuits from the nation's largest tech companies, the measure would take effect at the beginning of 2025. In that case, minors under 16 would be barred from social media platforms, unless they're 14- or 15-year-olds who get a parent's permission.\n\n\"You can have a kid in the house safe, seemingly, and then you have predators that can get right in there into your own home,\" DeSantis said at a press conference in Jacksonville. \"You could be doing everything right but they know how to get and manipulate these different platforms.\"\n\nThe state could join several others with age-verification requirement laws that have led Pornhub to block user access in at least six states.\n\nLaw backed by school officials, House Speaker\n\nDeSantis was joined by local school officials and bill sponsors, as well as state Attorney General Ashley Moody and Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr., all of whom back the new policy.\n\nAlso there was Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast, who negotiated with DeSantis on the legislation (HB 3) after the governor vetoed the original version, citing legal and parents' rights concerns.\n\nThe legislation passed both legislative chambers by a broad bipartisan basis, with only a fraction of Democrats dissenting, claiming it was government overreach that would be overturned in the courts. First Amendment advocacy organizations have also come out against the measure, saying largely the same.\n\nDeSantis says policy aligns with First Amendment\n\nDeSantis and Renner said they believe the measure will survive judicial scrutiny.\n\n\"What's unique in this bill is we didn't focus on content,\" Renner said. \"You will not find a line in this bill that addresses good speech or bad speech because that would violate the First Amendment ... But what we have addressed is the addictive features that are at the heart of why children stay on these platforms for hours and hours on end.\"\n\nThe bills defines the affected social media platforms as ones with features such as push notifications and infinite scrolling, which loads content as the user scrolls down, eliminating the need to click to a next page. Those features have had an \"devastating effect\" on the mental health of children, Renner said.\n\nHere's what happens next:Does the social media bill affect Instagram and TikTok?\n\nTech trade group files lawsuit against measure\n\nRenner predicted an imminent legal challenge from NetChoice, a tech industry trade group that has filed lawsuits in other states against similar measures and has opposed Florida's.\n\nIn a statement shared shortly after the signing, the group called the restrictions unconstitutional.\n\n“An unconstitutional law will protect exactly zero Floridians,\" said Carl Szabo, NetChoice's vice president and general counsel. \"HB 3 is also bad policy because of the data collection on Floridians by online services it will in effect require. This will put their private data at risk of breach.\n\n“HB 3 forces Floridians to hand over sensitive personal information to websites or lose their access to critical information channels,\" he continued. \"This infringes on Floridians’ First Amendment rights to share and access speech online.”\n\nFlorida joins eight states with age-verification laws\n\nFlorida has joined seven other states in blocking millions of people from accessing Pornhub’s adult video site unless they can prove they are at least 18 years old.\n\nLast June, Texas passed HB 1181 requiring companies that feature “sexual material harmful to minors” to verify their age with proof of government-issued identification or another system that uses public and private data.\n\nLouisiana was the first to pass an age-verification requirement law but other states include Arkansas, Utah, Montana, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia.\n\n\"So far, six other states have copied this (Louisiana) bill but minor changes have been made to the text, which can have big implications for systems designed to achieve compliance,\" reads a post from the Age Verification Providers Association, the nonprofit global trade body representing 26 organizations who provide \"age assurance solutions.\"\n\nAdvocates say laws restrict sites for adults, too\n\nWith more states passing similar legislation, attorneys and advocates for porn sites have argued that the laws also prohibit adult access. Pornhub has completely disabled website access in Texas, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Montana, North Carolina because of age-verification requirement laws. The company said it had no choice in order to reduce the risk of hefty fines and penalties.\n\nLast year the Free Speech Coalition, a national advocacy organization for the First Amendment rights of adult businesses, filed a lawsuit in federal court in Utah over what it called an “anti-porn ban.”\n\n“We are fighting not only for the rights of our members and the larger adult entertainment community, but for the right of all Americans to access constitutionally protected expression in the privacy of their own home,\" Executive Director Alison Boden said.\n\nIn February, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Pornhub’s parent company, Aylo, in an effort to force them to comply with HB 1181. The Republican threatened Aylo with millions of dollars in civil penalties\n\n“Texas has a right to protect its children from the detrimental effects of pornographic content,” Paxton said when announcing the lawsuit. “I look forward to holding any company accountable that violates our age verification laws intended to prevent minors from being exposed to harmful, obscene material on the internet.”\n\nContributing: Jonathan Limehouse and Kayla Jimenez", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/01/26/florida-hb1-restricts-teens-under-16-social-media-sites-read-bill-parental-consent-facebook-x-tiktok/72364026007/", "title": "Florida HB 1 restricts teens under 16 social media sites. Read bill", "text": "In a 106-13 vote, the Florida House voted Wednesday on a bill that would ban social media use for minors under the age of 16.\n\nKnown as HB 1, the bill would require social media platforms to prohibit minors from creating new accounts, terminate existing accounts of those younger than 16, and use age verification for account holders, without a parental permission exemption.\n\nWhat it doesn't do is define what social media accounts would be covered under the bill.\n\nThe bill is now heading to the Florida Senate. If it passes, it will go before Gov. Ron DeSantis to be signed into law.\n\n'Environmental toxin': Florida isn't first state to try to restrict social media use by minors\n\nThree other states — Ohio, Arkansas and Utah — have tried to restrict minors on social media.\n\nOhio's Social Media Parental Notification Act would have prohibited social media use for teens under 16 without parental consent. It's been blocked by a federal judge.\n\nArkansas' proposal also would have required parental consent for minors to sign up for social media accounts. NetChoice, a trade organization with several social media companies as members, sued the state for violating the First Amendment.\n\nUtah's bill goes beyond requiring parental consent by trying to keep teens offline between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. It also faces lawsuits from NetChoice and The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.\n\nCalifornia is in its own legal battle with NetChoice over a law intended to safeguard children online.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the city of New York officially designated social media an \"environmental toxin,\" saying \"all New Yorkers should advocate to hold social media companies accountable and advance reform that protects youth from harmful and predatory practices.\"\n\nRead HB 1 on social media use for minors\n\n5 key points about Florida HB 1 social media restrictions\n\nSocial media platforms would prohibit minors younger than 16 from creating a new account on social media. Social media platforms would have to use \"reasonable\" age verification methods to verify the age of each account holder on a social media platform when a new account is created. Social media platforms would be required to terminate any account reasonably known to be held by a minor younger than 16 and provide users with 90 days to dispute a termination. Minors who aren't eligible to have a social media account can request to terminate it. Parents or guardians also can request to terminate a minor's account. Social media platforms will be required to delete all personal information relating to terminated accounts unless there are legal reasons to maintain such information.\n\nWhat does Florida consider a social media platform?\n\nSupporters of HB 1 won't say what sites would be covered under the bill.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into specific companies,\" said Republican Rep. Tyler Sirois of Merritt Island, a bill sponsor. \"Our bill is focused on features.\"\n\n\"If the social media platform falls under any of the things we have identified, then obviously they would be subject to this law,\" said Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, another sponsor who help craft the bill.\n\nAn amendment to the bill clarified that it would apply to any service that:\n\nUtilizes addictive, harmful, or deceptive design features, or any other feature that is designed to cause an account holder to have an excessive or compulsive need to use or engage with the social media platform.\n\nAllows an account holder to interact with or track other account holders.\n\nAllows the utilization of information derived from the social media platform's tracking of the activity of an account holder to control or target at least part of the content offered to the account holder.\n\nDeSantis has tackled social media on other occasions\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis barred the use of TikTok on government and school servers across the state in 2023 to curb \"the influence\" of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBefore he withdrew as a presidential candidate, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also said he would consider a national TikTok ban if elected.\n\n“I am inclined to not want TikTok in the United States,” the Florida governor told The Wall Street Journal. “I think it’s creating a security vulnerability for us. I think they are mining a lot of data.”\n\nFlorida's Digital Bill of Rights\n\nIn June 2023, DeSantis signed legislation to create a Digital Bill of Rights. The bill includes:\n\nThe right to control personal data, including the right to confirm, access, and delete your personal data from a social platform;\n\nThe right to know that your personal data will not be used against you when purchasing a home, obtaining health insurance, or being hired;\n\nThe right to know how internet search engines manipulate search results;\n\nThe right to opt out of having personal data sold; and\n\nThe right to protect children from personal data collection.\n\nContributors: Kinsey Crowley, Douglas Soule, C.

It stands out among similar bills introduced around the country as it does not allow for exemptions with parental permission. It passed the House with bipartisan support in January.\n\nA slightly modified HB 1 passed the Senate with a 23-14 vote Thursday morning, with five Republicans breaking from the majority to oppose the bill and two Democrats voting in favor.\n\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis said the modifications, which sought to clarify how the law would define social media and make age verification process more private, were not quite enough. The House voted again in favor to approve the revisions later that day anyways, sending it to the Governor's deck.\n\n\"Parents need to have a role in this,\" DeSantis said at a press conference Thursday afternoon. \"I do think parents are concerned about social media and what goes on there, and I do think they think it's a problem.

However, the bill remained mostly intact as it moved through the legislature.\n\nSenators tweaked the definition of social media platform, so that affected ones must in part have \"addictive features,\" including infinite scrolling, push notifications and auto-play videos.\n\nAnother change to the legislation, OK'd Wednesday, requires social media and pornographic platforms to offer an anonymous age-verification option to users by third-party services, which aren't allowed to retain personal identifying information.\n\n95% of teens between 13 and 17 use social media\n\nSocial media has become nearly ubiquitous among youth. The 2023 U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory on Social Media and Youth Mental Health found that nearly 95% of youth aged 13 to 17 use a social media platform, with more than a third saying they use it \"almost constantly.\"\n\nThe advisory concluded that more research is needed to fully understand the impacts of social media. But current research shows there are some benefits and \"ample indicators that social media can also have a profound risk of harm to the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.\"\n\nPotential benefits identified in the advisory were community, connection and self expression. It also stated that social media can support mental health of LGBTQ youth to help develop their identities. Additionally, seven out of 10 girls of color reported encountering identity-affirming content related to race on social media, the advisory stated.\n\nPotential harms of using social media included greater risk of suffering from depression and anxiety. Some studies also showed greater risk of negative health outcomes for adolescents girls including disordered eating and poor sleep.\n\nOhio, Utah measures restricting minor's social media use stalled by lawsuits\n\nFlorida isn't the first state to attempt to limit social media access for youth. Here are some other states' bills and how they got held up:\n\nOhio - The Social Media Parental Notification Act would have prohibited social media use for teens under 16 without parental consent. It was blocked by a federal judge after NetChoice, a trade organization with several social media companies as members, challenged the constitutionality of the law.\n\n- The Social Media Parental Notification Act would have prohibited social media use for teens under 16 without parental consent.

Utah - In addition to requiring parental consent for minors to use social media, the Utah law also aims to keep teens offline between 10:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. It was slated to go into effect in March, but that was pushed back to Oct. 1 as it faces lawsuits from NetChoice and digital rights group The Electronic Frontier Foundation. Lawmakers have introduced additional bills trying to limit social media for teens in the 2024 legislative session.\n\nCalifornia is also in a legal battle with NetChoice on a multifaceted law intended to safeguard children online.\n\nMeta opposes HB1 and NetChoice calls it 'unconstitutional'\n\nStill, Facebook's parent company Meta has been opposed to the legislation. In a letter to the House's Judiciary Committee for the original bill, the company argued it undercut parents' ability to make their own decisions about their kid's social media use and raises data privacy concerns.\n\n\"While our company recognizes the goals of House Bill 1, we believe this bill, as currently drafted, not only fails to empower parents to make the decision regarding whether their teen may use a social media platform but also fails to create robust, industry-wide standards that help parents and teens manage their online activity,\" the letter penned by Meta's Southeast public policy manager Caulder Harvill-Childs states.\n\nMeta spokesperson Rachel Holland said in an emailed statement Friday that HB 1 needs to provide clear rules for parents.\n\n\"Teens move fluidly across online services and youth online safety bills that hold different services to different standards in different states will subject teens to inconsistent protections online,\" said Holland.\n\nNetChoice's vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo previously called the bill \"unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"If enacted, it will jeopardize the privacy and security of Floridians who use the internet,\" Szabo said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY in January. \"The Free State of Florida deserves better than a massive, unconstitutional internet surveillance program.”\n\nTheir stance hasn't changed with the amendments to the bill as it heads to the governor's desk. \"We appreciate the changes to HB 1, but while the bill is less unconstitutional, it is still unconstitutional,\" Szabo wrote Thursday.\n\nContributing: Brandon Girod, Emilee Coblentz; USA TODAY Network", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/tech/social-media-lawsuits-teen-suicide/index.html", "title": "Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be at risk: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3. Call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). 4. Take the person to an emergency room or seek help from a medical or mental health professional.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/state/2024/03/18/pornhub-blocks-states-with-new-age-verification-laws-is-florida-next/73014384007/", "title": "Pornhub blocks states with new age verification laws. Is Florida next?", "text": "Texans have been kicked off of one of the most-visited adult sites in the world, joining millions of disappointed residents of several other states that have all passed adult-site ID requirements.\n\nWill Florida be next?\n\nThe Florida Legislature passed its own age verification rule this month as part of a social media bill to restrict children from social media. Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed it, asking for more parental control in the social media part, and the revised bill passed at the end of the legislative session.\n\nWhat is Pornhub?\n\nPornhub is a site that offers free access to a vast library of explicit adult movies and clips broken down into categories. It was the 13th most-visited website in the world as of March 1 and the second-most visited adult website.\n\nThe site allows professional companies, porn stars and amateurs alike to upload their material, create fan clubs, and charge for premium content. Pornhub is owned by Aylo, recently renamed from Mindgeek, along with several other popular adult sites.\n\nAside from attacks from anti-porn groups, the company is also under fire for allowing anyone to upload anything, which drove many smaller adult movie companies out of business and also brought complaints about a surge of uploads showing revenge porn, child sexual abuse material and copyrighted movies. In December 2020, after a New York Times expose of non-consensual pornography and sex trafficking on the site, Pornhub deleted over 6 million videos and began allowing uploads only from verified users.\n\nWhy are states passing age-verification laws for adult websites?\n\nChild safety advocates and state legislators argue that more needs to be done to keep children safe online and away from adult material. Age verification laws force adult sites to require some form of official ID verifying users are 18 or over before they're allowed to access the site's wares.\n\nThe laws levy hefty fees for noncompliance and leave the door open for punishing civil charges.\n\nFree speech advocates and adult entertainment lobbyists say the laws are hurting adults who have the right to access such content and warn that the definition of \"adult material\" can be weaponized.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we’ve already seen how this designation has been weaponized to censor and ban LGBTQ+ literature, reproductive rights resources, sex education, art, and healthcare,\" said a statement from the Free Speech Coalition, which has sued Texas over the new law. \"Sexual expression, online and off, has been and continues to be the canary in the coal mine of free speech.\"\n\nWhy does Pornhub block states instead of complying with age verification rules?\n\nPornhub has offered several reasons why it simply bans traffic from states with age verification rules rather than complying. According to the message on the site that's currently all anyone from Texas can see:\n\nTexas' new law is the \"least effective and yet also most restrictive means of accomplishing Texas’s stated purpose of allegedly protecting minors.\"\n\nSuch laws drive users from sites that comply to the thousands of websites that don't, many of them with far fewer safety measures in place.\n\nSuch laws reduce content creators' ability to \"post and distribute legal adult content and directly impact their ability to share the artistic messages they want to convey with it.\"\n\nWhile the Pornhub block reduces the ease of access, anyone with a VPN — a service that allows you to hide your computer's address and route you through locations you choose, including other states or countries, a useful security measure when using your computer on public WiFi networks — can easily bypass the bans.\n\nIs Pornhub blocked in Florida?\n\nNot yet.\n\nIs Florida going to ban Pornhub?\n\nIf DeSantis signs HB 3 and it is not challenged in court, any adult website visible in Florida \"must use either anonymous age verification or standard age verification to verify that the age of a person attempting to access the material is 18 years of age or older and prevent access to the material by a person younger than 18 years of age.\"\n\nIt has to offer both verification options but does not offer details about what the \"anonymous age verification\" would look like, and it requires that age verification be done by a third party that does not keep identifying information.\n\nWill Pornhub block Florida residents?\n\nPornhub said through a spokesperson that they declined to \"discuss the hypothetical scenario.\"\n\nBut Aylo previously told the USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida that such laws also create data privacy issues.\n\n“Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy,\" a spokesperson said in a late January email, when Florida's legislation had just started moving through the Capitol.\n\nThe company said the “only” solution is to require “age verification at the source: on the device.”\n\nWhen will Florida's adult site age verification requirement begin?\n\nIf DeSantis signs HB 3 and it is not challenged in court, the age verification requirement begins Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nWhich states can no longer access Pornhub?\n\nPornhub is currently restricting access to people from Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia.\n\nContributing: Douglas Soule, USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/18/iowa-poll-book-ban-law-for-public-schools-goes-too-far/73015525007/", "title": "Iowa Poll: Half say new book ban law for public schools goes too far", "text": "© Copyright 2024, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.\n\nHalf of Iowans believe the state’s new book ban law — which has resulted in the removal of more than a thousand books from public schools — goes too far, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll finds, while a third view the law and subsequent removals as “about right.”\n\nThirteen percent believe “this does not go far enough,” and 3% aren’t sure.\n\nIn May 2023, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed Senate File 496, a sweeping education law that bans nearly all books depicting sex acts from public schools, among other changes. The law exempts religious books.\n\nThe Iowa Poll asked respondents to give their opinion on “Iowa’s new law requiring schools to ban books depicting sex acts,” which “has resulted in the removal of more than 1,300 books from Iowa public schools.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe Des Moines Register documented more than 1,300 book removals from public schools due to the law by mid-February, when the poll question was written.\n\nThe Register is now aware of about 1,820 books — 615 of which are unique titles — removed from schools since the law went into effect July 1.\n\nA federal judge has since blocked the state from enforcing the book ban as two lawsuits work their way through the courts\n\nThe poll of 804 Iowa adults was conducted by Selzer & Co. Feb. 25-28 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nMichelle Leaverton, of Urbandale, a poll respondent who agreed to a follow-up interview, described banning books as “absurd.”\n\nThe 51-year-old Democrat said depriving children of the ability to make choices about what they read and of perspectives they may see reflected in their own lives is damaging — including for her own children who identify as LGBTQ.\n\nLeaverton said she is shocked by the lists of classic novels that have been removed from schools, such as “1984” and “Animal Farm” by George Orwell, and feels the law is further marginalizing LGBTQ and other underrepresented voices\n\nIowans with children under the age of 18 show more support for the law and book removals: 39% say this goes too far, 40% say this is about right, and 16% say this does not go far enough. Five percent of parents with children are not sure.\n\nIndependent voter Tracy Alberts of Cedar Rapids, 45, a poll respondent who agreed to a follow-up interview, feels the ban does not go far enough.\n\n“I think parents should be put in charge of what is in the school's library and what is applicable for the grade level,” said the mother of three.\n\nOutside of history, schools should allow books only on topics that a person can safely discuss in an office— meaning sexual content and politics do not have a place in schools, said Alberts, who works in human resources.\n\nViews on book ban, removals divide by political party, gender\n\nA large majority of Democrats (75%) and most independents (55%) view the book ban and removals as going too far. The plurality of Republicans (44%) see this situation as about right. Almost a quarter of Republicans (23%) say this does not go far enough.\n\nThe poll also shows a large gap by gender: 60% of women feel the law and book removals have gone too far, while 41% of men feel that way.\n\nRepublican Steven Davies of Corning, 54, feels the ban is about right for his family, but he has mixed emotions about outright banning of books for other students.\n\n“Do I think that certain books in school shouldn't be in there?” Davies said. “Absolutely.”\n\nHe believes literature that’s sexual in nature should not be in schools and pointed to the LGBTQ memoir “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe. Iowa Republican lawmakers have targeted the visual novel, which traces the author’s journey with gender and sexuality through adolescence and adulthood, for its candid sexual images and scenes.\n\n“I also acknowledge it is a slippery slope, because where does it end?” Davies said. “And who’s going to be the judge and jury of what gets banned?”\n\nIowa’s book ban law follows high-profile challenges over sexual content\n\nHigh-profile attempts to restrict or remove books from schools popped up in the Des Moines metro and around the country in recent years as some residents challenged books that they felt were inappropriate for students. The divisive issue turned politically potent, and Iowa legislators took notice.\n\nThe Des Moines Register documented 99 challenges to 60 books from August 2020 to May 2023, before Reynolds signed the book ban law. Nearly 90 percent of Iowa school districts had no challenges in that time frame.\n\nAbout three-quarters of challenges ended with retaining the book without restrictions.\n\nAbout 76% of challenges that gave specific reasons were due to books’ sexual content, while about 26% cited profanity and 14% involved violence. (More than one reason was sometimes cited.)\n\nThe most-challenged books before the book ban passed were LGBTQ coming-of-age memoirs “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe and “All Boys Aren’t Blue” by George M. Johnson, alongside the semi-autobiographical novel “The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian” by Sherman Alexie.\n\nAbout 55% of challenges before the law passed were for books about people of color; about 47% of challenges were for books featuring LGBTQ people; and about 25% of challenges were for books about people who survived sexual violence.\n\nConservative activists lobby for legislation; after passage, critics file lawsuits\n\nConservative activists, some with ties to the conservative parental rights group Moms for Liberty, took their case to the Iowa Legislature in 2023 and called the existing district-level book challenge process too difficult, subjective, biased and unresponsive to their concerns about books they felt were inappropriate for schools.\n\nThe new law, which took effect in July 2023, requires books in school libraries to be “age appropriate” and bans books depicting or describing sex acts. It also prohibits instruction or curriculum about gender identity and sexual orientation through sixth grade, which some school districts have interpreted to also include banning children's books with LGBTQ themes.\n\nThe results have been inconsistent: Some districts stripped dozens of books from shelves in their efforts to comply with the law, while others removed zero in the absence of guidance from the state Department of Education. Many districts have never disclosed to the Register which books they removed, if any.\n\nThe Register documented more than 1,300 books that were removed under the law by the time of this Iowa Poll, including controversial LGBTQ memoirs, popular young adult books, classic novels and nonfiction books about historical events.\n\nThe number includes some books that have since been restored. The three most-banned books have been “Nineteen Minutes” by Jodi Picoult, “Looking for Alaska” by John Green and “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” by Stephen Chbosky.\n\nLGBTQ students and their families, authors whose books have been banned and advocacy groups filed two lawsuits against the state of Iowa over Senate File 496, saying the law is unconstitutional and amounts to censorship and discrimination against LGBTQ viewpoints.\n\nIowa’s book ban remains tied up in court\n\nJudge Stephen Locher temporarily blocked the state from enforcing the book ban and disciplinary penalties for educators while the two lawsuits are pending in federal court. The decision did not require districts to restore the books they had removed.\n\nSome districts have restored books—about 560 in total, according to the Register’s tracking—while others have kept them off the shelves.\n\nSupporters of Senate File 496 have said the law protects children from pornographic and age-inappropriate content and that books removed from schools are not “banned” because they’re still available in city libraries or bookstores and online.\n\nOpponents have said book removals deprive students of enlightening stories about the diverse world around them while conflating literature with porn. They say librarians and parents should be trusted to decide what’s appropriate for students.\n\nChris Higgins covers the eastern and northern suburbs for the Register.

Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cell phone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.\n\nQuestions based on the sample of 804 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Results based on smaller samples of respondents — such as by gender or age — have a larger margin of error.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit and, on digital platforms, links to originating content on The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.\n\nRepublishing the copyright Iowa Poll without credit and, on digital platforms, links to originating content on The Des Moines Register and Mediacom is prohibited.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/17/iowa-legislature-which-bills-advanced-2nd-funnel-deadline-aea-ivf-immigration-kim-reynolds/72956021007/", "title": "Which bills advanced past the Iowa Legislature's 2nd funnel deadline?", "text": "Iowa lawmakers have shelved high-profile bills on fetal homicide, immigration, gender identity, birth control, the state auditor’s office, diversity, equity and inclusion programs and social studies education.\n\nThe Iowa Legislature’s second “funnel” deadline on Friday saw a flurry of Republican-backed bills fail to advance, including some priorities of Gov.

Ron DeSantis for his approval. Here are some of the most controversial changes coming Saturday that may affect you.\n\n1. You can carry a concealed weapon without a permit\n\nIf you are legally permitted to own a firearm, you can carry it concealed in Florida. You still must be a resident 21 or older to buy a weapon, unless you are a law enforcement or corrections officer or are in military service, and there still are restrictions on gun ownership for people convicted of a felony, dishonorably discharged, adjudicated mentally defective or involuntarily committed to treatment, convicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor or other conditions recognized by the state.\n\nBut the Public Safety law (HB 543) removes the requirement for a concealed weapons license and its mandatory background check and firearms training course before you could carry hidden weapons or firearms on your person or in a vehicle in Florida.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe bill also adds private schools to the list of educational facilities that can ask the local sheriff for help establishing a guardian program and requires various agencies and offices to develop threat management policies.\n\n2. If you're an undocumented immigrant, it will be harder for you to find employment in Florida and criminal for anyone to transport you in or out of the state\n\nAs of Saturday, Florida will enact some of the harshest anti-immigration laws in the country.\n\nCS/CS/SB 1718 - Immigration makes the following changes:\n\nTransporting a minor or more than five undocumented people into the state carries a second-degree felony penalty.\n\nCompanies with 25 or more employees will have to use the federal E-Verify system when hiring workers. Penalties for employers who don’t verify their employees’ status could face suspension of their licenses to operate.\n\nLocal governments will be banned from contributing money to organizations creating ID cards for undocumented immigrants, and driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens will be barred from use in Florida. Illegal migrants also could face felony charges by displaying a false ID to obtain employment.\n\nHospitals receiving state and federal Medicaid reimbursements will be required to track how much money is spent on undocumented immigrants in emergency rooms and must ask if a patient is in the country legally.\n\nA 2014 law that allowed undocumented immigrants to be admitted to practice law in Florida will be repealed.\n\nThe Division of Emergency Management’s Unauthorized Alien Transport Program get $12 million to continue the migrant-relocation program of transporting asylum-seekers to different places around the country.\n\n'It's definitely chaos':How immigration law impacts Florida restaurants, construction\n\nWho can and can't buy land in Florida?DeSantis' new property laws take effect in July\n\n3. If you use a public bathroom in Florida, you are required to use the ones that line up with your sex assigned at birth\n\nTrans people are now barred from entering certain bathrooms that do not match their gender.\n\nCS/HB 1521 - Facility Requirements Based on Sex applies to bathrooms at facilities such as public schools, colleges, universities, state and local government buildings, prisons and jails.\n\nUnder the law, people who enter bathrooms designated for the “opposite sex” could face trespassing charges. The bill includes exceptions for situations involving bathroom use by children under age 12, seniors and people with developmental disabilities.\n\nThe Florida law also defines a female as a “person belonging, at birth, to the biological sex which has the specific reproductive role of producing eggs.” It defines a male as “a person belonging, at birth, to the biological sex which has the specific reproductive role of producing sperm.”\n\n4. Schools in Florida will be starting later\n\nAs of Saturday, July 1, middle schools may not begin the “instructional day” earlier than 8 a.m., and high schools will be barred from starting the school day before 8:30 a.m. according to the newly passed Middle School and High School Start Times bill (CS/HB 733).\n\nDon't turn off your alarms yet. School districts have until the 2026-2027 school year to make the change.\n\n5. Healthcare providers in Florida can deny you service based on their moral, ethical, or religious beliefs\n\nAccording to the Protections of Medical Conscience bill (CS/SB 1580), \"any healthcare provider or facility licensed under a dozen different statutes, including doctors, nurses, pharmacies, hospitals, mental health providers, medical transport services, clinical lab personnel, nursing homes, and more\" may refuse services if they have a \"conscience-based objection\" based on \"a sincerely held religious, moral, or ethical belief.\" The bill also adds the following protections:\n\nHealthcare payors such as employers, health insurers, and health plans may refuse payment.\n\nHealthcare providers and payors are protected from liability for providing ‘conscience-based’ health care.\n\nMedical boards and the Department of Health are prohibited from taking disciplinary action or denying licenses to such healthcare providers if they have publicly spoken or written about a healthcare service or policy. This includes but is not limited to social media, according to the bill.\n\n6. If you're a teenager, you can't drive a golf cart in Florida without a permit or driver's license\n\nStarting Saturday, if you're under 18 you have to be at least 15 with a learner's permit to drive a golf cart, or 16 with a driver's license. If you're 18 and older, you have to have valid government-issued identification.\n\nCS/CS/HB 949: Operation of a Golf Cart changes Florida law from the previous age limit — 14 — and defines a golf cart as “a motor vehicle that is designed and manufactured for operation on a golf course for sporting or recreational purposes and that is not capable of exceeding speeds of 20 miles per hour.”\n\n7. You can't use TikTok on campus Wi-Fi or on a school- or government-issued device\n\nUniversities around the state already were banning TikTok on school equipment due to personal security risks.

Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

They’ve included everything from BMWs and Bentleys to Chevrolets and Fords. But one car in particular, the 1964 Aston Martin DB5, is known as the “the Bond car.”\n\nThe Bond character has been played by a number of actors and has driven many different cars in the more than two dozen films in the series. They’ve included everything from BMWs and Bentleys to Chevrolets and Fords. But the 1964 is still the best known “Bond car.”\n\nThe Bond car that the late actor Sean Connery first drove in the 1964 film “Goldfinger” was an Aston Martin DB5 replete with gadgets like machine guns, an ejector seat and an oil slick maker. More than 50 years later, Connery sought out a 1964 DB5 for himself and, after looking for over a year, finally bought one – without the movie car’s guns and gadgets – in early 2018. Connery died almost two years later at the age of 90. His DB5, the only one he ever actually owned, will be offered for sale at an auction this summer.\n\nThe car is expected to sell for between $1.4 million and $1.8 million, according to the auction company Broad Arrow Group. The car will be offered at Broad Arrow Group’s Monterey, California, auction on August 18, the company told CNN Business.\n\nSean Connery's Aston Martin DB5 sold for $2.4 million at a California auction. Courtesy Broad Arrow Group\n\nA 1964 Aston Martin DB5 in this car’s pristine condition would ordinarily be worth about $1 million even if Connery had never been anywhere near it, according to Hagerty. (Hagerty, a company that tracks collectible car values, is also a major investor in the recently founded Broad Arrow Group.)\n\nDB5s associated with the James Bond films have sold for vastly more than that, though. A gadget-filled DB5 that was used to promote the film’s original release sold for $6.4 million in 2019.\n\nDuring his life, Connery had often told his children of his fond memories of driving the Aston Martin in films, his son Jason Connery said in an interview. When they were grown they suggested to their father that he buy one, but he was resistant to the idea.\n\n“He’d say, ‘I don’t want to because it feels a bit obvious, you know, with me,’” Jason Connery said. “I said, ‘But forget it, it’s not about that.’”\n\nBarney Ruprecht, an Aston Martin specialist with Broad Arrow who had also consulted with Connery on making the purchase, advised Connery against getting a car in need of restoration since the work would probably take a couple of years, he said. Instead, he and Connery sought out a car that was in as near-perfect condition as possible. The car remains in very nearly that condition, according to Ruprecht, with only some creases in the seat leather as evidence it has been sat in.\n\nOnce Connery purchased the car, he had it repainted from black to Snow Shadow Gray, the color of the movie car. In the films, the car is described as being painted a color called Silver Birch, but the film was shot using a prototype of the DB5, not an actual production car. Silver Birch, a color that was offered on production versions of the DB5, wasn’t available at the time, Ruprecht said, so the car was painted in the slightly flatter, less metallic shade of gray that was offered on the DB4. The two colors would have been nearly indistinguishable on film, though, he said.\n\nBut after that work was done, there was little time left to actually drive it.\n\n“Unfortunately as he got older, traveling, especially to Europe [became difficult] and then COVID hit and…,” said Jason Connery. “You know, unfortunately, he never really got to enjoy the car that he’d bought.”\n\nThe car was kept by Connery at his home in Switzerland, according to Jason Connery. He was so fond of the car, he kept a photo of it on his desk.\n\nA portion of the proceeds from the sale will go to support the Connery Family Philanthropy Fund, according to the Broad Arrow Group, though the percentage going to charity will be announced later. In addition to the car itself, the winning bidder will get a ride in the car from the famous retired Formula 1 racing driver Jackie Stewart.\n\nStewart, like Connery, is from Scotland, and the two were longtime friends.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/tech/oceanone-diving-robot-scn/index.html", "title": "Diving robot explores shipwrecks on the ocean's bottom | CNN ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA robot created at Stanford University in California is diving down to shipwrecks and sunken planes in a way that humans can’t. Known as OceanOneK, the robot allows its operators to feel like they’re underwater explorers, too.\n\nOceanOneK resembles a human diver from the front, with arms and hands and eyes that have 3D vision, capturing the underwater world in full color.\n\nThe back of the robot has computers and eight multidirectional thrusters that help it carefully maneuver the sites of fragile sunken ships.\n\nOceanOneK, here doing an experiment in a swimming pool at Stanford University, resembles a human diver. Andrew Brodhead/Stanford News Service\n\nWhen an operator at the ocean’s surface uses controls to direct OceanOneK, the robot’s haptic (touch-based) feedback system causes the person to feel the water’s resistance as well as the contours of artifacts.\n\nOceanOneK’s realistic sight and touch capabilities are enough to make people feel like they’re diving down to the depths – without the dangers or immense underwater pressure a human diver would experience.\n\nStanford University roboticist Oussama Khatib and his students teamed up with deep-sea archaeologists and began sending the robot on dives in September. The team just finished another underwater expedition in July.\n\nSo far, OceanOneK has explored a sunken Beechcraft Baron F-GDPV plane, Italian steamship Le Francesco Crispi, a second century Roman ship off Corsica, a World War II P-38 Lightning aircraft and a submarine called Le Protée.\n\nThe Crispi sits about 1,640 feet (500 meters) below the surface of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n“You are moving very close to this amazing structure, and something incredible happens when you touch it: You actually feel it,” said Khatib, the Weichai Professor in Stanford’s School of Engineering and director of the Stanford Robotics Lab.\n\n“I’d never experienced anything like that in my life. I can say I’m the one who touched the Crispi at 500 (meters). And I did – I touched it, I felt it.”\n\nOceanOneK could be just the beginning of a future where robots take on underwater exploration too dangerous for humans and help us see oceans in a completely new way.\n\nStanford University roboticist Oussama Khatib (second from left) was able to feel sensations in his hands using the robot's feedback system. Frederic Osada/DRASSM/Stanford\n\nCreating an underwater robot\n\nThe challenge in creating OceanOneK and its predecessor, OceanOne, was building a robot that could endure an underwater environment and the immense pressure at various depths, Khatib said.\n\nOceanOne made its debut in 2016, exploring King Louis XIV’s wrecked flagship La Lune, which sits 328 feet (100 meters) below the Mediterranean 20 miles (32 kilometers) off southern France. The 1664 shipwreck remained untouched by humans.\n\nThe robot recovered a vase about the size of a grapefruit, and Khatib felt the sensations in his hands when OceanOne touched the vase before placing it in a recovery basket.\n\nThe idea for OceanOne came from a desire to study coral reefs within the Red Sea at depths beyond the normal range for divers. The Stanford team wanted to create something that came as close to a human diver as possible, integrating artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and haptic feedback.\n\nThe robot is about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long, and its brain can register how carefully it must handle an object without breaking it – like coral or sea-weathered artifacts. An operator can control the bot, but it’s outfitted with sensors and uploaded with algorithms so it can function autonomously and avoid collisions.\n\nWhile OceanOne was designed to reach maximum depths of 656 feet (200 meters), researchers had a new goal: 1 kilometer (0.62 miles), hence the new name for OceanOneK.\n\nThe team changed the robot’s body by using special foam that includes glass microspheres to increase buoyancy and combat the pressures of 1,000 meters – more than 100 times what humans experience at sea level.\n\nOceanOneK goes through a test of grasping an object in a Stanford pool. Andrew Brodhead/Stanford News Service\n\nThe researchers upgraded the robot’s arms with an oil and spring mechanism that prevents compression as it descends to the ocean depths. OceanOneK also got two new types of hands and increased arm and head motion.\n\nThe project comes with challenges he’s never seen in any other system, said Wesley Guo, a doctoral student at Stanford’s School of Engineering. “It requires a lot of out-of-the-box thinking to make those solutions work.”\n\nThe team used Stanford’s recreation pool to test out the robot and run through experiments, such as carrying a video camera on a boom and collecting objects. Then came the ultimate test for OceanOneK.\n\nDeep dives\n\nA Mediterranean tour that began in 2021 saw OceanOneK diving to these successive depths: 406 feet (124 meters) to the submarine, 1,095 feet (334 meters) to the Roman ship remains and ultimately 0.5 miles (852 meters) to prove it has the capability of diving to nearly 1 kilometer. But it wasn’t without problems.\n\nOceanOneK reaches for cargo from an ancient Roman ship. Frederic Osada/DRASSM/Stanford\n\nGuo and another Stanford doctoral student, Adrian Piedra, had to fix one of the robot’s disabled arms on the deck of their boat at night during a storm.\n\n“To me, the robot is eight years in the making,” Piedra said. “You have to understand how every single part of this robot is functioning – what are all of the things that can go wrong, and things are always going wrong. So it’s always like a puzzle. Being able to dive deep into the ocean and exploring some wrecks that would have never been seen this close up is very rewarding.”\n\nStudents work to fix an issue with OceanOneK during an expedition. Frederic Osada/DRASSM/Stanford\n\nDuring OceanOneK’s deep dive in February, team members discovered the robot couldn’t ascend when they stopped for a thruster check. Flotations on the communications and power line had collapsed, causing the line to pile on top of the robot.\n\nThey were able to pull in the slack, and OceanOneK’s descent was a success. It dropped off a commemorative marker on the seabed that reads, “A robot’s first touch of the deep seafloor/A vast new world for humans to explore.”\n\nKhatib, a professor of computer science, called the experience an “incredible journey.” “This is the first time that a robot has been capable of going to such a depth, interacting with the environment, and permitting the human operator to feel that environment,” he said.\n\nIn July, the team revisited the Roman ship and the Crispi. While the former has all but disappeared, its cargo remains scattered across the seafloor, Khatib said. At the site of the Roman ship, OceanOneK successfully collected ancient vases and oil lamps, which still bear their manufacturer’s name.\n\nThe robot carefully placed a boom camera inside the Crispi’s fractured hull to capture video of corals and rust formations while bacteria feast on the ship’s iron.\n\nThe robot extends a boom camera inside the hull of Italian steamship Le Francesco Crispi. Frederic Osada/DRASSM/Stanford\n\n“We go all the way to France for the expedition, and there, surrounded by a much larger team, coming from a wide array of backgrounds, you realize that the piece of this robot you’ve been working on at Stanford is actually part of something much bigger,” Piedra said.\n\n“You get a sense of how important this is, how novel and significant the dive is going to be, and what this means for science overall.”\n\nA promising future\n\nThe project born from an idea in 2014 has a long future of planned expeditions to lost underwater cities, coral reefs and deep wrecks. The innovations of OceanOneK also lay the groundwork for safer underwater engineering projects such as repairing boats, piers and pipelines.\n\nOne upcoming mission will explore a sunken steamboat in Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia.\n\nBut Khatib and his team have even bigger dreams for the project: space.\n\nKhatib said the European Space Agency has expressed interest in the robot. A haptic device aboard the International Space Station would allow astronauts to interact with the robot.\n\n“They can interact with the robot deep in the water,” Khatib said, “and this would be amazing because this would simulate the task of doing this on a different planet or different moon.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/27/entertainment/academy-awards-2022/index.html", "title": "Academy Awards 2022: 'CODA' wins Best Picture, but Will Smith ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“CODA” won best picture, but that historic breakthrough for streaming service Apple TV+ at the Oscars was overshadowed by one spontaneous act, as Will Smith delivered a viral moment that will be remembered and talked about for years.\n\nThe most memorable exchange on the film industry’s biggest night wasn’t the kind anyone would have anticipated or wanted. Before winning his Oscar for “King Richard,” Smith seemed upset about a joke that Chris Rock told about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, marching to the stage and appearing strike him across the face. Rock looked genuinely stunned, while Smith returned to his seat, shouting words that were bleeped out at Rock.\n\nWiping away tears, Smith during his acceptance speech referenced that the character he played, Richard Williams, protected his family, then said, without specifically mentioning Rock or what happened, “I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees.” He added, “Love will make you do crazy things.”\n\nThe best-picture suspense between two streaming nominees perceived as frontrunners lasted throughout the night. “CODA’s” Sian Heder won for best adapted screenplay, but “The Power of the Dog’s” Jane Campion, the first woman to be nominated twice as best director, later became the third woman ever to claim that prize. (Heder was overlooked in that balloting.)\n\nBased on results from other awards leading up to the Oscars, this was already viewed as a landmark year for streaming services, which, led by Netflix, have steadily chipped away at industry resistance to seeing them as full competitors with major studio releases.\n\nFor all its hard work, though, Netflix didn’t catch the bouquet, as voters went with Apple’s more uplifting story, about the hearing child of deaf parents. Including this year’s contenders “The Power of the Dog” and “Don’t Look Up,” seven Netflix movies have now been nominated for best picture, but thus far none have won.\n\nBest picture: \"CODA\" Apple TV+ Best actress: Jessica Chastain, \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye\" Searchlight Pictures Best actor: Will Smith, \"King Richard\" Chiabella James/Courtesy of Warner Bros.

Despite that decision, the telecast still ran more than 3 ½ hours.\n\n\"Dune\" won multiple Oscars on Sunday, including best cinematography Chia Bella James\n\nThe other big winner of the night was the science-fiction epic “Dune.” Dominating the technical categories, the Warner Bros. film claimed six Oscars for sound, film editing, production design, cinematography, visual effects and Hans Zimmer’s musical score. It was the prolific composer’s second win out of a dozen nominations, the first coming for “The Lion King” in 1995. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of WarnerMedia.)\n\nThe televised show underscored the emphasis on bringing more entertainment into the telecast, opening with Beyoncé performing the nominated song from “King Richard” outside the venue, before turning it over to hosts Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes, who gently roasted some of the nominees (“House of Gucci” was referred to as “House of Random Accents”) and taking aim at Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, promising, “We’re gonna have a gay night.” Sykes later directed a joke at Texas over its voter-registration laws.\n\n\"Encanto\" won best animanted feature film. Disney\n\nDisney’s “Encanto” was honored as best animated movie. Although the film performed reasonably well in theaters, it (and its music) appeared to particularly catch on after making its debut on the studio’s streaming service, Disney+, symbolic of a year viewed as streaming’s awards coming-out party.\n\nSupporting actress and actor represented perhaps the night’s least-suspenseful selections, but were among the most emotional, with Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur winning for Steven Spielberg’s remake of “West Side Story” and “CODA,” respectively. Kotsur becomes only the second deaf actor to be honored, following his co-star Marlee Matlin, who was recognized for “Children of a Lesser God” in 1987.\n\nSteven Spielberg, from left, Rita Moreno and Ariana DeBose arriving at the Oscars.

Nevertheless, there was a heightened sense of urgency to streamline the presentation after the Oscars slumped to record-low ratings last year, as did many major award shows.\n\nThe switch only saved a bit of time, which was used on lavish musical numbers – including a colorful rendition of “Encanto’s” song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” – comedy bits like dropping Schumer from the rafters dressed as Spider-Man, and showcasing “fan favorites” as unscientifically voted on via Twitter.\n\nThe broadcast also incorporated its share of nostalgia, including a 60th-anniversary James Bond movie tribute, cast reunions from “White Men Can’t Jump,” “Juno” and “Pulp Fiction,” and a 50th-anniversary celebration of “The Godfather,” bringing director Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro out for a standing ovation.\n\nThe latest Bond film, “No Time to Die,” garnered best song for Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, one of the few awards handed out to a box-office blockbuster, as the industry increasingly splits between popular and prestige fare.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/entertainment/david-warner-actor-death-omen-titanic-cec/index.html", "title": "David Warner, who played villains in 'Titanic' and 'Tron,' dies at 80 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDavid Warner, an English actor who played villainous supporting characters with aplomb in films like “Titanic” and “Tron,” died over the weekend. He was 80.\n\nWarner died from a “cancer-related illness,” his family said in a statement shared by his talent agency with CNN. He’d been sick for 18 months, his family wrote, and “approached his diagnosis with a characteristic grace and dignity.”\n\nHis was a prolific career that spanned more than 50 years, from horror classics to Oscar winners; from beloved animated series to a Disney musical. There was hardly a genre of film he didn’t leave a mark on, he acknowledged in a 2017 interview with the AV Club.\n\n“I’ve done war pictures, I’ve done Westerns, I’ve done sci-fi … I mean, I wasn’t in ‘Harry Potter,’ and I wasn’t in ‘Lord Of The Rings,’ and I haven’t been in ‘Game Of Thrones,’” he told the AV Club. “So there are those big ones that I haven’t managed to do. But that’s show biz … and, you know, I think I’ve still done okay.”\n\nA career spanning Shakespeare, horror and a best picture winner\n\nWarner began his career onstage after studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He starred in several productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing as the title roles in “Richard II” and “Hamlet.” He also appeared in the 1968 film adaptation of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” alongside Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Diana Rigg.\n\nThough he often played Shakespearean heroes onstage, in films, he was often cast as the antagonist. In Disney’s landmark sci-fi flick “Tron,” he played a power-hungry executive who passed off Jeff Bridges’ ideas as his own. In “Titanic,” he conspired with Billy Zane’s antagonist to keep the central lovebirds apart as the deliciously named Spicer Lovejoy. And in Terry Gilliam’s “Time Bandits,” Warner quite literally played the role of “Evil.”\n\nDavid Warner (right) played Spicer Lovejoy in \"Titanic,\" a snide companion to Billy Zane's Caldeon Hockley. 20th Century Fox/Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nSome of Warner’s most enduring roles saw him play the second banana: In “The Omen,” he wasn’t the villain but the victim, portraying a photographer threatened by the demonic child Damien. He also appeared in three of director Sam Peckinpah’s films, including the World War II ensemble film “Cross of Iron.”\n\nWhen he could, Warner played against type, appearing as Ebenezer Scrooge’s sympathetic employee Bob Cratchit in a TV movie of “A Christmas Carol.” He acted in two “Star Trek” films, including one appearance as a Klingon. In his last film role, he played eccentric military veteran Admiral Boom, who regularly fires cannons to mark the time, in “Mary Poppins Returns.”\n\nHe also lent his voice to animated productions, like “Batman: The Animated Series” (as Ra’s al Ghul) and “The Amazing World of Gumball.” He said in 2017 appearing in “kids pictures,” like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II,” was “great fun.” He also mentioned his “utmost respect for the actors in the turtle suits.”\n\nIn \"Tron,\" Warner played a tech exec who stole protagonist Jeff Bridges' work. Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nDespite his prolific career, Warner often regarded his legacy with a lightheartedness. In the 2017 AV Club interview, Warner said that as a young person, he was “hopeless” both academically and athletically, and so he “drifted into the odd school play.”\n\n“I’m the kind of actor where you go around, you do your best, and you see what happens,” he told the AV Club.\n\nDavid Warner remembered\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, who starred with Warner in “Mary Poppins Returns,” shared a photo of himself with the late actor.\n\n“So glad to have been able to express my admiration for David Warner’s incredible versatility and career in our time together on set,” Miranda wrote on Twitter. “My goodness, what a life and legacy.”\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company remembered Warner as he was in 1965, when he played Hamlet as a “tortured student in his long orange scarf.”\n\n“David seemed the epitome of 1960s youth, and caught the radical spirit of a turbulent age,” said the company’s artistic director emeritus Gregory Doran. “He was a generous spirit, a kind man, and a huge talent.”\n\nWarner is survived by his partner Lisa Bowerman, son Luke and his “many gold dust friends,” among others, his family wrote in their statement.\n\n“He will be missed hugely by us, his family and friends, and remembered as a kind-hearted, generous and compassionate man, partner and father whose legacy of extraordinary work has touched the lives of so many over the years,” his family said.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}]}

What to know about philanthropist ...", "text": "OAKLAND, California ‒ Lawyer and philanthropist Nicole Shanahan will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s running mate in his long-shot bid for the U.S. presidency, the pair announced Tuesday.\n\nKennedy made the announcement at a campaign event in Oakland, her hometown.\n\nAbout 500 people filled the floor of the Henry J. Kaiser Center for the Arts and more than 30,000 tuned into the livestream with many suggesting their favorite vice presidential picks, ranging from former U.S. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) to New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\n\nHe said he liked her for her commitment to health and organic foods and \"deep, inside knowledge\" of how the technology industry uses artificial intelligence to manipulate the public and identify government abuses. He also wanted an athlete, he said, describing Shanahan as an avid surfer and a softball player in her youth. He wanted, he said, a gifted administrator, an inquiring mind, someone open to changing her opinions, who is spiritual, idealistic and \"above all (someone with) a deep love for the United States of America.\"\n\nIn some ways, Shanahan was an odd choice. A registered Democrat, she has no political or executive experience and most of her philanthropic support has gone to mainstream science ‒ while Kennedy, who quit the Democratic party last fall, has made a national reputation dismissing the scientific findings of vaccine developers and public health experts.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIn other ways, though, the 38-year-old, makes a lot of sense. She has already donated more than $4 million to his campaign, including the lion's share of funding for a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl.\n\nThe ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a long-time Silicon Valley resident, Shanahan has connections throughout the tech world. Kennedy has tried to cultivate support within the technology sector, including making an appearance at the SXSW conference in Austin earlier this month.\n\nKennedy said she understands better than either mainstream candidates the \"promise and peril\" of technology.\n\nChoosing a running mate\n\nShanahan's youth and wealth may help Kennedy, who is 70 and a member of the closest Americans come to having a political royal family. But really, several political scientists said, his choice of a running mate, isn't all that significant.\n\n\"The chances of this person becoming vice president are close to zero,\" said Peter Ubertaccio, a professor of political scence and vice president for academic affairs at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts. No third-party candidate has won the U.S. presidency in well over a century.\n\n\"The nomination of Ms. Shanahan will make no difference whatsoever in Kennedy's bid,\" added Jeffrey Berry, a political science professor emeritus at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. \"People don't vote for vice president. They vote for president.\"\n\nBut the choice of running mate is the first significant decision a presidential candidate has to make and therefore reflects on them, said Christopher Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton in Ohio.\n\nVoters want to see a vice presidential candidate they could imagine in the White House, said Devine, co-author of of the book \"Do Running Mates Matter?\" \"There's good evidence that when people see a VP pick who is not instantly a credible vice president they question a presidential candidate's judgement and they're less likely to vote for that person.\"\n\nDevine said the selection of Shanahan was not a good look for Kennedy. \"This is not the kind of move you would make if you truly anticipated becoming the next president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nSomeone like Kennedy who lacks any governing experience would be expected to choose a running mate with some expertise in foreign policy or negotiating with Congress, he said. Even Donald Trump, who famously had no political experience in 2016 when he ran for president the first time, chose Mike Pence as his running mate ‒ a former Congressman and Indiana governor.\n\nThe main reason to choose Shanahan, Devine said, seems to be for her money. As a running mate, she is not limited by campaign contribution limits.\n\nHow they're selected:What we know now about choosing a running mate and its impact on voters\n\nIt may help Shanahan to be a VP candidate, Berry said, if she has political ambitions in her home state of California, but probably won't raise her national profile much, unless she's willing to fund a major national tour for herself in addition to Kennedy, complete with an advance team and communications people.\n\nNicole Shanahan's personal life\n\nShanahan, who declined several requests from USA TODAY for an interview, is the daughter of a Chinese immigrant mother and a father of German-Irish descent who suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nIn a video and a half-hour speech, she mentioned her difficult childhood, growing up in Oakland. Her family depended on welfare for a time, living \"one misfortune away from disaster,\" as her father's struggles repeatedly cost him jobs.\n\nIn her junior year of high school, she traveled to El Salvador, which was then still recovering from a 12-year civil war. The experience turned her into a pacificist and peace activist ‒ which at the time meant leading her fellow students on a march to the local radio station.\n\nShe attended college at the University of Puget Sound and then worked as a paralegal and patent specialist for a number of years.\n\nHer first marriage to San Francisco investor and finance executive Jeremy Asher Kranz reportedly lasted from 2013 to 2015. She was attending the Santa Clara University School of Law at the time, graduating in 2014.\n\nShe reportedly met Brin that year at a yoga retreat and the pair married in 2018, the same year their daughter Echo was born. They separated in 2021 and divorced last year.\n\nIt's unclear how much money she received in their confidentical divorce proceedings, but in 2022, Brin donated $23 million worth of shares in Alphabet, Google's parent company, to the philanthropy she founded and presides over, the Bia-Echo Foundation.\n\nShanahan provided $4 million to support a controversial $7 million Kennedy advertisement that ran during the Super Bowl. Last year, she donated $500,000 to the pro-Kennedy group Common Sense and the legal limit of $6,600 last year to Kennedy's campaign. She has donated to other candidates in the past, including Biden's 2020 campaign and Hillary Clinton's 2016 White House bid.\n\nShe founded ClearAccessIP, a Palo Alto-based lawfirm that helps patent owners manage and monetize their intellectual property right, which she sold in 2020. She remains listed as a research fellow at CodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, which she described as focusing on \"humanistic coding.\"\n\nShe was photographed on red carpets with Brin a number of times, and was alleged by the Wall Street Journal to have had an affair with Elon Musk, which both she and Musk repeatedly denied. She told People magazine in a story addressing her reaction to the negative publicity, that the two were friends and she spoke with him about whether his company Neuralink could provide assistance to Echo, who has autism.\n\nShe blamed the end of her marriage not on an affair, but on the challenges of \"living as a wife of a billionaire.\"\n\n\"I was not the best version of myself,” she told the magazine. “I felt conflicted every day, like I couldn’t access the thing that made me what I am.”\n\nLast May, Shanahan reportedly held a \"love ceremony\" with Jacob Strumwasser, a vice president at Lightning Labs, whom she met at the Burning Man festival in 2022.\n\nShanahan's philanthropy\n\nShanahan said her childhood of deprivation and priveleged adulthood have taught her that \"the purpose of wealth is to help those in need.\"\n\nTo that end, she has devoted most of her public activities in recent years to health philanthropy, mainly in the areas of autism, \"food as medicine,\" and female aging. \"Healthy soil is the foundation of healthy food,\" she said and \"our answer to the climate crisis.\"\n\nShe was a \"convening participant\" and a financial supporter of President Joe Biden's 2022 Task Force on Hunger, Nutrition and Health, though she said Tuesday that she has left the Democratic party because it is not living up to its ideals.\n\nShe has also committed $100 million over the course of her lifetime to promoting female longevity and has already seeded the creation of the Buck Institute's Center for Reproductive Longevity and Equality with a $6 million donation, in addition to a $20 million contribution toward the creation of a global consortium promoting women's reproductive health and longevity.\n\nShanahan has said she became interested in female reproductive health after facing fertility issues before conceiving Echo.\n\nJennifer Garrison, the scientist who runs both the center and the global consortium, said Shanahan's contributions have been essential to bringing attention and much-needed support to an underfunded area of research that could help better explain aging for everyone.\n\nAlthough half the world's population is female, little is known about how and why ovaries age faster than the body's other tissues, and the other roles ovaries play in human health.\n\n\"What we're talking about is not just young women who are having fertility issues, not just women in perimenopause or going through menopause, but we're talking about a woman's entire adult life,\" Garrison said. \"We don't understand how female bodies work at any point in adult life ‒ but we can. This is all knowable. None of this is rocket science. We just have to literally collect the data.\"\n\nShanahan was the first philanthropist to see the importance of digging into this science, learning more and helping women age better, she said.\n\nShanahan's platform\n\nShanahan spoke passionately about the importance of curing people from the chronic diseases that are plaguing them ‒ diseases she believes are caused by modern life. Curing them, she said, will cure America.\n\n\"What is possible for the human being is also possible for our nation,\" she said.\n\nShe blamed chronic illnesses like the infertility she suffered, her daughter's autism and rampant mental health challenges on three major causes.\n\nFirst, she said, endocrine disruptors in food and chemicals in our environment make it harder for the body to heal.\n\nElectrochemical exposures from wireless technologies and devices, such as cell phones, compound the problems, she said.\n\nAnd medications, often prescribed to treat problems caused by the first two actually exacerbate them, she said. She did not name vaccines, but Kennedy is known for his anti-vaccine stance.\n\nAll three claims have limited or no scientific support.\n\nAs vice president, Shanahan said she would address those concerns by using artificial intelligence to examine medical data bases. \"We just have to ask the right questions, do the right research and apply the right tools,\" she said. \"We have to rid science of the corporate bias … and throw this into reverse.\"\n\nShe concluded by promising voters \"to make this world a little less crazy.\"\n\nKaren Weintraub can be reached at kweintraub@usatoday.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2024/03/12/aaron-rodgers-listed-as-vice-president-running-mate-robert-kennedy-jr-rfk-presidential-candidate/72949636007/", "title": "Will Aaron Rodgers be vice president?

A couple years ago, he also got into a war of words with President Joe Biden around the vaccine.\n\nHis candidate is RFK Jr., who is part of the famed Kennedy family, though many have been outspoken against his anti-vaccine beliefs.\n\n\"I believe in medical freedom and informed consent, and I'm voting for Robert Kennedy Jr.,\" Rodgers said during his Oct. 27 appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" Rodgers has called RFK Jr. \"my man.\"\n\nOPINION:Aaron Rodgers as VP is a joke. So is his commitment to the New York Jets.\n\nAaron Rodgers, RFK Jr. and the COVID vaccine\n\nRodgers and Kennedy see eye-to-eye and are vocal in their skepticism of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nRodgers, who isn't vaccinated, has made the pandemic and the vaccine his go-to talking point since his positive test after Halloween 2021, blasting the NFL over their health and safety protocols in 2021, advocating for the controversial drug ivermectin, referencing being a victim of cancel culture and supporting other athletes who speak out against vaccinations.\n\nRodgers also recently said that he does not plan to lower his volume around COVID-19.\n\n\"I don’t want the memories to be lost,\" said Rodgers, citing during a podcast with Joe Rogan of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" that he \"lost\" friends, allies in the media and millions of dollars in sponsorship for expressing his beliefs. \"I don’t want what I went through to get brushed over. And also, I don’t give a (f---).\"\n\nRFK Jr. frequently discusses anti-vaccine views and conspiracy theories.\n\nAaron Rodgers asked Robert Kennedy Jr. to be his partner to debate Anthony Fauci and Travis Kelce\n\nIt could be a shock to some that Rodgers would be approached for the vice president job. But there might not be a bigger supporter for RFK Jr.'s campaign than Rodgers.\n\nThe four-time NFL MVP has invoked Kennedy's name often during his regular appearances on \"The Pat McAfee Show,\" which airs on ESPN, as well as on social media over the last year.\n\nBack in October he told McAfee's large audience that he wanted RFK Jr. to team with him to take on Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl-winning tight end Travis Kelce and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who previously led the country's coronavirus response and served as chief medical adviser to the president, in a debate around COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nKelce was part of a campaign with pharmaceutical company Pfizer to promote COVID-19 boosters last fall, along with flu shots. While appearing on McAfee's show Rodgers called Kelce \"Mr. Pfizer.\"\n\nKelce responded to that nickname, saying he never thought he would get into \"a vax war\" with Rodgers, which then led the quarterback to seek a debate with the Chiefs All-Pro, as well as Fauci, whom he called \"a pharmacrat.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/19/nicole-shanahan-maybe-rfk-jr-running-mate/73020386007/", "title": "Who is Nicole Shanahan, RFK Jr's possible vice president pick?", "text": "Nicole Shanahan, a Northern California environmental lawyer who co-funded and helped create Robert F.

But she grew up in Oakland.\n\nThe Kennedy campaign on Monday also did not confirm or deny Shanahan as a possible VP choice as first reported by Mediaite on Saturday. Other rumored names for the spot had included former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura and New York Jets star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, neither of whom has any obvious connections to Oakland.\n\nOn Friday, a video of Kennedy was posted saying he had made his VP pick and \"It’s not any of the people they’ve been talking about.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"There has been a lot of speculation in the media about Mr. Kennedy’s pick of vice presidential running mate,\" Kennedy's campaign told USA TODAY in a statement on Monday. \"The official announcement will be on March 26 in Oakland, Calif.\"\n\nShananan is' definitely interested' in supporting RFK Jr. campaign\n\nShanahan told USA TODAY she supports Kennedy's candidacy.\n\n\"I am definitely interested in further supporting RFK Jr. for President,\" Shanahan said. \"In my opinion, he is the best presidential candidate we have on the issues close to my heart: environmental health, regenerative agriculture and social justice.\"\n\nShanahan told USA TODAY that her roughly $4 million donation to American Values, a super Political Action Committee backing Kennedy, was specifically meant to help pay for the commercial. She helped choose the look and music for the 30-second spot, inspired by an ad from his uncle John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. Kennedy is the son of Robert F. Kennedy who served as attorney general in his brother's administration.\n\nShanahan, a registered Democrat, told USA TODAY last month that she gave Kennedy's campaign $6,600 when he was running in the Democratic primary last fall and was \"upset\" when he left the party to run for president as an independent.\n\nBut, Shanahan said, \"I had a change of heart as I was listening to people and watching his campaign and seeing the polls ‒ those were the three things that were viable to me that this is an interesting campaign.\"\n\nShanahan could be a 'smart choice,' experts say\n\nIndependent women are crucial to Democratic candidates this year. They prevented a red wave in the 2022 midterm election when they voted for Democratic U.S. Senate candidates against Trump-endorsed Republicans, said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston who oversees the USA TODAY/Suffolk University survey.\n\n\"RFK Jr. is already very competitive among independent women today. In our last national survey, RFK Jr. only trailed Joe Biden by 8 points and Donald Trump by 2 points among independent women,\" Paleologos said. \"So, future polling will tell us whether Nicole Shanahan adds anything to a demographic that Kennedy already is showing strength in.\"\n\nShanahan's presence on the ticket could solidify these voters and open the door to younger Democratic and Republican women, Paleologos said.\n\n\"She's young, rich, and has donated to numerous Democratic causes while having a lot of powerful Republican business associates in her social circles,\" Paleologos said. \"That goes a long way in politics.\"\n\nBrian Sobel, a longtime political analyst based in the San Francisco Bay Area agrees. With age being a major topic in this year's presidential race, Shanahan is \"the antithesis of the status quo,\" he said.\n\nChoosing her \"may be a natural selection for Kennedy to help cement women and young women voters, in particular,\" he said, despite her lack of political experience. \"She may also appeal to voters who wish to support diversity on the presidential ticket, along with backing a smart, savvy, progressive entrepreneur, who is younger than anyone yet being identified as a possible candidate.\"\n\nShanahan's background\n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Shanahan is the founder and president of Bia-Echo Foundation, which is described as \"a private foundation that aims to invest in changemakers at the forefront of innovation who are tackling some of the world's greatest challenges: reproductive longevity & equality, criminal justice reform and a healthy & livable planet.\"\n\nShanahan is also the founder and CEO of ClearAccessIP, \"an automated patent management and valuation platform,\" based in Palo Alto, California, her LinkedIn bio said. Shanahan received her bachelor's degree from the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, Washington, studying Asian Studies, Economics and Mandarin Chinese.

His support is growing, but cash ...", "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. — Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is slated to announce his vice-presidential pick Tuesday at a time when his campaign has gained some early traction with voters but appears to be short on cash.\n\nHis \"Team Kennedy\" campaign raised $29 million in February but spent $22 million of it, so ended the month with just over $5 million, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nA Super PAC has also been raising money on his behalf. Called American Values 2024, it raised $4.2 million in February and spent nearly $9 million, leaving it with $18.5 million.\n\nHis campaign has told USA TODAY that it needs $30 million simply to get on the ballot in all 50 states. So far, he is on the ballot in Utah and has collected enough signatures to earn a spot in Nevada and New Hampshire. But CBS News reported late Monday that he might have to start all over again in Nevada because a running mate was not named on his petition.\n\nHis \"We the People\" party has enough signatures to establish itself in Hawaii.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nA statement released by the campaign said Kennedy stands for \"restoring the middle class, ending the chronic disease epidemic, unwinding the war machine, and unraveling corporate capture of our government agencies.\"\n\nFundraising challenges\n\nThere's no doubt Kennedy, 70, a long-time lawyer and activist, could use additional financial support.\n\nThe PAC's biggest contribution in February came from Gavin de Becker, an author and expert in providing security to public officials. He donated $4 million in February, as well as $10 million earlier this year, which was later converted to a loan, and $4.5 million last year. Gavin de Becker and Associates LP has received about $1.4 million in expenses from Kennedy’s campaign in February, according to campaign filings.\n\nThe next biggest chunk of Kennedy's financial support so far has come from Mellon Bank heir Timothy Mellon, who is also a longtime supporter of former president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, as well as the biggest donor to the border wall Trump long touted. That has led to speculation that Mellon and others who support Kennedy are doing so to harm President Joe Biden's reelection bid.\n\nSuch support from a Trump backer could affect how some voters see Kennedy, said Peter Ubertaccio, a professor of political scence and vice president for academic affairs at Stonehill College in Easton, Massachusetts.\n\nKennedy's ability to sway even a few voters in key swing states will certainly lead to a Democratic response, he said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee already filed a federal election complaint against his campaign saying it has benefited illegally from American Value 2024 support.\n\nHow the Democratic party responds to a continuing threat from Kennedy could drive voters to him or away, Ubertaccio said.\n\nThe next biggest donor is Nicole Shanahan, who has been rumored to be his pick for a running mate, a decision he is expected to make Tuesday in Oakland, California, her hometown.\n\nShanahan, a lawyer, philanthropist and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, provided $4 million to support a controversial $7 million Kennedy advertisement that ran during the Super Bowl. Last year, she donated $500,000 to the pro-Kennedy group Common Sense and the legal limit of $6,600 last year to Kennedy's campaign. She has donated to other candidates in the past, including Biden's 2020 campaign and Hillary Clinton's 2016 White House bid.\n\nShanahan previously told USA TODAY she provided creative direction for the recent Super Bowl ad, which drew liberally from a commercial his uncle John F. Kennedy used in his successful 1960 presidential campaign.\n\nThe rest of Kennedy family has distanced themselves from him. RFK Jr., son of the attorney general of the same name, is known for his opposition to vaccines, a stance other family members say would have \"appalled\" his aunt Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who devoted her life to protecting children against diseases and birth defects.\n\nRFK Jr. apologized to his cousins after they complained about the Super Bowl but then pinned it to the top of his social media profile for a time.\n\nMuch of the Kennedy clan ‒ but not RFK Jr. ‒ celebrated St. Patrick's Day earlier this month with President Joe Biden at the White House.\n\nThe Kennedy name is a \"nationally recognized brand\" in American politics, though more in Massachusetts than elsewhere, said Ubertaccio, who has followed the family's political fortunes.\n\n\"This particular Kennedy is unorthodox in many ways.\"\n\nKennedy's voter support\n\nKennedy's campaign points to polling that shows he has strong support among young people, independents and Latino voters.\n\nPolitical scientists said third-party candidates typically poll much better in the springtime than they do as the first Tuesday in November approaches.\n\nMany are unhappy with both Biden and former president Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, but ultimately \"people don't want to waste their vote,\" Ubertaccio said.\n\nTraditionally, third-party candidates have acted as \"spoilers,\" preventing Democratic or Republican candidates from winning. In 1992, businessman Ross Perot helped Democrat Bill Clinton deny George H.W. Bush a second term. Ralph Nader returned the favor in 2000, taking enough votes away from Democrat Al Gore that Bush's son won the electoral college and became president.\n\nIn a recent online poll of 4,000 Americans from March 7 to 13, Kennedy picked up “disaffected middle and center independents” as well as suburban women, turned off by the Republican hard-line against abortion, said Cliff Young, president of U.S. public affairs at Ipsos, which conducted the survey.\n\n\"He does seems to capture the fringe. Overall he’s picking up a chunk of the electorate who don’t like either Trump or Biden,\" Young said.\n\nBut the more the public knows about Kennedy's unorthodox views, the more he may have trouble holding onto his current support, said Jeffrey Berry, a political science professor emeritus at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\n\"As Kennedy attracts more attention, it's not necessarily going to be to his benefit,\" he said.\n\nKennedy's outsider status is \"resonating right now. I just don't know if it will hold going into November,\" Ubertaccio added. \"He's likely at the high point of his candidacy.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/03/trump-running-mate-poll/72072380007/", "title": "Dear Mr. Trump: Your backers have some ideas for a running mate ...", "text": "How about Vice President Vivek Ramaswamy?\n\nThough not a single voter has cast a ballot for the 2024 presidential nominations yet, surely it's not too soon to start the speculation about Donald Trump's pick as running mate.\n\nFor starters, the general election is heading toward a rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden, but there's basically no one in American politics who thinks Trump will repeat his vice presidential pick from 2016 (when he won) and 2020 (when he lost). That would be Mike Pence, cast out of Trump world after refusing to disrupt the Electoral College count that put Biden in the White House in 2021.\n\nIn our new USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll, when we asked Trump supporters to name their choice for the No. 2 spot, it was Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis who finished first, at 14%.\n\nSorry, folks. That's almost certainly not going to happen, given the fractured relations between the two after DeSantis emerged for a time as the most likely alternative to Trump. The former president rewarded DeSantis with the derisive nickname \"DeSanctimonious.\" (There are also constitutional complications from having both members of a ticket come from the same state.)\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThen there's Ramaswamy, volunteered by 10%. The entrepreneur and political newcomer has done the most of any in the field to emulate and defend Trump in the GOP debates that the former president has declined to join. Most recently, he has vowed to remove his name from any state ballot that bumps Trump.\n\nUnlike those first two, file Ramaswamy's name under \"not impossible.\"\n\nNote that, if elected, he wouldn't be the first Asian-American to serve as vice president; that status belongs to the current officeholder, Kamala Harris. But he would be the first person since Henry Wallace, Franklin Roosevelt's second vice president, to be elected No. 2 before he had won election to any other office.\n\n(Trump seems unlikely to think of that as a bar. He is the most recent president to win the top job without ever having held elective office himself.)\n\nAnother pick that doesn't seem impossible is Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor appointed by Trump as U.N. ambassador in his administration. In her campaign challenging him for the 2024 nomination, she has tried to navigate a line between criticizing Trump but not so much that his supporters might refuse to back her, now or later.\n\nIn our poll, 7% proposed her name.\n\nWell behind at 2% was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now an independent presidential candidate. If chosen, it would be the first time a close member of that storied Democratic family appeared on the Republican line as a candidate. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and populist provocateur Tucker Carlson were at 1%.\n\nNot to overstate the groundswell: That means six respondents named her; five chose him.\n\nThe poll of 438 Trump voters, taken by landline and cellphone Dec. 26-29, has a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points.\n\nMost of those surveyed seem ready to leave the decision up to Trump.

They could threaten to tip the scales in a potential match-up between likely Democratic nominee President Joe Biden and Republican frontrunner former President Donald Trump.\n\nPoll after poll has shown voters aren't enthusiastic about a Biden-Trump rematch. Even GOP presidential contender Chris Christie called it a “crappy choice” during a recent campaign stop, telling a crowd of New Hampshire voters they “don’t have an obligation to vote for either of them” if that’s the choice in November.\n\nCandidates outside the Democratic and Republican parties have captured some support from the politically disillusioned in recent months. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll from the end of December showed an unnamed third-party candidate garnering 17% in the 2024 race for the White House.\n\nWell-known figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Cornel West and Jill Stein declared their candidacies last year, and other names have sprouted up as potential wild cards. These candidates are bound to face an uphill battle qualifying for general election ballots, as every state sets their own requirements. But garnering votes in just a few key swing states could be enough to shift the results of a close November election.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere’s a look at how declared and potential third-party candidates could shake up the race.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. piques voter interest\n\nKennedy, an environmental lawyer and heir to his family’s political legacy, is perhaps the most popular third-party presidential candidate. He’s also the first to officially qualify to appear on a November ballot, after filing in Utah.\n\nOne Monmouth University poll from early December showed 1 in 5 registered voters open to backing Kennedy in a general election match-up that also featured Biden and Trump. The recent Suffolk University/USA TODAY poll found Kennedy garnering 10% support nationally, more than any other third-party candidate listed.\n\nBarbara Perry, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, suggested Kennedy is most likely to appeal to hesitant Trump-leaning voters “who believe generally in his policies in a conspiratorial kind of way.”\n\nKennedy has expressed debunked views about vaccines and embraced conspiracy theories about the origins of COVID-19.\n\nRepublican organizers have raised alarm bells about Kennedy’s campaign, with one Trump spokesperson, Steven Cheung, calling the third-party hopeful someone “who pretends to have conservative values.\"\n\nCornel West’s progressive appeal\n\nA longtime progressive activist and scholar, West ignited some concern among Democrats when he first announced his third-party candidacy in July. West is a widely respected liberal thought leader and was a key surrogate for Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., during his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns.\n\nAs Biden struggles to spark enthusiasm among some key Democratic constituencies, West could threaten to tear crucial voters away from the president if he qualifies to appear on state ballots in November.\n\nPerry said West’s liberal brand could appeal to younger voters and those dissatisfied with Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, pushing for better protections for Palestinian civilians in the conflict.\n\nWest, a longtime member of the Democratic Socialists of America, has promised he would call on the International Criminal Court to investigate Israeli forces for potential war crimes. He also widely criticized Israel during a recent campaign stop in Michigan.\n\nWhile West received just 2% support in the recent Suffolk University/USA TODAY national survey, Perry argued he could emerge as a spoiler candidate if enough progressive voters support him on moral grounds, even if they don’t believe he can win.\n\nCould Jill Stein tip the scales?\n\nTwo-time Green Party nominee Jill Stein is throwing her hat into the presidential ring once again, running on a message that the “the political system is broken.”\n\nStein, who previously ran in 2012 and 2016, has drawn backlash from Democrats who argue she cost Hillary Clinton the presidency in 2016. During that election, the environmental activist won more votes than Trump’s margin of victory in three swing states – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nPolitical analysts have also argued that Stein drew crucial votes from Clinton, receiving 1% support nationally during the election.\n\nStein hasn’t achieved ballot access in any states so far in 2024, though the deadlines for doing so are still months away. The Suffolk/USA TODAY poll of 1,000 registered voters conducted at the end of December found Stein garnering 1.3% support.\n\nNo labels mulls consensus ticket\n\nThe bipartisan group No Labels, a centrist nonprofit organization, has floated adding a bipartisan ticket to the ballot in all 50 states in 2024.\n\nThe group, founded by former Democratic fundraiser Nancy Jacobson and former Sen. Joe Lieberman, has secured ballot access in a dozen states and is operating in an additional 15 where it has either filed or is working to get the necessary support. The group isn't expected to launch an official ticket for months, and organizers have said they'll only do so if Trump and Biden were the nominees for each of their parties.\n\nDemocrats have often called out the group, with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly describing it as “perilous to our democracy.”\n\nNo Labels has fought back against those claims – arguing that it wouldn't launch a ticket it believed it wouldn't win.\n\n“This whole thing with the spoiler – it's a little bit of a chicken and egg question,” Ryan Clancy, chief strategist for the group, told USA TODAY. “What if there was a ticket that wasn't polling at 8% or 5%, but was polling at 30%? When that tipping point comes where people think this is real and this could happen, we don't think they'll just go and vote for one of the major party nominees. But they’ve got to think it's real.”\n\nBut the group has signaled that it hears its critics' arguments. Lieberman recently suggested during an interview on SiriusXM that the group may scrap the unity ticket effort if it would help Trump.\n\n\"No Labels doesn't want to do anything in this campaign that will make the Trump reelection more possible,\" Lieberman said on \"The Julie Mason Show.\" \"We're not happy with the Trump-Biden choice, but I think Trump really is a threat to the country, and I think Biden is not.\"\n\nJoe Manchin contemplates a run\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin’s name surfaced as a potential option for the unity ticket after he announced he would not seek reelection for his West Virginia seat in 2024.\n\nAnd so far, Manchin hasn’t ruled out a presidential run, telling NBC’s “Meet the Press” host Kristen Welker last month that he was “absolutely” considering a White House bid.\n\n“Every American should consider it if they're in a position to help save the country,\" the centrist said. “I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure, to mobilize that moderate, sensible, commonsense middle.”\n\nManchin is kicking off what he's calling a national listening tour in New Hampshire next week in an effort to mobilize people who feel they don’t belong to either political party, a group he dubs the “moderate middle.”\n\nThe effort is not affiliated with No Labels, but Manchin has worked closely with the group in the past.\n\nClancy said that No Labels is not in talks with Manchin at the moment and “nobody's got an inside track on the nomination” in response to the speculation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/14/robert-kennedy-jr-s-presidential-campaign-to-stop-in-arizona/71918247007/", "title": "Robert Kennedy Jr.'s presidential campaign to stop in Arizona", "text": "Independent presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr., a prominent critic of vaccines of all types, is planning a visit to Arizona on Dec. 20, according to his campaign.\n\nThe event is planned from 5:30-7:30 p.m. at the Legends Event Center near 42nd Avenue and Camelback Road.\n\nKennedy is attempting to gather signatures to appear on the Arizona ballot.\n\nWith former President Donald Trump expected to win the Republican nomination to run against President Joe Biden in next year's presidential election, Kennedy Jr. is widely seen as a spoiler, with little chance of winning the race but possibly tipping it toward Trump, particularly in swing states.\n\nKennedy Jr. initially planned to run for president as a Democrat but shifted to independent in October.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nKennedy Jr.'s long history of false claims about vaccines warranted a three-part fact-checking series from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania earlier this year.\n\nThe report notes his anti-vaccine campaign began in 2005 when he published a story in Rolling Stone and on Salon.com falsely suggesting vaccines cause autism. Salon retracted the story and Rolling Stone deleted it.\n\nWho is Robert Kennedy Jr.? How is he related to JFK?\n\nKennedy's family is well-known in politics. His uncle John F.

Robert Kennedy also served as a U.S. senator from New York and was a presidential candidate in 1968, when he was assassinated in Los Angeles.\n\nWhat does Kennedy Jr. need to do to get on the ballot?\n\nAs an Independent not affiliated with a major political party, Kennedy Jr. could skip Arizona's Presidential Preference Election on March 19 and proceed to the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nTo get on the ballot, he not only will need to name a running mate and 11 electors, but gather signatures. Arizona requires such candidates get signatures from 3% of registered voters as of Jan. 2.\n\nWhile that number is not yet known, as of the last count in October, Arizona had about 4.2 million registered voters, meaning Kennedy Jr. would need to gather about 126,000 signatures to get on the ballot.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/08/23/crowds-react-to-rfk-jr-s-stops-in-greenville-spartanburg-trump-biden-kennedy-democrats-republicans/70639898007/", "title": "RFK Jr stops in SC: Democratic presidential candidate intrigues ...", "text": "Robert F.

Kempczinski described it as \"a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald’s but its own unique personality.\"\n\nIt seems the company plans to lean into the space-based, futurism-of-the-past aesthetic associated with CosMc's character from the late '80s and early '90s.

In an email, McDonald's told USA TODAY that eager fans can expect to see the doors open this week.\n\nMcDonald's plans to open approximately 10 CosMc’s pilot locations by the end of 2024.\n\nCosMc's:McDonald's reveals locations for chain's new spinoff restaurant and menu\n\nCosMc's locations\n\nMcDonald's had not revealed exact locations for the rest of the rollout beyond the inaugural Bolingbrook, Illinois store. According to the announcement, patrons in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio metro areas can expect to see more locations popping up in the coming months.\n\nWho is the character CosMc?\n\nAs previously reported by USA TODAY, CosMc hasn't appeared in the McDonald's universe in more than 30 years.\n\nAs previously described, a 1987 commercial called \"The Story of CosMc,\" is available via the YouTube archives and includes Ronald McDonald and Grimace, who come across a strange object that's landed in McDonaldland. Hands and a head clad in a silver suit pop out and CosMc (pronounced Cosmic) appears, saying he \"popped in from outer space on a trade mission.\"\n\nAfter making a series of perhaps undesired trades with the other characters to get his hands on a cheeseburger and some fries, CosMc is summoned back with a giant magnet by Ronald before settling in for a picnic with the others.\n\nA round, googly-eyed orange character, CosMc looks alien-like with two antennae placed on top of his head and a chrome space suit complete with multiple sets of arms sticking out of each side. He can even fly courtesy of his space suit.\n\nMcDonald's has yet to make clear if the mascot itself will return to restaurants as part of the concept launch.\n\nAdult Happy Meals are back:Kerwin Frost Box offers 6 new McNugget Buddies toys at McDonald's\n\nWhat is on the CosMc's menu?\n\nMcDonald's has not announced what will be on the CosMc's menu. However, Chicago-area real estate investor Iman Jalali claims to have captured images of a menu board outside an upcoming CosMc's in Illinois. The photos were shared on social media and obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nAccording to the photos, the drive-thru menu features teas and lemonades, coffees, slushies and frappes and signature fruit drinks called \"Galactic Boosts.\" Drinks like a Turmeric Spiced Latte, Churro Frappe and Sour Cherry Energy Burst are some of the items listed.\n\nFood items included a Spicy Queso Sandwich, a Creamy Avocado Tomatillo Sandwich, Pretzel Bites and Savory Hash Brown Bites. The list appears to also bring back all-day breakfast with classic items like the Egg McMuffin, Bacon McMuffin with Egg and Sausage McMuffin with Egg. Traditional McFlurry flavors also made an appearance.\n\nJalali said the photos were taken in Bolingbrook, a town roughly 30 miles outside of Chicago, where the first CosMc's is set to open. While passing by what was once a Boston Market, he noticed the shiny new four-lane drive-thru complete with digital menus. Interested to see more, Jalali said he approached the location to see a team of actors and cameras filming a commercial, meaning he was only able to snap a few photos from a distance.\n\nJalali was unable to glean any further information and McDonald's did not immediately respond to the request for comment from USA TODAY. It is unclear if all or any of the items on the board are intended to be served upon launch.\n\nReporting contributed by Mike Snider, USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/01/08/taco-bell-value-menu/72149445007/", "title": "Taco Bell value menu: See new food items, prices at fast food chain", "text": "Taco Bell is launching its new value menu, which offers 10 items for $3 or less and a new, vegetarian \"Build-Your-Own-Cravings-Box\".\n\nThe fast food chain is set to launch the new Cravings Value Menu on Thursday, Jan. 11, the company said in a news release.

The following contains details from \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story,\" which premiered Sept. 21.\n\nThe 10-part miniseries \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" (now streaming on Netflix) features a number of moments pulled from original reporting about the horrific murders perpetrated by Dahmer over several years and discovered in July 1991.\n\nWas everything in the show as it happened, or were some details glossed over a bit? As any fan of true-crime television will tell you, \"based on a true story\" can often mean a wide range of interpretation of the facts.\n\nThis particular series played things pretty faithfully to the reported information, though there were a couple notable story beats that diverted from reality.\n\nWith the guide of original reporting from the Milwaukee Journal and Milwaukee Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY NETWORK, as well as former Journal reporter Anne E. Schwartz's book on the topic (\"Monster: The True Story of the Jeffrey Dahmer Murders\"), here's a look at the facts and fiction of each episode.\n\nJeffrey Dahmer Netflix series:What we know about the show as Evan Peters stars as serial killer\n\nWarning: Some details may be unsettling to readers, and these details will reveal the events of the series.\n\nEpisode 1: 'Episode One'\n\nGlenda Cleveland didn't live in the Oxford Apartments building\n\nOne of the biggest changes to real events is the character of Glenda Cleveland (Niecy Nash). In the show, she lives adjacent to Jeffrey Dahmer (Evan Peters), who resides in apartment 213 in the Oxford Apartments on 25th Street in Milwaukee.\n\nThe real-life Cleveland lived in a building next door. It seems likely that the show attempted to amalgamate Cleveland and neighbor Pamela Bass into one character. It's Bass who said that Dahmer made sandwiches for others in the building, which becomes the subject of an unsettling exchange between the Dahmer and Cleveland characters later in the show.\n\nThe Milwaukee Police incident on the news might not have happened\n\nFor as many details as the show gets right, it makes some curious choices on its newscasts. The first words you hear in the series are from a television news program being watched by Cleveland, starting with, \"Five white police officers stand accused of beating a fellow officer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a Black man on undercover assignment,\" going on to indicate that the event happened during a traffic stop.\n\nIf that happened, we couldn't find any record of it, and certainly not in the months leading up to the 1991 arrest of Dahmer (which happens in subsequent scenes after this newscast is airing).\n\nThere was, however, an incident that fits the description that took place in Nashville, Tennessee, in December 1992.\n\nDahmer did show Tracy Edwards 'The Exorcist'\n\nDahmer indeed showed the movie \"The Exorcist\" to Tracy Edwards (Shaun J. Brown), the man who escaped Dahmer's apartment and later led police back to the scene where Dahmer was discovered (though in one interview he said it was \"The Exorcist III\"). Another of Dahmer's preferred movies, \"Return of the Jedi,\" is also mentioned in the series.\n\nHow many locks were on Dahmer's door?\n\nThe episode chronicles the night of July 22, 1991, when Dahmer was captured after 32-year-old Tracy Edwards escaped his apartment and flagged down police. Edwards is shown on the show fiddling with the locks and trying to escape, which actually became a point of contention in real life.\n\nEdwards' story changed throughout the aftermath of Dahmer's arrest, including appearances on talk shows in which he talked about the numerous locks on the door, while photos of the scene showed only two.\n\nThe other evidence police find in the apartment during the episode, from the painted skulls to the heads in the refrigerator, were real details from the scene.\n\nEpisode 2: 'Please don't go'\n\nMilwaukee police officers did return victim Konerak Sinthasomphone to Dahmer, then radioed about needing to be 'deloused'\n\n\"Ten-four. It'll be a minute, my partner's gonna get deloused at the station.\"\n\nThey are the words of officer John Balcerzak, who reported to the Oxford Apartments with partner Joseph Gabrish on May 27, 1991, for an encounter that would become a major wedge between the Milwaukee citizenry and its leaders.\n\nAfter infamously returning Dahmer victim Konerak Sinthasomphone to Dahmer — the killer had convinced the cops that the disoriented 14-year-old was actually his 19-year-old lover who'd had too much to drink — the officers returned to their car and radioed in. They later reported that the smell they observed in the apartment resembled someone recently using the bathroom and not something more sinister, and \"deloused\" was a word emphasized by critics as an indication of law enforcement's flippant or recoiling attitude toward the gay community.\n\nBoth officers, as well as a third who assisted (Rick Porubcan) were suspended once Dahmer's murders were discovered, including five more after that night. The two were fired by police chief Philip Arreola, then reinstated by a judge in 1994 and continued a long career in law enforcement.\n\nDahmer indeed stole a mannequin from a department store\n\nIt was a Boston Store — a now-defunct Milwaukee-based chain.\n\nDahmer did get angry about tadpoles he gave a teacher\n\nThe episode pulled a real-life anecdote from Dahmer's childhood, when he became upset when the tadpoles he gifted a teacher were handed off to a friend. Even more sinister than the show portrayed, Dahmer said he angrily went to the friend's house and killed the tadpoles by pouring motor oil into their jar.\n\nDahmer was convicted for sexually assaulting the brother of one of his future victims\n\nDahmer was convicted of sexual assault of a minor — Sinthasomphone's brother — in 1988. This has largely been regarded as a horrifying coincidence. On the show, he buys Konerak beer from a convenience store and doesn't make the connection between the two brothers when Konerak brings it up. Dahmer in real life said he met Konerak at Grand Avenue Mall.\n\nEpisode 3: 'Doin' a Dahmer'\n\nOhio police let Dahmer go with damning evidence in the back seat\n\nDahmer revealed in his testimony that in 1978, after killing his first victim at age 18 (Steven Hicks), he was pulled over near his Ohio hometown with garbage bags in the backseat that contained Hicks' remains.\n\nThough he was swerving and pulled over at 3 a.m., Dahmer convinced the officers to let him drive off. This interaction is portrayed in the episode.\n\nHe eventually stored the body and disposed of it two years later after returning from military duty, scattering the remains all over the yard of his parents' home.\n\nInvestigators found the remains in late 1991.\n\nDahmer's jogger story is partially accurate\n\nDahmer in real life did say that he became fascinated with an area jogger and thought about attacking him with a baseball bat, though it doesn't appear he ever did, vowing that if the jogger came by again, he'd finally act (but the jogger never came back).\n\nIn the show, Dahmer winds up stalking the jogger and approaching him aggressively with the bat but then bringing the jogger back to his house for a drink — an interaction that is revealed to be a fantasy.\n\nDahmer did pose with the Honor Society for yearbook photo, even though he wasn't in the group\n\nIt's true that Dahmer once posed in his school's honor society yearbook photo even though he didn't belong to the organization. His face was blacked out, just as it was portrayed on the show.\n\nEpisode 4: 'The good boy box'\n\nDahmer did work at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center but didn't drink bags of blood\n\nOne scene on the show shows Dahmer getting a job as a phlebotomist at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center and bringing a bag of blood home to drink.\n\nThe real-life incident Dahmer described to law enforcement was less gory but also more daring.\n\nDahmer said he tried a vial of blood to see how it tasted and did so on the roof of the center. Dahmer said he spit the blood out on the rooftop.\n\nYes, Dahmer was arrested for indecent exposure at the Wisconsin State Fair and was kicked out of a bathhouse\n\nHis fine was $50 for the former offense and he was accused by the manager of drugging two patrons in the latter incident. The manager later testified at Dahmer's trial.\n\nDahmer said he killed his first Milwaukee victim at the Ambassador Hotel\n\nAs portrayed on the show, Steven Tuomi (Dahmer's first victim in Milwaukee) was murdered at the Ambassador Hotel, though Dahmer was never forthcoming with details about that night, saying that he'd blacked out. It's portrayed that way on the show.\n\nDahmer was not officially charged with Tuomi's death because no remains were ever recovered, though Dahmer did describe parts of the encounter.\n\nOpinion:From texting suicide to child murder, Hollywood should stay away from some true crime\n\nEpisode 5: 'Blood on their hands'\n\nRon Flowers' close call\n\nIn Schwartz's book, Dahmer said he didn't eventually decide to kill Ron Flowers — a man he led back to his grandmother's house in West Allis and drugged — because Flowers weighed 250 pounds and Dahmer wasn't sure he could move the body.\n\nThe Ron Flowers in the show (Dyllón Burnside) isn't that imposing, but he does get saved thanks to vigilant attention from Catherine Dahmer (Michael Learned). It's unclear if she was as hands-on in real life as she was in the show.\n\nJust as in real life, Dahmer had offered to give Flowers a lift after Flowers' car broke down. Flowers remembered going back to the house and then waking up in a hospital, and he believed he'd been assaulted (the show doesn't include this). Police did question Dahmer afterward but found Dahmer's story to be credible.\n\nTV news reports share odd information\n\nAgain, the TV news reports in the background are interesting; one mentions a house fire in Stafford (a community that does not exist) and another cites the Allis-Chalmers plant shutting down its tractor operation by the end of the year. Allis-Chalmers closed in 1985 before the events depicted.\n\nDahmer was sentenced to spend a year in the House of Correction, which was more casual than depicted\n\nThe correctional facility in Milwaukee where Dahmer was sentenced to spend a year looks like a jail on the show, but it's more of a \"dormitory\" setup in real life according to Schwartz.\n\nJudge William Gardner received much more attention in real life than on the show\n\nGardner received significant criticism for this leniency in sentencing Dahmer for the sexual assault of a minor, though he doesn't wind up emphasized in the series.\n\nIt's unclear if he indeed struggled with the patriarch Sounthone Sinthasomophone's broken English and asked that he enlist one of his children as a translator (as was the case on the show). Schwartz's book indicates that the family wasn't even present at the sentencing hearing because no one had informed them it was happening.\n\nDonna Chester, a probation officer who had appointments with Dahmer during his killing spree and never grew wise to his murders, also received widespread criticism but does not appear in the show.\n\nEpisode 6: 'Silenced'\n\nTony Hughes and Dahmer knew each other for more than a year, according to a witness\n\nThe show ostensibly set out to tell a tale about the victims and those who unwittingly allowed Dahmer's crimes to continue, but this is the first episode that spends prolonged time with characters other than Dahmer.\n\nTony Hughes first met Dahmer in 1989. The deaf man and Dahmer are shown in this episode having a lengthy relationship, at least by the show's standards.\n\nThe real-life Dahmer said in his confession that he never met Hughes before the night he was murdered, but a friend of Hughes' told police that Dahmer and Hughes had been friendly for more than a year, coming to her house six times from October 1989 to December 1990 looking for Hughes.\n\nAnother friend verified they knew each other for two years before Hughes became a victim.\n\nMilwaukee newspapers reported on Hughes' disappearance after he went missing, before the Dahmer discovery.\n\nDahmer did call family members of his victims\n\nHe menacingly told them to stop looking for their loved ones, as portrayed in the show.\n\nEpisode 7: 'Cassandra'\n\nGlenda Cleveland did repeatedly follow up with Milwaukee police about her suspicions\n\nGlenda Cleveland, who witnessed the May encounter between Dahmer, Sinthasomphone and police, did follow up repeatedly, believing Sinthasomphone was a younger child and not a 19-year-old. She called again after she saw a story in the newspaper about Sinthasomphone going missing, recognizing him from that night.\n\nPolice did not act on her suspicions, and she called the FBI, which decided it did not have jurisdiction. Seven weeks went by before Dahmer was arrested.\n\nIn the show, Cleveland said she was making calls for \"months and months.\"\n\nCleveland did get to meet the Rev. Jesse Jackson in Milwaukee\n\nCleveland was eventually hailed by the city as an example of citizen action, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson came to Milwaukee to highlight the double standard in how law enforcement looked at Black and white citizens, where Cleveland did get to meet him, as she did in the show.\n\nTenants in the Oxford Apartments did complain about the smell and did hear screams\n\nThe manager spoke to Dahmer about the issue at least three times, though it's unclear if he was threatened with eviction as he was on the show.\n\nThe manager even helped Dahmer clean out a freezer at one point in an attempt to alleviate the aroma.\n\nBut as mentioned above, there's no indication Cleveland and Dahmer ever met, so the menacing exchange in which Dahmer insists she eat a sandwich he gave her probably didn't happen.\n\nCleveland died in 2011 and never moved from 25th street.\n\nEpisode 8: 'Lionel'\n\nThe families' testimonies are nearly word-for-word from court transcripts, and they're the most effective part of the show\n\nIt wouldn't be surprising to see this show draw criticism for falling short of providing a greater story to the families of victims.\n\nThe most effective scene in the series comes toward the end of this episode, when family members are able to speak in court how Dahmer's murders have impacted them. The speeches are almost word-for-word from actual transcripts, but unfortunately, we haven't spent enough time with these people to get a sense of their stories.\n\nThat includes a passionate demonstration of rage from Rita Isbell (DaShawn \"Dash\" Barnes), the sister of victim Errol Lindsey. Isbell really did attempt to lunge across the table to attack Dahmer in the trial.\n\nA representative from the Isbell family questioned the purpose of another re-telling of the Dahmer story with the Netflix release.\n\nLionel Dahmer did petition Judge Gardner to keep his son locked up\n\nMuch of the show focuses on the complicated relationship between Lionel Dahmer (Richard Jenkins) and his son. It's true that Lionel petitioned judge William Gardner to not release Dahmer, believing he needed treatment for alcohol and his other urges, something Dahmer did not receive during his stay in the correctional facility while serving his sentence for sexual assault.\n\nThere was a Jeffrey Dahmer comic book in 1992\n\nOn the show, Dahmer acknowledges that he'd heard of another notorious Wisconsin serial killer, \"Butcher of Plainfield\" Ed Gein, through a comic book. It's unclear if there really was an Ed Gein comic book that Dahmer read when he was younger (there's definitely a graphic novel today), but the Jeffrey Dahmer comic book shown in the series was real, to the horror of family members, in 1992.\n\nEpisode 9: 'The Bogeyman'\n\nMilwaukee police officers Balcerzak and Gabrish did not receive 'Officer of the Year'\n\nOne of the show's biggest inventions, a brief scene shows the two police officers at the center of the feud between citizens and law enforcement — John Balcerzak and Joseph Gabrish — receive an \"officer of the year\" commendation.\n\nThat never happened, though both were reinstated to their jobs in 1994, with back pay, and Balcerzak later became president of the Milwaukee police officers union.\n\nCleveland was, however, formally honored by the Common Council and County Board, and mayor John Norquist called her a model citizen. Her recognition is portrayed in the show.\n\nWe couldn't find information on Sandra Smith's arrest\n\nIn the show, Sandra Smith (the daughter of Glenda Cleveland) is arrested for assaulting a gawker and shattering his camera. We couldn't find record of that ever happening and it might be a show invention. The real-life Smith was present at the night the police returned Konerak Sinthasomphone to Dahmer.\n\nIt's true that the apartments were razed and nothing took their place\n\nThe Oxford Apartments were purchased for $325,000 by the Campus Circle Project, a public/private organization affiliated with Marquette University, and razed in 1992. Even today, the lot at 924 N. 25th Street is vacant, surrounded by a black fence.\n\nEpisode 10: 'God of Forgiveness, God of Vengeance'\n\nIn what might be seen as one of the series' flimsiest episodes, characters (including Dahmer) try moving on, with a theme of faith and forgiveness.\n\nChristopher Scarver, the convicted murderer who killed Dahmer and another inmate (Cedarburg murderer Jesse Anderson) at the Columbia Correctional Institution, is portrayed as someone seeking God's advice in how to deal with Dahmer.\n\nThe real-life Scarver has given testimony saying he believed he was a million years old. He also professed to be the son of God. So he may be prone to embellishment.\n\nInvestigators determined that prison staff were not culpable in the double murder. Two life sentences were added to Scarver's initial life sentence.\n\nBest fall TV:10 new shows to watch, from 'American Gigolo' to 'Andor'", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/living-well/ragbrai/2022/03/27/ragbrai-2022-route-camping-eating-sleeping-biking-guide-rookie/6706976001/", "title": "The rookie rider's guide to RAGBRAI: camping, eating, sleeping, biking", "text": "Hi, I’m Philip Joens. I rode my first RAGBRAI at age 8 in 2001. Now I cover retail, real estate and RAGBRAI for the Des Moines Register.

If you have questions that aren't answered, contact me at 515-284-8184, pjoens@registermedia.com or Twitter @Philip_Joens.\n\nWhat does RAGBRAI stand for?\n\nThe Register’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa.\n\nHow did it get started?\n\nIn 1973, Des Moines Register copy editor John Karras and Washington columnist Donald Kaul wanted to ride their bikes across Iowa. Ten-speed bikes were a relatively new thing then and fitness fads were all the rage. So they convinced their bosses to let them ride across Iowa and have the newspaper pay for it if they wrote stories along the way.\n\nA crowd of 200 riders joined them for what was billed The Great Six-Day Bike Trip. It was such a hit that they did it every year after that, adding a day and renaming it RAGBRAI. Now it's a professionally run event with a full-time, year-round staff.\n\nThis year's overnight, starting and ending towns mark the 50th anniversary of the ride with a roughly similar Sioux City-to-Davenport route.\n\nRAGBRAI 50th anniversary edition hews closely to original route, including stop in Des Moines\n\nIs RAGBRAI a race?\n\nNo. It's a recreational ride for everyone.\n\nHow many days is it?\n\nSeven days on the road. But riders who go the whole week try to get to the starting town on the Saturday before the first riding day. The party starts there and a bike expo is held.\n\nHow is RAGBRAI different from other state tours?\n\nIt’s bigger. No other bike tour has as many riders and entertainment options as RAGBRAI.\n\nREGISTRATION\n\nHow do I register?\n\nIn 2022 RAGBRAI ended its long-held lottery system. Now registration is first-come, first-served online. Weeklong riders can register, as can riders who want to ride just one or a few days. Non-rider passes also are available for support drivers and others.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nWeeklong registration is $225 and increases to $250 on April 15. It costs $300 at the RAGBRAI Bike Expo in Sioux City.\n\nWeeklong non-rider registration costs $45 and increases to $50 April 15. It costs $50 at the RAGBRAI Bike Expo in Sioux City.\n\nDay passes cost $50 and the costs increases to $60 on April 15. Day passes can be bought on RAGBRAI for $70.\n\nWhen is the deadline to register?\n\nRegular registration closes May 15, but weeklong wristbands, non-rider wristbands and day passes can be bought on RAGBRAI.\n\nDo I have to register my support vehicle?\n\nYes. All drivers must register as weeklong nonriders, with the driver’s name, license plate number, make and model of the car. Only registered vehicles can enter campgrounds. Vehicle passes can be purchased while registering.\n\nWhy should I register?\n\nRegistration covers the costs of putting together the route and holding the event. Registration also guarantees riders will have access to four ambulances and paramedic teams on the route each day.\n\nIn addition, registration covers:\n\nThe cost of Iowa State Patrol Troopers to control traffic on roads.\n\nSAG (support and gear) van service in the event of mechanical breakdowns or medical issues.\n\nDiscounts from food vendors and bike shops along the route.\n\nAccess to reserved vehicle parking spots in towns along the route.\n\nA patch for registered riders.\n\nAccess to concerts in overnight towns.\n\nCan I ride if I don’t register?\n\nTechnically, yes. RAGBRAI is held on public roads with the help of public agencies. So organizers cannot kick a “bandit” out. But unregistered riders don't get SAG service and will be stuck with a separate bill for any medical emergencies involving an ambulance ride.\n\nHow do I register if I did not get a wristband before registration closes?\n\nFor the first time, riders can buy weeklong registration at the RAGBRAI Bike Expo on July 22, the day before the ride starts, in the starting town, Sioux City. Wristbands can also be bought second-hand on RAGBRAI forums. Especially in the weeks before RAGBRAI, the forums are full of people selling wristbands because of injuries or schedule conflicts.\n\nThe RAGBRAI Newbies Facebook Page and RAGBRAI L Facebook Page also are great resources and may have postings for wristband sales before RAGBRAI.\n\nHow do I sign up for parking in Sioux City or Davenport?\n\nThe starting and ending towns coordinate with one another and information will be posted. Cost and location of long-term parking options will be linked on the town pages on RAGBRAI.com in May.\n\nWhat to know about the RAGBRAI's 2023 starting, ending and overnight towns\n\nWhen will the vehicle route be released?\n\nRAGBRAI releases the vehicle route in July. Printed copies will be available at the Driver Safety Meeting before RAGBRAI's start in Sergeant Bluff. Maps also will be available at merchandise trailers, which are always downtown in overnight towns, and in meeting towns each day on the route.\n\nHow do I go without a team?\n\nAll registered riders get baggage service and access to the Des Moines Register’s campground.\n\nShould I sign up with a charter or a team?\n\nMost people do, if they can arrange it and afford it. Teams offer the camaraderie of having people with shared interests to hang out with. Many recruit new members. Charter services like Pork Belly Ventures, Brancel’s and Bike World also provide meals, showers and tent rental and setup, in addition to hauling baggage. In addition, they may shuttle you back to a parked car at the ride starting point, or even from your hometown and back.\n\nFrom the route to registration, here’s everything you need to know about RAGBRAI 2023\n\nRAGBRAI LORE\n\nWhat is a RAGBRAI Virgin?\n\nFirst-time RAGBRAI riders are called “RAGBRAI virgins.” In true silly bike ride tradition, RAGBRAI Virgins write “Virgin” on their calves at the start of the week. People like to tease the virgins because, you know — it's their first time.\n\nMore:Why do RAGBRAI cyclists ride across Iowa? For some it's a memory while for others, an adventure\n\nCan I ride RAGBRAI alone?\n\nOf course. You’ll be surrounded by 12,000 riders. Most people are approachable. By the end of the week you could make lifelong friends or even meet a potential spouse.\n\nDid you say 'meet your spouse'?\n\nRAGBRAI marriages happen all the time.\n\nWhy do people dip their tires in the Missouri and Mississippi rivers?\n\nRiders dip their back tires in the Missouri River, or one of its tributaries, to signify the start of the ride and then dip their front tires in the Mississippi River to signify the end of the ride.\n\nEnding towns in eastern Iowa always are right on the Mississippi River. Starting towns in western Iowa do not always have Missouri River shoreline. Riders often settle for dipping their tires in a Missouri tributary, a provided tub of river water, or just skip the tradition.\n\nThis year, however, the starting town, Sioux City, sits right on the Missouri River, with a new and inviting riverfront park.\n\nCAMPING\n\nWhere do you sleep during RAGBRAI?\n\nIf you’re asking this question now you’ll likely need to camp.\n\nA few lucky people get hotel rooms along the route. Most of those are booked within minutes of the route’s announcement. Some people book hotels in all 99 Iowa counties before the route is announced, then cancel reservations for rooms they don’t need.\n\nSome people rent rooms in the homes of local residents in the overnight towns.\n\nWhat type of tent should I use?\n\nGenerally, cheap tents are fine. I used a $25 tent from Walmart for years until it broke.\n\nPeople think of every way imaginable to stay comfortable while camping on RAGBRAI. Baggage drivers often sleep in their trucks. Some people throw blankets in the grass. I was on a team where the baggage driver rigged a hammock under the truck each night.\n\nHow should I know what pack?\n\nSearch YouTube for videos about how to pack for RAGBRAI. Or watch this video created by Register photographer Brian Powers and Kathy Murphy from the “Just Go Bike” and “Murphology” podcasts.\n\nHere's my 2018 packing list:\n\nTent.\n\nSleeping bag and two fleece blankets (to form a mattress).\n\nTwo pillows.\n\nSleeping blindfold.\n\nEar plugs.\n\nCell phone/charger.\n\nCell phone battery backup.\n\nStanding tire pump.\n\nGranola bars for the morning.\n\nSunglasses.\n\nSunscreen.\n\nBike/bike gear.\n\nSandals.\n\nTennis shoes.\n\nToiletries.\n\nRain jacket.\n\nStocking cap.\n\nGloves.\n\nLong-sleeved shirt.\n\nTent fan.\n\nDome light.\n\nTowel.\n\nSwimsuit.\n\nMy parents bring an air mattress. They even have a toilet for their tent.\n\nSome riders pack way more. Others pack way less. A few ride self-contained. The more I ride RAGBRAI, the more I think less is more. Cycling is about utilitarianism. For me more stuff is unnecessary and just makes getting from place to place harder.\n\nWill it be uncomfortably hot at night when I'm trying to sleep?\n\nYep. Temperatures can exceed 100 degrees during the day and may not fall much below 80 some night. Bring a tent fan!\n\nWill it get cold?\n\nIt can by summer standards. On July 27, 2018, when RAGBRAI was in Iowa City, Des Moines had a low temperature of 57 degrees. Dew in the morning often makes it feel cooler.\n\nThe long-sleeved shirt, stocking cap and gloves I threw into my baggage at the last minute saved me from a week of shiveringly cold nights.\n\nWhat's the normal temperature?\n\nThe National Weather Service says an average July day in Des Moines, the fourth overnight town this year, has a high of 85 degrees and a low of 66 degrees.\n\nMore:What you need to know about weather predictions before riding across Iowa on RAGBRAI\n\nAre the bugs bad in Iowa?\n\nMosquitos, chiggers and other critters can be abundant in July. Bring bug spray. I usually forget that.\n\nWhere should I go if it storms?\n\nEvery RAGBRAI town has emergency plans in place. Towns have designated storm shelters for every campground. The locations are published online.\n\nBe sure to know where to seek safety. RAGBRAI is held in the last week of July, typically one of the hottest, most humid and most active weather weeks of the year in Iowa. Thunderstorms, both on the route and in overnight towns, are common, and at least one rider has died when a tree fell on a tent.\n\nShould I bring earplugs?\n\nI do. Crowded campgrounds have all types of noises: port-a-potties clanking shut in the middle of the night, cars, trains, drunks yelling and generators running.\n\nHow do I know when to get up?\n\nWhen it sounds like a NASCAR pit stop outside as people unzip their tents.\n\nWhy is the cell service so poor on RAGBRAI?\n\nPhone companies provide cell booster towers during the week, but cell towers in rural areas, like the ones on the route this year, get overwhelmed.\n\nSo how do people communicate?\n\nBy praying their texts get through — and setting times to meet people at specific places, like libraries or town halls. Or by carrying whistles or duck calls or making some other code sound so they can find members of their teams when they reach towns.\n\nOn the way into overnight towns, teams place signs directing members to their campgrounds.\n\nHYGIENE\n\nWhere do I go to the bathroom?\n\nMost often in porta-potties. (Some old-school riders still refer to porta-potties as “Kybos”, which was a brand of port-a-potty on RAGBRAI in the 1980s.) Every official RAGBRAI campground has at least a couple Kybos. Some teams even rent their own Kybos and get surly when other people use them. Pass-through towns also have Kybos on the route. Some vendors on the route get their own Kybos.\n\nSometimes you’ll be lucky enough to find a bar, restaurant or library with an indoor toilet available, but those are luxuries.\n\nAre cornfields bathrooms?\n\nCornfields are good places to take nature breaks. Make sure to wander in far enough that people don’t see your thingamabobs.\n\nWhere should I not go to the bathroom?\n\nIn the yards of residents. You are guests in these communities. Be respectful!\n\nWhere can I shower?\n\nMany teams haul their own showers on trailers and set them up in rows at campgrounds or on streets. Other teams use Coleman tent showers. Shower bags are common sights.\n\nShower vendors like Joe’s Wet Shack sometimes set up in overnight towns. Showers also are usually available for a fee at high schools, pools and local gyms.\n\nOr find a hose and soap up. Just keep your underwear on.\n\nDo cyclists need to shave their legs?\n\nProfessional and amateur racers shave their legs because it prevents hair follicles from sticking on pavement during crashes. Shaving also makes crash wounds easier to treat.\n\nOn recreational rides and RAGBRAI I find that shaving make it easier to clean grime off my legs, apply sunscreen and clean cuts and nicks.\n\nRIDING THE ROUTE\n\nWhat time is the route open?\n\n6 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\nCan I leave before sunrise without a light?\n\nNope. Iowa law requires bike operators to have headlights and tail lights visible from at least 300 feet away. Riders who try to leave when it’s pitch black will be stopped by state troopers unless they have lights.\n\nHow fast do people go?\n\nAs fast as they want. Some serious riders lick the route so quickly they go out for more miles. Other riders like to drink beer and take their time. Some people just need to go slowly. Ride at the pace that fits your ability and agenda.\n\nMore:Register database puts 50 years of facts about RAGBRAI towns at your fingertips\n\nWhat is the proper route etiquette?\n\nThe left lane is for passing and fast riders. Watch out for pace lines, which often move faster than 20 mph.\n\nYell “stopping” and use the bike stopping signal (extended left arm bent at a 90-degee angle, palm facing to the rear) to signal to other riders you are stopping, and do not cut other riders off.\n\nYell “turning” to signal to other riders you are about to make a turn. With hundreds of bikes approaching turns at the same time, even basic turns on RAGBRAI can be tricky.\n\nYell “rumbles” when approaching rumble strips.\n\nDo not cut riders off when getting back on the road.\n\nWhat happens if I crash?\n\nRAGBRAI pays for ambulances to follow the ride. You also will see EMS clinicians on motorcycles.\n\nWhether a person is registered makes a big difference in the costs they may incur if injured. RAGBRAI covers ambulance services for registered riders and their bikes are taken to the next overnight town. Non-registered riders are billed for ambulance trips and their bikes are left where ambulances pick them up.\n\nAre there bike repair shops on the route?\n\nYes. Even where there isn't a permanent store, bike repair shops from elsewhere set up along the route. Most have basic bike necessities like tire tubes, parts and accessories for basic and sometimes complex fixes.\n\nWhat is a SAG wagon?\n\nSupport-and-gear, or SAG, wagons are vans that pick up riders who must end their rides early on a given day because of mechanical or medical problems, or just plain fatigue.\n\nHow do I request to be picked up by a SAG wagon?\n\nTurn your bike upside down on the left side of the road. For the first time on this year's ride, there will be designated SAG pickup spots in every meeting town.\n\nWhat is a meeting town?\n\nA meeting town is a pass-through town where teams can meet up with their riders to provide support on the route. Usually it is the biggest pass-through town and is near the center of the route for the day.\n\nWhere can I cool off?\n\nUsually landowners don’t mind if cyclists take naps in the shade on their roadside property. The best nap spots, though, are cemeteries, where the resident are unperturbed, and libraries. Town squares in overnight towns can be comfortable places to listen to music and grab a quick snooze.\n\nPonds, rivers and lakes also are popular. Take a few minutes to splash around.\n\nAre rumble strips dangerous?\n\nNot usually. If you hit them perpendicularly they’re usually fine to ride over. Some rumble strips are deeper than others, can feel uncomfortable and even may buck inattentive riders off their bikes. Narrow road bike tires can get stuck in deep-cut rumble strips if riders aren't paying attention when they hit them.\n\nShould I swerve in front of other riders to avoid hitting rumble strips?\n\nNO! Don't risk cutting off other riders.\n\nWhat kind of bike can I use?\n\nEvery type of bike imaginable is on RAGBRAI. That's why I call RAGBRAI “Bikestock.”\n\nMost riders use road bikes, but heavier mountain bikes are far more popular than they once were. them\n\nFat-tire bikes have a cult following, and there's now a whole day with an alternate route for gravel riders, who have their own specialized cycles. And the hundreds of recumbent riders could form their own sizable ride. Tandems are everywhere. Electric-assist bikes are becoming more popular.\n\nA few unicyclists always ride RAGBRAI. Usually at least a few people ride elliptical bikes. There are always nonchyclists, too: roller bladers and longboarders, and recently some ultra-marathon runners.\n\nWhat does 'car up' mean?\n\nRAGBRAI riders take up both lanes of two-lane highways. “Car up” means move over to the right lane so traffic can pass.\n\nWhat does 'car back' mean?\n\nThe same thing as “car up” but with a car coming from behind. In many ways this can be trickier because riders do not see the car coming.\n\nHow can I play my tunes on my bike?\n\nI play music on my bike using a shotgun shell-sized Buckshot 2.0 speaker. Many riders carry larger speakers or boom boxes. Communication with other riders is important, so do not wear headphones.\n\nCan I bring a dog on my bike?\n\nIf Lassie loves riding in a bike trailer or can fit in a handlebar bag, bring her!\n\nBut I’m a cat person\n\nBring them! Target has a cat carrier backpack for $40. Petco has a higher-quality cat carrier for $80.\n\nMore:RAGBRAI's luckiest kitten\n\nHow are the man-eating dogs on the route?\n\n“I don’t know, but we’ll all find out together,” RAGBRAI co-founder Karras wrote in response to this question in a May 19, 1974, column.\n\nI keep hearing the term 'Karras Loop.' What is it?\n\nFrom 1973 to 1985, RAGBRAI always had a mandatory \"Century Day\" of 100 miles or longer. In 1986 the century became a one-day option. In 2001 it was renamed the \"Karras loop\" to honor Karras, who would station himself somewhere along the loop to hand out commemorative patches.\n\nIn 2022 RAGBRAI made the century day mandatory on the fourth day to honor Karras after his death in November 2021. But it a one-time event. The century option this year will be on the third day, as the ride goes from Carroll to Ames.\n\nRAGBRAI riders push through Century Day's 105-mile challenge: 'It was something a lot of us never thought we could do'\n\nWhere do support drivers drive?\n\nOn a support vehicle route. Usually the vehicle route is on major highways while the ride sticks to secondary roads and interstates.\n\nFOOD AND DRINK\n\nWhat do I eat?\n\nLocal restaurants are the hidden gems of RAGBRAI, worth searching out. Great Mexican restaurants with cold lemonade are my favorite finds.\n\nMost overnight towns have at least one burger, Mexican or Chinese restaurant. Pass-through towns often are big enough that they have local restaurants, too.\n\nChurches, veterans groups and other organizations in overnight towns also hold pasta feed fundraisers. And during the week, vendors follow the caravan, selling everything from stir fry to barbecue, gyros and pizza.\n\nAre there places to buy groceries at reasonable prices?\n\nMost overnight towns have grocery stores and many pass-through towns have convenience stores offering packaged and hot food at reasonable prices.\n\nWhere do I get food and water in the middle of the countryside?\n\nLocal and traveling vendors set up each day on roads along the route. Often kids sell water bottles for $1 or $2.\n\nNonprofits, local residents and groups promoting certain causes frequently give out free water bottles in pass-through towns or on the route These can be congestion points as people veer to the side of the road to grab bottles, so be careful when you spot them.\n\nSome of the most popular vendors along the route are:\n\nMr. Pork Chop, a RAGBRAI staple that sells pit-cooked pork chops on the roadside.\n\nSay Cheese, a grilled cheese vendor. Its grilled cheese, tomato and bacon sandwich is consistently one of the best things on RAGBRAI. That with an ice cold Coke (sugar and caffeine help performance) are a perfect combo.\n\nThe Iowa Craft Beer Tent is a favorite among riders.\n\nBeakman’s Ice Cream, which dishes out fresh scoops from gas-powered ice cream makers.\n\nWhere can I find pie?\n\nUsually on roadside tables in pass-through towns, made by local church members or other groups as fundraisers.\n\nIs there free water?\n\nOvernight towns are required to have free water in each campground. Most pass-through towns also have water bottle filling stations. Look for them as you depart pass-through towns.\n\nBefore RAGBRAI I fill 30 plastic bags with 3 tablespoons apiece of Gatorade mix to last me for the week. Then I make bottles of Gatorade at water filling stations.\n\nCOSTS\n\nShould I bring cash or credit cards?\n\nBoth. Far more vendors on RAGBRAI take credit cards now than they did 10 to 15 years ago, but cash is still essential. Bring smaller denominations like $20 bills to make it easier for vendors to give change.\n\nHow much money should I expect to spend during the week?\n\nI bring $300 in cash and keep $40 to $60 on me as I ride each day. Usually I spend less than $200 during the week.\n\nWhere should I store extra cash?\n\nToiletry bags are good places to hide cash if they're packed away in suitcases. Or store extra cash in a securely locked suitcase.\n\nENTERTAINMENT\n\nAre there places to party?\n\nAlcohol will not be in short supply.\n\nIs there family entertainment?\n\nGenerally RAGBRAI’s entertainment is geared more toward adults than kids. Every town has beer gardens. In a few towns the stage is in a beer garden, which can make family access problematic. But mechanical bulls with inflatable landing pits, face-painters, water slides and other family friendly entertainment are often seen on RAGBRAI. Most overnight towns have community pools that become popular spots for families and riders to cool off on hot days.\n\nTRAINING\n\nHow much should I train?\n\nA good rule of thumb is to ride the number of miles in RAGBRAI before RAGBRAI. So ride at least 500 miles This summer before going. That's about 41 miles per week if you start in May, but you'll want to work up to longer rides. I ride at least one ride of at least 100 miles before RAGBRAI for fun.\n\nWhere can I get training advice?\n\nRAGBRAI.com has more training info and a training plan PDF document (click the text to view and download) that you can print and use as a handy reference.\n\nCycling coach David Ertl has worked with RAGBRAI for years and coaches the Des Moines Cycle Club Race Team. He provides cycling training plans and ebooks at his website, CyclesportCoaching.com.\n\nRemember, RAGBRAI is a vacation. So get lost in its world while riding for a week. Be respectful, be patient and be safe. Like anything, RAGBRAI carries its risks, but the vast majority of riders have a great time and come back for more.\n\nWhere can I find more information for newbies?\n\nThe JustGoBike Podcast will release RAGBRAI 101 episodes starting in June. Its creators will also post recaps of each day of of the route inspection ride during the first week of June at Soundcloud.com/JustGoBike.\n\nGot a question? Call me at 515-284-8184, email me at pjoens@registermedia.com or follow me Twitter @Philip_Joens and send me a direct message.\n\nPhilip Joens covers retail, real estate and RAGBRAI for the Des Moines Register.

They were “just a few of the many people that have had their lives altered forever because of the events of early Tuesday morning.”\n\nThe shooting is under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, and Anderson is on leave, Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said Tuesday at a news conference.\n\nThe case follows a spate of deadly, controversial police encounters with Black Americans that have sparked protests nationwide, including in Columbus, where a series of killings by law enforcement have happened since 2020. The US Department of Justice has agreed to review the city’s Division of Police.\n\nThe shooting of Lewis happened around 2 a.m. Tuesday at an apartment building where uniformed officers were serving a felony warrant for domestic violence and assault and improper handling of a firearm, Bryant said. A news release by police indicated the man who was shot, later identified as Lewis, as the person sought in the felony warrant.\n\n“The officers knocked on the door for several minutes … acknowledging themselves as Columbus Police officers,” Bryant said.\n\nPolice body camera video shows them knocking and calling out to occupants repeatedly for more than eight minutes. They call for “Donovan” by name several times.\n\nEventually, a man came to the door and was detained by police, Bryant said. He told officers he’d been asleep, and they took a knife from his pocket. A second man inside the apartment was detained about a minute later.\n\nA screengrab from bodycam footage shows Columbus Police Officer Ricky Anderson and K9 moments before shooting and killing 20-year-old Donovan Lewis. WSYX/Columbus Police\n\nOfficers asked if anyone else was inside the apartment, Bryant said, but were unable to determine that, and Anderson and a K9 were then called in by Columbus Police to see if anyone else was inside.\n\n“Once the K9 officer arrived on the scene, additional announcements were made for anyone else inside to come out or the K9 was going to be released inside of the apartment,” Bryant said.\n\nIn the body camera video, the K9 is seen barking outside a back bedroom door, then officers enter the apartment and warn they are going to send a dog in.\n\nAn officer is seen opening the bedroom door, where a man is seen on a bed.\n\nBodycam video shows Anderson firing a single shot at a man, later identified as Lewis, moments after opening the bedroom door.\n\nDuring the news conference, Bryant showed the body camera video frame-by-frame, asserting that the moment Anderson opened fire, it appeared Lewis was holding “something” in his hand.\n\nA vape pen was later found next to Lewis on the bed, Bryant says.\n\nOnce Lewis was handcuffed, video shows, officers began rendering aid. Lewis was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:19 a.m., according to the Columbus Police statement.\n\nLewis’ death follows a string of other police shootings\n\nAttorneys for the officer expressed sympathy for Lewis’ family in a statement Thursday but said police officers “are forced to make split-second decisions in response to the actions of others.”\n\n“When we analyze police involved shootings, we must look to the totality of the circumstances and we are expressly forbidden from using 20/20 hindsight, because unlike all of us, officers are not afforded the luxury of armchair reflection when they are faced with rapidly evolving, volatile encounters in dangerous situations,” the statement by attorneys Mark Collins and Kaitlin Stephens said. “Because of this, the law allows a reasonable officer to be mistaken, just as the law allows us as non-police officers to be mistaken.”\n\n“We are sure the investigation will be thorough,” they said, “and we certainly hope the process of any future legal proceedings will be more fair than what we have seen in the recent past.”\n\nBryant, the police chief, said Tuesday officers are “put in compromising, potentially life-threatening situations” every day, “in which we are required to make split-second decisions.”\n\n“As the chief, it is my job to hold my officers accountable, but it’s also my job to offer them support and make sure that I give that to them through the process,” Bryant said. “If they do the right things for the right reasons, we will support them. If they do something wrong, they will be held accountable.”\n\nColumbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, left, and Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant speak to reporters about the shooting of Donovan Lewis. WBNS\n\nBut Elliott, the family’s attorney, called Lewis’ death “utterly senseless,” saying “excessive deadly force was recklessly used by officer Anderson when he shot and killed an unarmed Black man.”\n\n“How many more lives are going to be lost to this type of reckless activity? How many more young Black lives will be lost? How many more families like Donovan’s will need to appear in news conferences like this one,” Elliott asked Thursday, “before our leaders do enough to put a stop to these barbaric killings?”\n\nPrior incidents in Columbus that have spurred scrutiny of law enforcement include:\n\n• A Franklin County Sheriff’s Office deputy fatally shot Casey Goodson Jr. in December 2020 as the 23-year-old tried to enter his home with a Subway sandwich. The deputy was working for the US Marshals Service Fugitive Task Force looking for violent offenders at the time, police said, but Goodson, who was legally armed at the time, was not the person being sought. A grand jury indicted the deputy on two counts of murder and one count of reckless homicide.\n\n• Later that month, a Columbus police officer fatally shot Andre Hill as he walked toward the officer while holding an illuminated cell phone in his left hand, body camera footage showed. The officer in that case was fired and charged with murder, and the city council later voted to approve a $10 million settlement to Hill’s family, the largest in the city’s history.\n\n• Ma’Khia Bryant, 16, was killed in another shooting last April when Columbus police responded to her foster home, where Ma’Khia had been arguing with another young woman over a messy home and unmade bed. Police body camera video showed Ma’Khia lunge at the other woman with a knife, and a grand jury later declined to indict the officer who fired the fatal shot.\n\nLewis’ family has appreciated the community’s support so far, Elliott said, and asked that any gatherings or protests remain “peaceful and supportive and constructive.”\n\n“Reality is, if we don’t gather, and we don’t indicate how upsetting this is to all of us, we’re never going to see change,” the attorney said.", "authors": ["Amanda Musa Dakin Andone Michelle Watson", "Amanda Musa", "Dakin Andone", "Michelle Watson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2014/09/03/us-open-cheering-roger-federer/15031597/", "title": "Loss has writer cheering from press box at U.S. Open", "text": "Douglas Robson\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nNEW YORK – For once, I'm rooting at the U.S. Open.\n\nAs a reporter, we are schooled to maintain objectivity, and for good reason. Praise and criticism must flow equally for the subjects we cover, and snuggling too close can skew the facts, or at least the propensity to dig for them.\n\nI've covered professional tennis for a dozen years and have my go-to interviewees. I have players I prefer to watch for aesthetic or personal reasons. But I honestly don't have favorites. My mantra: If it's not going to be a great match, make it quick.\n\nThis year is different. I'm pulling for Roger Federer. Not for all the obvious reasons – the class, the flowing game, the agelessness, the authentic joie de vivre for everything tennis. I'm backing the 33-year-old Swiss because my mother, Margaret, adored him.\n\nMy parents met and wed in Chicago, where they started a family. Despite their peripatetic lives, it remained home. We weren't a tennis family in either passion or success like the McEnroes, Austins or Williamses, yet the sport resonated throughout our lives. We hosted lower-ranked pros with names like Trey Waltke and Rolf Thung and even Tracy Austin's older brother, John Austin, at our home in Washington DC, and Chicago when they were in town to play local tournaments. We all played, too, and one of my more excruciating childhood memories was enforced \"family doubles\" with my parents and older brother. Mixed doesn't begin to describe the complex feelings on the court.\n\nMy mother and I spent more than our fair share of time together. When I was a junior tennis player, she drove me to more tournaments than I dare to recall. In the summertime, we trudged around the Chicago area and other flat, muggy Midwest cities, sometimes with other kids in tow, sometimes just the two of us. We bonded. We battled. There were times when I refused to let her watch my matches, so she would hide behind trees to get a glimpse of what was going on. If I spotted her, I'd wave her away. Other times, I wanted her there to witness the triumph or the tragedy of the day's result so we could talk it out later.\n\nTo cheer me up after a loss, she would sometimes allow a stop at Wendy's for a chocolate Frosty. Ice cream in all its forms has remained a comfort food ever since. They weren't always easy times. I was a rambunctious kid on the way to adolescence and we were more or less stuck with each other. I remember the liberty – and the odd lonesomeness – when I got my driver's license and could travel to tournaments on my own.\n\nOn occasion, we'd travel to watch the Open. By dint of my father's corporate connections, we scored some fantastic seats for the penultimate day in 1984 when every match went the distance – the day that more or less gave birth to the U.S. Open's now defunct \"Super Saturday.\" I remember stumbling out with my parents and two college friends at what seemed like the middle of the night – it wouldn't register by today's wee-hour standards – and finding our way to Midtown Manhattan's Carnegie Deli for giant corned beef sandwiches. My mother, father and I rehashed the experience for years.\n\nBoth of my parents enjoyed playing for much of their married lives. At some point my mother quit playing. My father continued into his late sixties. My brother preferred to ski and skateboard, and for better or worse, I was impacted most. A late bloomer, I split my time between tennis and hockey but eventually became competent enough to reach national-level events. I went on to play Division I college tennis. Later, but not by design, I began covering the sport for a living.\n\nIn some of the last few years when I was working, my mother returned to the Open for a day or two. We rode the #7 subway out together. I would pop out for a quick lunch and she would head back up to the stands. She was thrilled when I once brought her into the press center, where she mingled with other journalists, viewed the main interview room and got an up-close look at how we live and work during the long days and nights at Flushing Meadows. She spoke about it for years and some of my colleagues even remember her brief visit. She left that kind of impression.\n\nI've felt her presence everywhere these last few days. The conversations we might have had about results. Who was playing well or looked vulnerable. What I was writing about. And Federer, her beloved Federer, or his arch-nemesis Rafael Nadal. Her interest was a welcome white noise during what I consider the toughest Grand Slam to cover.\n\nI never delved deeply into my mother's affection for Federer, who on Tuesday reached another quarterfinal in New York with a clinical defeat of Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut. I know she liked his comportment, his grace, his controlled aura of excellence. For whatever other reasons, he was her man. As in most of her life, my mother was nothing if not loyal -- often to a fault. If he was on TV, she often tried to catch him, especially during big tournaments. Especially during the U.S. Open.\n\nMy mother's life, of course, was hardly defined by tennis. She was a devoted wife and mother, and through her ample energies contributed to many civic activities, primarily in the fields of health, art, and historic preservation. She collected self-taught art. She loved a vodka straight up, with ice. She derived a ridiculous amount of pride in my work and my writing (apologies to everyone she badgered with my bylines.) She would have hated the idea of interrupting my reporting, but there was no getting around it when her health took a sudden turn for the worse.\n\nShe died on Aug. 24, the day before the U.S. Open began. She was 82.\n\nTennis is an individual sport. But it is also a game you cannot play alone. I was reminded of this again and again by the generous outpouring of love and support I received from family and friends during the past week, as well as many members of the \"tennis family\" I now inhabit. It would have put my mother, rest her soul, at ease.\n\nWhat can I say?

Turner secured a second term in 1989 but declined to run again when her term ended in 1991.\n\nBird-watching\n\nHundreds of bird species can be spotted here all throughout the year.

It is on a peninsula separated by Corpus Christi Bay, Oso Bay and the Laguna Madre. Flour Bluff actually got its name from pastry war between France and Mexico that occurred in 1838.\n\nBoat 'n Net\n\nSome love it, some hate it. This Corpus Christi staple has its pros and cons, but it is a staple for the city. You pull up to a wooden fixture, ring a doorbell and wait to shout your order through a large, long PVC pipe. Food includes fish, shrimp and chicken.\n\nBrockhampton Street\n\nLocated on the city's Southside, this street is best known for the name of the hip-hop group Brockhampton. Musician Clifford Ian Simpson, better known as Kevin Abstract, grew up on the street and dubbed his act with its name. In January, Brockhampton announced its disbandment.\n\nBuc Days\n\nThe Buccaneer Days festival is the annual celebration of bringing entertaining, educational and cultural events to the Coastal Bend since 1938. This culturally diverse event, held in the spring, includes a rodeo, two parades and a carnival.\n\nCandy Cane Lane\n\nEstablished in the early 1980s, Candy Cane Lane is the go-to spot for catching the spirit of the season during the winter holidays. More than 300 homes on Donegal and Killarmet drives have continued this tradition over the year with decked-out lights, free goodies and plenty of picture-perfect moments. Recently, one of the founders, Elain Barnes, passed away at 89.\n\nEva Longoria\n\nThe former 1987 Miss Corpus Christi USA and a Miller graduate, Eva Longoria is one of the A-list celebrities to come from the Sparkling City by the Sea.

Known best as Jill Munroe from \"Charlie's Angels,\" Fawcett was a graduate of Ray and was named \"Most Beautiful\" by her classmates all four years of high school. She passed away from anal cancer in 2009 at the age of 62.\n\nFishing\n\nFishing in Corpus Christi is a year-round activity by boat, kayak and on foot. All you need is a pole, bait and a fishing license to fit in. Plus, there's so many options to go fishing: Bob Hall Pier, San Jose Jetty, Sunset Lake, Laguna Shores Road and more.\n\nFive Points\n\nLocated in Calallen, Five Points is an area with the north and south points of Highway 77 used to pass through the intersection of FM 624, Up River Road and Hearne Road, creating a five-direction intersection. The Five Points Shopping Station and Shopping Center are the main hubs of the area.\n\nHooks\n\nCorpus Christi's minor league baseball team, owned by the Houston Astros, got its name due to the city's association with fishing.

Since then, the Hooks have moved from city to city before claiming the Sparkling City by the Sea its home.\n\nHooks baseball:Four new Hooks players to watch after recent roster moves\n\nHurricanes\n\nIf you're not from Corpus Christi, you wouldn't know that the city has hot and very humid summers with mild and very short winters. Hurricane season, June 1 through November 30, is an annual time where citizens prep for the rare occasion a storm might hit. While hurricanes rarely hit Corpus Christi, those that do leave behind tragedy including 1919's Florida Keys Hurricane and 2017's Hurricane Harvey.\n\nIann Dior\n\nFormer Corpus Christi resident Michael Ian Olmo, better known as Iann Dior, is a rap artist known for reaching No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 list in 2020 with his feature on 24kGoldn's \"Mood.\" He attended King High School and graduated from Veterans Memorial in 2017.\n\nIceRays\n\nThe minor league hockey team, named after stingrays who inhabit the Gulf of Mexico, has been part of Corpus Christi since 1998. Now part of the North American Hockey League, the hockey team draws local fans to the American Bank Center to cheer them on.\n\nThe Island\n\nYou want to go to the beach? You head to the Island.

It was also a popular concert location with acts like Alice Cooper, KISS, Ted Nugent, Heart, Black Sabbath, Rush, Santana, AC/DC and Selena performing there.\n\nOcean\n\nNeed to clear your mind or drive around to view the bay? Do what everyone does in Corpus Christi and go for a cruise down Ocean. Seven miles of scenic views along Ocean Drive includes sights of homes, condos, palm trees and bayside parks.\n\nPadre Staples Mall\n\nYou remember the jingle: \"Pa-pa-pa-padre Staples Mall! Woo-hoo! Shopping where you oughta be!\" Now La Palmera, the original second mall of Corpus Christi was home to former businesses including Beall's, Luby's Cafeteria, Orange Julius, Sanrio Surprise, Waldenbooks and the double decker Carousel Carnavale.\n\nSelena\n\nNext to Whataburger, Selena is the most Corpus Christi thing you think of when someone mentions our city. The Queen of Tejano moved to Corpus Christi in 1982 and has become an icon for her hometown. Her album \"Live!\" won Best Mexican/American Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards, becoming the first recording by a female Tejano artist to do so. A memorial statue of Selena, Mirador de la Flor, is located downtown in a gazebo along the Corpus Christi shoreline.\n\nSix Points\n\nNamed for the juncture made by three intersecting main streets, Alameda, Ayers and Staples, Six Points is Corpus Christi's earliest shopping district outside of the downtown area. Businesses around the area include Hester's Café & Coffee Bar, Luciano's Italian Restaurant, Bumblebee Antiques and 3rd Wish Tattoo Shop.\n\nSPID\n\nIt's known by its initials by a true Corpus Christi native and pronounced with each letter separate, SPID, or South Padre Island Drive, was built in 1941 as Lexington Boulevard and connected Ayers Street to the Naval Air Station in Flour Bluff. It connects all of the big streets in Corpus Christi including Ayers, Kostoryz, Weber, Everhart, Staples, Airline and Rodd Field.\n\nSunrise Mall\n\nNow known as the \"dead mall,\" Sunrise Mall used to be the go-to shopping mall back in the day. Businesses included Camelot Music, Corn Dog Seven, Five-Seven-Nine and Radio Shack, there was something for everyone to shop at. Sunrise Mall started to struggle when Padre Staples Mall started its rebranding and soon closed its doors for good in 2019. Pour one out for the Cinemark Dollar Cinema that everyone still misses.\n\nSurfing\n\nNext to fishing and and bird-watching, surfing has been a staple of Corpus Christi since the 1950s. You can catch surfers, or a wave, at Bob Hall Pier or J.P. Luby Surf Park. The city even held a national amateur surfing championship in 1987.\n\n'Surfing Jesus'\n\nLocated at the First United Methodist Church on North Shoreline Boulevard, you will find \"Surfing Jesus\" overlooking the Corpus Christi Bay. The statue's actual name is \"It is I.\" It is a representation of Jesus Christ standing at the front of a small boat, halting the storm on the Sea of Galilee from gospel accounts.\n\nUptown/downtown\n\nCorpus Christi's downtown is technically uptown, but uptown is in downtown. Confusing, isn't it? To better explain it, downtown is broken into six districts, according to the Downtown Management District. You've got Marina Arts, Sea District, Water's Edge, North Beach, Medical District and Uptown. Elevated, uptown is where you'll find City Hall, the County Courthouse, the Regional Transportation Authority and the Corpus Christi Independent School District office.\n\nThe Watergarden\n\nThe scenic Watergarden has been in Corpus Christi since 1988. Located next to the American Bank Center and the Art Museum of Corpus Christi, the fountain has been a staple of Corpus Christi for wedding proposals, photoshoots and a place to relax. Unfortunately, the Watergarden has been shut off for nearly five years, but city officials hope to have it up and running by the end of summer in 2022.\n\nRead related coverage:The Watergarden hasn't worked since Hurricane Harvey. Here's the $4.5M plan to fix it\n\nWhataburger\n\nHarmon Dobson was in his late 30s when he opened Whataburger in 1950 in Corpus Christi. The rest is history. You can buy the classic Whataburger, the Honey BBQ Chicken Strip Sandwich, Whatachick'n Strips, a Breakfast on a Bun, a warm cinnamon roll and the Dr. Pepper Shake. That's probably all we need for dinner tonight.\n\n'Your Corpus is showing'\n\nThis classic phrase is best used when someone from the Sparkling City by the Sea is showing some PG-13 related behavior that is questionable and/or embarrassing. While we might poke fun at ourselves here and there, you never want someone to tell you, \"Your Corpus is showing.\"\n\nMORE COVERAGE\n\nMore:Here are 10 reality celebrities who are native to the Corpus Christi area\n\nMore:Lights, camera, action: 10 movies that were filmed in Corpus Christi over past 40 years\n\nJohn Oliva covers education and community news in South Texas.

Flanagan\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPHILADELPHIA — I've got co-workers telling me about their grueling experiences at this past weekend's Marine Corps Marathon in Northern Virginia. The hills, the heat and the challenges sound excruciating. But I had a bigger personal challenge: The first Philadelphia Cheesesteak Festival on Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nFirst, you must understand the passion of Philadelphians when it comes to cheesesteaks. It's primal. There's the tasty rib-eye, the cheese, the onions. And let's not forget the Italian rolls. The whole is so much greater than the sum of its parts. It's just delectable. Don't bother arguing over where to get the best one, because everyone has a different take. Many of the heavy hitters — Pat’s, Geno’s, Steve’s Prince of Steaks, Tony Luke’s, Dalessandro’s — brought their exquisite, mouthwatering concoctions to the event.\n\nMany of us thought it was amazing that the city had never before put on a festival to celebrate the sacred sandwich. One organizer, David Feldman, told me that more than 20,000 people showed up to check out what 40 cheesesteak vendors had to offer. The festival sold out two days before game time. For $20 you could get into the place; $40 netted you a T-shirt and 10 cheesesteak samples; and for $60 you got a T-shirt, 20 samples and VIP seating. Vouchers were available for purchase throughout the fairgrounds.\n\nAmid the ice buckets of tall beer cans that were being hawked everywhere were carnival games, two mechanical bull rides and a zipline. I know ... how does devouring tons of cheesesteak and drinking beer mix with bull riding and ziplining? Well, we were going to find out.\n\nThe crowd was very diverse, reflecting the fact that the love of the greasy delicacy knows no racial or ethnic barriers. Everyone was ready to receive the beefy communion.\n\nUnfortunately, there was no one throwing food to the cheesesteak pilgrims as they waited in endlessly long lines as there was at the backed-up security queues during Pope Francis' visit to the city in September. We could have used them. The stomach growls were unmistakable at the stadium grounds, home of the city's beloved Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nFirst, let me break it down for the uninitiated. You can get your steak wit (with grilled onions) or witout. And you also get to specify which cheese you want. This issue can trigger serious emotions, so tread lightly. You can have a \"plain\" steak — no cheese — which is just plain stupid. Or you can have Cheez Whiz, provolone or American. And there's a serious ordering protocol: Provolone wit means you want your steak with provolone and onions.\n\nJust don't order a steak with ranch dressing or mayonnaise. Ever.\n\nBut yo ... here's the rub: The lines at the cheesesteak booths at the festival were overwhelming. Many salivating, disappointed attendees called the affair a complete waste of time and money.\n\n\"This was the freaking stand-in-line festival,\" said Joseph Simmons, 37, of Camden, N.J. \"I spent $80 on two people to come and get just two samples. And it took over two hours just for that! What a rip-off!\"\n\nSaid organizer Feldman: \"This thing blew up really quick.\"\n\nClose to the end of the festival, people were so frustrated that they were giving away their sample vouchers and heading for the exits.\n\nBut this true Philadelphian was determined to get the wit, the witout and the works (onions, mushrooms, peppers), because somewhere out there were at least 40 different cheesesteaks to try out. I was on a mission.\n\nI attended the festival with two 10-year-old girls who are on the \"see food\" diet. We started off the day by heading to the vegan cheesesteak booth. (No line there.) But given the huge crowds, I only had three more samples. Just four samples in four hours!\n\nDon't get me wrong: I thoroughly enjoyed all four samples. I got some great T-shirts, talked to some wonderful people, danced to good music and watched my two tween companions enjoy their first thrilling zipline. I was satisfied.\n\nBut I was hungry as hell at the end.\n\nFlanagan is a multiplatform editor at USA TODAY and an unapologetic Philadelphian.

The shutdown will leave about 1,000 regular workers temporarily unemployed for seven days. The problem is that Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama hasn’t been able to get enough parts because of a semiconductor shortage. As a result, production at the plant will be suspended until June 21. “No other downtime for this reason is expected,” said Robert Burns, vice president of human resources and administration. The company “will continue to work with Hyundai Motor Group’s global purchasing team to allocate microchips to its U.S. manufacturing plant to optimize production in the coming weeks and months,” Burns said. About 3,000 people work at the Montgomery plant. Most of them will continue to work this week. That includes maintenance workers, employees processing completed vehicles, and engine shop employees building engines to be delivered to Kia’s plant in Georgia. The plant produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans as well as the Santa Fe and Tucson SUVs. It began rolling out the new Santa Cruz pickup earlier this month after finishing a $410 million expansion. The company will help workers file unemployment claims, Burns said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Wildlife Troopers do not intend to issue a citation to a man recently seen lifting a baby moose over a guardrail in south-central Alaska, though it is illegal to “handle any wild animal in a similar fashion,” an Alaska State Troopers spokesperson said Thursday. Spokesperson Austin McDaniel said Alaska Wildlife Troopers “strongly advise people to stay a safe distance from all wildlife, including moose calves, as the animal may react aggressively towards humans.” Anyone who sees a wild animal that may need help should call the nearest law enforcement agency or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, McDaniel said in an email. Alaska’s News Source reports an Anchorage man, Joe Tate, was driving home Sunday from a fishing trip with friends when he saw a line of cars and a moose in the road on the Kenai Peninsula. Tate said a mother moose was pacing in the road, and a young calf struggled to scale a guardrail to join her. He estimated watching for about 30 minutes. He said he considered calling wildlife officials or law enforcement but worried an accident could occur in the time it would take for them to arrive. Friends with a trailer got between the mother and the calf, breaking the line of sight, Tate said. Another vehicle positioned itself similarly on the opposite side of traffic.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Worm Farm, focused on “turning garbage into food,” is growing produce sustainably in the desert. Worms eat food waste produced by the south Phoenix farm and elsewhere, including a brewery, diverting organic scraps from landfills. The invertebrates turn that into nutrient-rich compost that goes back into the ground and helps plants grow. The farm produces 40,000 to 50,000 worms a week and eliminates 1,000 pounds of waste from Phoenix landfills alone. The food it grows can feed its 10 employees with enough to donate to St. Mary’s Food Bank each week. All branches of the farm form a circle of life. “I’m trying to produce the garden of Eden,” Zach Brooks said. He was in the middle of his second master’s degree in sustainability at Arizona State University when he decided to start the farm, realizing he could put what he was learning into practice as easily as he could buy the materials online. “We didn’t invent anything that’s here on the farm,” he said. “Everything that’s necessary to live a zero-waste life is just a matter of doing it.” The site was the remnants of a cotton farm, its soil difficult for growing fruits and vegetables. “We couldn’t even get weeds to grow,” Brooks said. Nowadays, the soil is wet just beneath the surface, even after days without watering. “I dare you to go any place in Arizona and dig up a square of soil, and you won’t find that kind of life,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Abortion rights supporters asked a federal judge Monday to prevent the state’s near-total ban on the procedure from taking effect while the groups challenge its constitutionality. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the ban, set to take effect July 28. The groups filed a lawsuit last month challenging the ban, which prohibits abortions except those to save the life of the mother. The groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of Little Rock Family Planning Services, a Little Rock abortion clinic, and Planned Parenthood’s Little Rock health center. The groups are also representing a doctor who works at the Planned Parenthood clinic. “Absent an order from this Court, (the ban) will inflict on plaintiffs’ patients significant and irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,” Monday’s filing said. Amanda Priest, a spokeswoman for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, said the groups’ motion “should not come as a surprise to anyone.” “Attorney General Rutledge will be reviewing the latest action and will proceed,” she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A popular trail in Big Sur flanked by redwood trees that leads down through a gorge to a 60-foot waterfall is set to open to the public this week after a 13-year restoration needed when a wildfire destroyed access to it, officials announced Monday. After a $2 million renovation that fixed bridges, retaining walls, railings, steps and signage, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail will open Friday for the public to enjoy, said officials with the California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League, a San Francisco conservation group. To protect sensitive habitat, California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League officials replaced more than 4,150 square feet of asphalt and concrete and seven stream crossings, with the newly aligned trail and a 70-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spans the Pfeiffer Redwood Creek ravine and offers dramatic views, officials said. The Basin Complex Fire damaged the 0.75-mile trail, which connects with the Valley View trail to form a 1.5-mile loop that was the most popular hiking trail in Big Sur before the blaze. A subsequent fire, landslides, and a long closure of Highway 1 delayed the renovation and long-awaited reopening, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has rejected a request by the state’s Republican congressional delegation to stop paying jobless residents $300 extra a week in federal pandemic relief. The GOP representatives argue the payment, scheduled to run through Sept. 6, is hurting business by deterring unemployed workers from seeking jobs. U.S. Reps. Doug Lamborn, Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert noted in a Friday letter to Polis that Colorado restaurants and numerous other firms are struggling to hire workers. Many states led by Republican governors have ended the supplemental benefit. “We have to stop paying people that should be working to sit at home on the couch,” Boebert said in a statement. “It’s well past time for the government to end COVID bonuses and stop disincentivizing work.” Colorado Politics reports that Polis rejected the proposal, arguing in part that the benefit is helping business. “If Colorado ended these benefits prematurely, it would harm individuals, business owners, and the broader economy,” he wrote. Colorado is offering its own cash incentives for job-seekers. A “Jumpstart” program rewards those getting hired by month’s end with up to $1,600 in incentives. The state labor department reports some 3,800 new claims for regular state benefits were filed last week, the lowest level since the pandemic began.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools that still use Native American nicknames and mascots could take a financial hit if they continue to use those images without written consent from a state- or federally recognized tribe in their region, according to a provision tucked into a massive state budget implementation bill that’s up for a vote Monday. Municipalities face the prospect of losing their allotment of revenue from the Mashantucket Pequot/Mohegan Fund, an account that’s funded with the state’s 25% share of slot machine revenues generated at the two casinos owned and operated by the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribes. The provision was included in the budget bill by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee. “Towns around this state have been told year after year by Connecticut’s Native American tribes that their nicknames and mascots are horribly offensive,” Osten said in a statement. “If certain cities and towns won’t listen to their fellow citizens, then they can certainly do without the tribal money that they are showing such disrespect toward.” It’s estimated that about a dozen schools in Connecticut still use Native American names or images. Some communities have already changed the names of their athletic teams in recent years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Crab cake lovers have something to be, well, crabby about this summer: It might be harder and more expensive than ever to fill up on their favorite shellfish. A bevy of Delaware restaurants have begun limiting crab cake sales and even temporarily suspending “crab nights” because of a shortage of picked crab meat, as well as a sharp increase in prices to meet the growing demand. One reason for the shortage is that businesses are having a hard time finding employees to pick the sweet meat out of the crabs’ sharp shells. This year, just like last summer, restaurants and shops in beach resort towns did not get a stream of annual seasonal foreign workers because of travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic. According to Seafood News.com, crab meat prices have been rising and are at a high because of a lack of inventory, exacerbated by supply limitations in Asia due to COVID-19 and logistic constraints. And, locally, another problem, at least for now, could be there are fewer male crabs in the Chesapeake Bay. A survey from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Virginia Institute of Marine Science estimates the total abundance of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay in 2021 was 282 million crabs, a below-average total for the 32 years of survey results.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The owners of a bar said Monday that they are investigating a weekend incident in which security guards were seen dragging a Black woman down a staircase and throwing her out of the establishment. Nellie’s Sports Bar’s owners also said on Facebook that they have “terminated, with immediate effect, the independent security vendor hired to protect our guests during Pride Week.” Video posted on social media early Sunday shows a bouncer dragging the woman – identified by local media as Keisha Young, 22 – down the stairs as observers scream, “Oh my God!” Some patrons are then seen fighting with the guards. On a video call Monday with her lawyer, Young said: “I feel like, even just separating race from it, no man should ever handle a woman in that way. That should never be OK,” according to Washington’s WRC-TV. A crowd gathered outside Nellie’s Sunday night to protest Young’s treatment. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday: “Obviously, entrepreneurs enforce rules in their restaurants. But they’re not allowed to assault anybody.” Nellie’s owners said the bar “will be closed this week as we evaluate this regrettable situation,” and they vowed to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis visited a South Florida Jewish temple to denounce anti-Semitism and stand with Israel on Monday as the Republican governor cloaked himself in religion while signing a bill into law that would require public schools in his state to set aside at least one minute of silence for children to meditate or pray. His visit to the Shul of Bal Harbour, a Jewish community center in Surfside, had the air of a campaign event. DeSantis seemed to blush when the Rabbi Sholom Lipskar introduced him as a “great governor and future world leader.” It has been speculated that the governor, who is running for reelection next year, might run for president in 2024. DeSantis visited the temple to sign two bills into law. One would expand the role of volunteer ambulance services, while the other makes Florida one of at least 15 states, according to a legislative analysis, that would compel public schools to hold moments of silence. The state had already been among roughly 18 other states that gave schools the option to do so. “The idea that you can just push God out of every institution and be successful – I’m sorry, our Founding Fathers did not believe that,” DeSantis said. The ambulance bill allows some volunteer first responders, including those run by faith-based groups, to use emergency lights and sirens when responding to emergencies. Some Orthodox Jews rely on these volunteer ambulance services to help overcome religious sensitivities that prevent some people form using traditional emergency services.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is establishing a therapeutic foster care program to provide specialized treatment for children with an assortment of behavioral, mental and developmental challenges. Georgia is providing $6.7 million to begin the program that Tom Rawlings, director of the Division of Family and Children Services, called a pilot initiative that he hopes will expand in the future. A similar program existed over a decade ago, and Rawlings and other advocates see its return as a major step toward strengthening welfare services for children with intense treatment needs. “There is this, I believe, very special population of children with very severe emotional issues, often co-occurring autism spectrum and mental health issues, and we as a state really have to develop a more specialized system,” Rawlings said. “And I think that this is a major step toward that.” Therapeutic foster care differs from traditional foster care in several ways. Children placed in a therapeutic care home have individualized care needs that often arise from past trauma. Foster parents in a therapeutic program are trained to handle these challenges and provide around-the-clock care. Children in this program also receive crucial treatment services, usually involving therapy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. is giving Native Hawaiians surplus land as compensation for acres that were meant for homesteading but used instead by the federal government. The land transfer also attempts to help right wrongs against the Indigenous people of Hawaii, officials said Monday. The 80 acres in Ewa Beach formerly used for the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center will eventually provide up to 400 homes while helping fulfill terms of a settlement authorized by Congress in 1995 to compensate Native Hawaiians for 1,500 acres that were set aside for homelands but subsequently acquired and used by the federal government for other purposes, officials said. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s voice choked with emotion while making the announcement Monday. “Yes, it’s a happy day, but it’s also a sad day because we remember the tragedy that befell the Native Hawaiians throughout their tumultuous history,” said Haaland, the first Native American woman to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency. “Since that time, our country has learned a great deal. And now we are in an era where we recognize the importance of healing the generational traumas that caused pain and heartache.” The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by allowing them to use land to live on, with a 99-year lease for $1 a year.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four housing organizations in the state are getting coronavirus relief funding to help cover the cost of emergency housing vouchers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $2.4 million total to the Housing Authority of the City of Pocatello, the Boise City Housing Authority, the Southwestern Idaho Cooperative Housing Authority, and the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, the Idaho Press reports. The money will cover 217 vouchers and related administrative costs, according to a prepared statement from HUD, and is part of $1 billion being awarded to housing organizations nationwide. As of January 2020, Idaho had about 2,300 people “experiencing homelessness on any given day,” according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Addressing our nation’s homelessness crisis is a top priority for HUD,” HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. Deanna Watson, the executive director of the Boise City/Ada County Housing Authority, said increases in rent levels have a lot of people getting priced out of the market. The vouchers will work by subsidizing rents in a place with fair market rents, Watson said. In addition, there’s assistance in some of the fees that come with finding houses, security deposits and case management.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A cave system closed more than a decade ago is reopening to the public. The state Department of Natural Resources announced last week that Illinois Caverns in Monroe County would reopen Wednesday. Officials closed the southern Illinois cave in 2010 as a precaution for bats who live there due to the spread of a fatal disease called white-nose syndrome. WNS is named after the white fungus found on the muzzle, ears and wings of infected bats. White-nose syndrome cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, but officials feared humans exploring caves could spread it from one location to another, endangering more bats. Joe Kath, the department’s Endangered Species Program manager, said the disease’s prevalence in bats hibernating within Illinois Caverns has been relatively low since the closure compared to other locations in the state. “The caverns – one of the state’s scenic wonders – attracted visitors from across the state, which is why the decision was made to close them,” Kath said. “Our biologists felt that proactively closing Illinois Caverns, and other state-managed caves across the state, was the best option to protect the state’s bat population from (white-nose syndrome).” Illinois Caverns will be open Wednesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and seasonally from April through October.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two legal organizations are suing the state to prevent Gov. Eric Holcomb from pulling out of a federal unemployment program that’s paying benefits to hundreds of thousands of residents. Macey Swanson Hicks & Sauer law firm and Indiana Legal Services, an organization that provides legal assistance to low-income Hoosiers, filed a joint civil lawsuit in Marion County Superior Court, claiming the end of the benefits would hurt their clients and people across the state. The organizations argued that Indiana law requires the state to procure federal insurance benefits to its citizens. “These benefits have provided life-sustaining and crucial assistance to many Hoosiers during the pandemic,” Jon Laramore, executive director of Indiana Legal Services, said in a statement. “The legislature passed a law creating a right to these benefits, and we’re asking Governor Holcomb to follow the law.” The Republican governor announced last month he was ending the federal benefits June 19 because many businesses in the service industry are struggling to fill jobs. While economists are skeptical that unemployment benefits are the reason people aren’t returning to low-wage jobs, Holcomb is banking on the benefits cut to drive more people back to work.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials at the city’s public water system on Monday asked customers to begin using water wisely and cut lawn irrigation by 25% as water usage reached new highs and drought conditions slowed the flow of rivers. The combination of high demand and low water flow resulted in Des Moines Water Works demand reaching 90% of capacity Friday. The utility that serves 500,000 customers in central Iowa said it delivered nearly 90 million gallons of water that day. “We have taken proactive steps to ensure we have enough water for customers, but the Raccoon River is low enough that you can walk across it. Now, we are asking our customers to do their part and use water wisely,” CEO Ted Corrigan said. The flow rate in the Raccoon River, which is a major water source for the DMWW, is down to less than 300 cubic feet per second compared the median flow of 4,000 cubic feet per second. The average high temperature for Des Moines for the first 13 days of June was 88, significantly above the normal of 79.9, according to the National Weather Service. The city has had 0.02 inches of rain this month. The average is 5.26 inches. In Iowa, 46% of the state is classified as in moderate drought, up from 29% the week before, said the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is going to struggle to vaccinate more residents, a top aide to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said, and thousands of families will lose extra food aid because top Republican legislators on Tuesday ended a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic. Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff, said the state will no longer be able to use its National Guard to distribute vaccines or personal protective equipment, and addressing COVID-19 is “just going to be more difficult.” Senate President Ty Masterson announced the cancellation of a meeting of eight leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature set for Tuesday afternoon. A law enacted in late March required the legislative leaders to sign off on an extension, and Masterson’s announcement meant the state of emergency was to expire at the end of Tuesday after being in place since March 2020. Kelly accused Republicans of “political obstruction.” She told reporters last week that she wanted the state of emergency to continue at least through August. “A state disaster response has never been, and should not be, political,” Kelly said in a statement. But “it is time for Kansas to return to normal,” Masterson, R-Andover, said in a joint statement with two other GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Larry Alley, of Winfield, and Vice President Rick Wilborn, of McPherson.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State residents now have the option of getting their driver’s license renewed online. The service launched Monday, with Kentucky Transportation Secretary Jim Gray saying it would lead to “greater efficiency, greater security and more choices” for drivers. Online renewal is available for those with standard-issue or Real ID licenses that will expire within six months or have been expired for less than a year, officials said. Renewals must also maintain the same card version as well as the same name and address as their current license. Applications for a replacement license or a license with a name or address change must still be made in person. Online renewal is among the options available due to the phased transfer of licensing services to the Transportation Cabinet’s regional offices from local offices of the circuit court clerks, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: People caught with small amounts of recreational marijuana will soon face a misdemeanor fine and no possibility of jail time, under a bill that Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday he has signed into law. The measure sponsored by state Rep. Cedric Glover, D-Shreveport, won narrow, bipartisan support in the legislative session that ended Thursday. With the Democratic governor’s signature, the new law will take effect Aug. 1. Glover’s bill makes possession of up to 14 grams of marijuana – a half-ounce – a misdemeanor crime carrying a fine up to $100 with no possibility of jail time, even for repeat offenses. “This is not a decision I took lightly,” Edwards said in his statement announcing the bill signing. He described the legislation as another step in Louisiana’s “criminal justice reform efforts.” “In addition to carefully reviewing the bill, I also believe deeply that the state of Louisiana should no longer incarcerate people for minor legal infractions, especially those that are legal in many states, that can ruin lives and destroy families, as well as cost taxpayers greatly,” Edwards said. Several municipalities around Louisiana already had switched to fines rather than arrests for possession of small amounts of recreational cannabis, and the state has a legal medical marijuana program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state House voted Monday to eliminate Maine’s secretive “fusion center” created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure data is shared among law enforcement agencies. The 88-54 vote followed a whistleblower lawsuit and legislative scrutiny of the center, which was accused of gathering and storing intelligence on gun buyers, power line protesters, and employees of a camp for Israeli and Arab teens. Further votes would be necessary to close the center, which is an arm of the Maine State Police. The proposal provoked fierce debate – and rare bipartisan support – with lawmakers invoking George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and even making comparisons to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. Another lawmaker countered by suggesting the bill was a veiled attempt to defund the police. Rep. Jeffrey Evangelos, an independent from Friendship, said the goal of sharing information about foreign-based terrorism was admirable but said there was “mission creep” beyond the center’s original purpose. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlotte Warren, D-Hallowell, said the operator of the fusion center couldn’t demonstrate that it was an effective use of taxpayer dollars or that it offered something new that other law enforcement agencies didn’t already provide.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency will end July1, more than 15 months after the deadly coronavirus made its first appearance in the state in March 2020. All remaining health restrictions will end on that date, Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday, including mask mandates. “The battle’s not over,” Hogan said. “We’re transitioning from a state of emergency to an ongoing operation.” That operation will include continuing to vaccinate thousands of Marylanders who still need COVID-19 shots and caring for the shrinking number of people sickened by the virus. Over the course of the pandemic, Maryland has seen more than 460,000 cases of COVID-19. Nearly 9,500 people have died, many of them elderly and vulnerable. Hogan said Tuesday that Maryland’s health metrics have improved significantly since the worst peak of the pandemic in the winter. “We have finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel,” Hogan said. There will be a 45-day grace period after July 1 to allow Marylanders to adjust to the end of emergency regulations, Hogan said. That includes an extra 45 days to renew driver’s licenses and an extension to the state’s eviction moratorium. Ending the state of emergency does not affect Maryland’s access to federal funds, Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is giving away five $1 million cash prizes and five $300,000 college scholarships to residents who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. The aim of the so-called VaxMillions Giveaway, modeled after a similar program in Ohio, is to drive up the state’s vaccination rate, already one of the best in the nation, he said. About 4 million Bay Staters are already fully vaccinated, according to the Department of Public Health. “So if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines and thinking about getting vaccinated but for whatever reason haven’t, here’s another reason for you to come forward, protect yourself, your friends, your co-workers and your neighbors by getting vaccinated here in the commonweath,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. All legal residents who have been vaccinated in the state are eligible to register for the lottery prizes by going to mass.gov/VaxMillions starting July 1. Residents ages 18 and older are eligible for the $1 million prizes, while residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for the scholarships, which are in the form of grants via a 529 College Savings Plan managed by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. The state will hold weekly drawings for five weeks starting July 26.\n\nMichigan\n\nAllendale Township: Community leaders in western Michigan have voted to keep a statue of Confederate and Union Civil War soldiers with a Black child kneeling between them. The Allendale Township board voted 5-2 on Monday, despite a recommendation from a group that the statue be replaced by one with Union soldiers who are Black, Native American and white. “It’s been made very clear to me that the majority of our residents wish for the Civil War statue to remain in the garden of honor,” said Jody Hansen, township clerk and board member. Dozens of people attended the meeting, which was held outdoors at a park bandshell, 15 miles west of Grand Rapids. “What better lesson can we teach our children than by being able to say, ‘We had this thing. We thought it was OK. We have since learned that we were wrong,’ ” said area resident Cathy Seaver, who wants the statue removed. Trustee Barb VanderVeen, who opposed keeping the statue, asked if the child, which represents a slave, could at least be removed. Trustee Candy Kraker said the artist indicated that removing it would damage the structural integrity.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A group representing landlords announced a lawsuit Tuesday to force an end to the eviction moratorium imposed by Gov. Tim Walz, saying his order makes it all but impossible for property owners to remove disruptive tenants. The Minnesota Multi Housing Association said the governor’s executive order, which was issued in the early days of the pandemic, has become unworkable as it was originally written and is no longer needed. “Over the past year it has become clear that property owners are expected to wait until there is evidence that a person has become so dangerous that other residents have to call the police or move out, or that the rental unit is completely destroyed,” according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court Monday. The association’s CEO, Cecil Smith, told reporters at the Capitol that the lawsuit had been in the works long before legislative leaders agreed Monday to a 15-week “off-ramp” for ending the moratorium. The negotiators said the bipartisan agreement offers strong protections for renters and clear timelines for Minnesotans who owe back rent to secure rental assistance, which is paid directly to landlords. Landlords would be required to send notices to tenants who are behind on their rent 15 days prior to eviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nWater Valley: A former state lawmaker was found shot to death over the weekend in a rural area outside the burned home where her sister-in-law was found dead after Christmas. Ashley Henley, 40, was a Republican who served in the state House from January 2016 to January 2020 from a district in DeSoto County. The North Mississippi Herald was first to report that Henley’s body was found Sunday night in rural Yalobusha County, about 70 miles south of DeSoto County. Her body was outside the home where the body of her sister-in-law Kristina Michelle Jones was found Dec. 26. The Herald published a photo of a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase, “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that the time of Henley’s death had not yet been determined. Stark told WMC-TV that Henley had been mowing grass at the home before she was killed. Henley was a teacher before she was elected to the state House, and she often took her young son to the state Capitol during legislative sessions. She sought a second term in November 2019 and lost by 14 votes to a Democrat. Henley challenged the outcome, saying she believed she had found voting irregularities. A committee in the GOP-controlled House held a hearing and denied Henley’s petition.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson enacted a new law Tuesday limiting the duration of local public health restrictions and barring governments from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public facilities and transportation. The law took effect immediately upon Parson’s signature, but it may have little immediate effect because most local officials already lifted their coronavirus restrictions on businesses and public gatherings and have not been checking people’s vaccination status. Parson, a Republican, said the law still is important for the future. “Then next time we do get in a crisis, we’re going to have a little bit more safeguards for the general public to make sure they have more transparency and more of a voice in the process,” he said. When under a statewide emergency declaration, the new law limits local orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by a majority vote of the local governing body such as a city council. If there is no state emergency declaration, then local orders closing entire classifications of entities or activities could last for only 21 days, unless extended by a two-thirds vote of the local governing body.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Public review has begun for a proposal to boost radio and cellphone service in Glacier National Park, park officials said. The deadline to comment is July 11. The proposal calls for upgrades to communications from the National Park Service, which uses outdated technology or can’t reach remote areas of the park, the Missoulian reports. Currently, cellphone service is only available in the western part of the park at Apgar and the eastern part of the park because of commercial cell towers outside the park borders. “While recognizing that national parks provide disconnected space for many visitors, the plan also proposes a strategy for commercial cellular and/or internet access for public and NPS use in certain developed areas,” such as Many Glacier, Rising Sun, Two Medicine and Lake McDonald Lodge, park spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The proposal would prohibit large-scale cell towers and commercial telecommunications gear in the backcountry, despite visitors and employees alike relying more on internet access. Signal strength would be limited as much as possible to the four developed areas mentioned in the proposal, Kerzman said, although some spillover might be unpreventable.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state is approaching having 70% of its adult population vaccinated against COVID-19, but the pace of distribution of the shots continues to slow. The state may be close to President Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% or more of all adults with at least one dose of the vaccine by July 4. About 63% of Nebraskans 18 and older had received at least one shot as of Friday, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate ranks 24th among all the states. Nebraska has 57% of its adults fully vaccinated. Vermont leads the nation with 84% of its adults having received at least one shot, and 14 states have exceeded Biden’s goal. The CDC said roughly 31,000 shots were distributed in Nebraska last week, which was down from 37,000 the week before and well below the mid-April peak of 150,000 in a week. The number of new virus cases reported in the state continues to fall. Nebraska reported 234 new cases last week, down from 254 the week before and 378 two weeks ago. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 44.86 new cases per day May 30 to 28.43 new cases per day Sunday. Nebraska has reported 223,888 virus cases and 2,258 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Advocates are building momentum toward setting aside a wide desert area rich with biological diversity and Native American cultural significance for permanent environmental protection. The southern Nevada site would be called Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and encompass a Spanish Colonial Revival house that once belonged to 1920s-era Hollywood actors Clara Bow and Rex Bell on their historic Walking Box Ranch. The rugged and dry landscape is dotted with Joshua trees between mountain ranges west of Searchlight. At more than 594 square miles, it covers an area larger than San Francisco Bay. “There are threats to the sort of peace and the environment that we’re in right now,” Gabriel di Chiara, a Nevada Conservation League organizer, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “And we believe establishing this monument will preserve this land and this way of life for future generations, and it’s vitally important.” Conservation advocates providing a tour of the 5,000-square-foot homesite June 9 said they saw hope in President Joe Biden’s administration, a federal conservation plan that aims to protect 30% of American lands and water by 2030, and the appointment of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland as the first Native American head of a presidential Cabinet post.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As the number of COVID-19 cases has fallen and restrictions have been dropped in the state, drug overdoses are on the rise in some cities. Suspected overdoses in Manchester and Nashua rose by 26% in May, according to American Medical Response. The 72 suspected overdoses was the most in a single month since June 2019, WMUR-TV reports. Overdoses decreased during the pandemic since more people were inside, said AMR Regional Director Chris Stawasz. “It gives us concern that in the summer months, which we typically see as higher overdose months, we’re going to be back probably at levels we have not seen in several years,” he said. More people now have access to the overdose reversal drug Narcan, officials said. There was record use of Narcan in May in Manchester.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Fifteen months after they were shuttered at the height of the pandemic, adult day care centers will be allowed to reopen due to a sharp decline in COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and cases, state officials said Monday. The centers, which provide activities for those suffering from dementia, were closed to protect the elderly March 20, 2020, when there were only 890 cases and 11 confirmed COVID deaths in the state. Since then, New Jersey has tallied more than 890,000 cases and 26,000 COVID-19 deaths, the vast majority of which have been among seniors. The adult centers are some of the few facilities that are still closed due to COVID-19, while most other venues have been reopened for more than a year, and mask-wearing and social distancing have been relaxed. Safety guidance on how to return to operations such as requiring screenings for staff was to be sent out to the centers Monday, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Among the procedures: Staff must wear masks regardless of vaccination status. Participants can engage in close group activities if everyone is vaccinated. An isolation room is needed for a sick participant. And windows and doors should remain open to promote better ventilation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is urging cities and counties to consider banning the sale of fireworks ahead of the July Fourth holiday. She issued an executive order Monday, pointing to the drought that has blanketed much of the state and the fire restrictions that already are in place across New Mexico’s five national forests. While state statutes prevent the governor from imposing a statewide ban, the governor’s office is encouraging municipalities to take action to limit fire danger by adopting fireworks restrictions over the coming weeks. Rio Rancho and Farmington have warned residents that only permissible fireworks will be allowed – such as cone fountains, crackling devices and sparklers – and only in paved or otherwise barren areas. Dona Ana County recently approved restrictions that will span the holiday. “We want to prevent fires in the dangerous conditions we are experiencing,” County Fire Chief Shannon Cherry said, referring to the dry and windy weather. Farmington’s proclamation also will remain in effect for 30 days, but officials said the City Council may extend it if extreme conditions continue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dozens of Holocaust survivors clapped, sang and danced Monday at a concert held in their honor in Brooklyn in the first large gathering for New York-area survivors after months of isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. The concert by popular Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey was organized by the Nachas Health and Family Network and other groups that help the more than 35,000 Holocaust survivors estimated to live in the New York City metropolitan area. “It’s extremely good for the soul, for the heart, to see people coming out once again and socializing,” said Dolly Rabinowitz, who sat in the front row of the Yeshivah of Flatbush auditorium joined by other Holocaust survivors and students of the Modern Orthodox Jewish school. The survivors, most now in their 80s and 90s, suffered unspeakable horrors in concentration camps. In the past year, many remained isolated at home because they were at a high risk from the fast-spreading virus. “To be out once again is like reviving ourselves. To sit among our children and grandchildren is heartwarming,” said Rabinowitz, who lived through Auschwitz and the Death March. Some held hands and choked back tears when they heard an instrumental version of “Ani Ma’amin,” sung by many Jews herded into cattle cars on their way to concentration camps.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Constitution Party of North Carolina and North Carolina Green Party have failed to garner enough signatures to remain official political parties in the state for now, an election official said Monday. The State Board of Elections determined earlier this year that the two small parties had fallen short of candidate support thresholds from last November. But the board said the parties would be recognized again to field candidates starting later this year if each collected about 13,900 signatures of registered voters by Saturday. Neither party reached that goal, board spokesman Noah Grant wrote in an email. That means their parties’ registrants – totaling 9,600 between them – will now be re-designated as unaffiliated voters. The confirmed signatures so far – over 2,800 for the Constitution Party and fewer than 10 for the Green Party – will roll over into petitions to field candidates in the November 2022 election, Grant said. The groups would need to be meet the thresholds by next June 1 to qualify. For now, the state will recognize just three official political parties: Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2021 fell nearly 10% over the same period the previous year. Taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.1 billion, a 9.9% decrease over the three-month span in 2020. Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger said the drop was due to the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the state’s economy. Despite the decline statewide, Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot all reported increases, led by Fargo at 17.6%. Ten of the 15 major industry sectors reported declines over the year. The mining and oil extraction sector decreased by $438 million, or about 59%. The wholesale trade sector decreased by $250 million, a 23.5% drop. North Dakota’s taxable sales and purchases are a key indicator of economic activity in the state. They also are used to forecast state budgets.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans receiving food stamps would have to undergo a new “asset test” that measures total worth, including the value of cars owned by anyone in a household, under a provision in the Senate’s version of the state’s upcoming two-year budget. The goal of the test is to be sure needy recipients of SNAP benefits get what they deserve, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. “There are a lot of folks who can afford to pay for a variety of things who are still receiving these benefits,” Huffman said this month. The measure incorporates elements of stand-alone legislation introduced earlier this year in the GOP-controlled Senate. Dozens of people representing food banks, legal aid groups and health care advocacy groups have testified against it. Opponents of that bill, pending in the Senate Government Oversight and Reform Committee, say it comes at the worst possible time, as emergency federal benefits enacted during the coronavirus pandemic expire. Those include maximum allotments for food stamp recipients, a $300 weekly unemployment supplement, and a moratorium on evictions. “It will force low-income Ohioans to choose between having food and owning a car to get to work or saving money to prepare for an emergency,” said Kelsey Bergfeld, director of Columbus-based Advocates for Ohio’s Future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: “Tiger King” Joe Exotic is selling items seen on the hit Netflix series that elevated the big cat handler into a household name. The auction will also include NFT versions – digital “non-fungible tokens” – of those items and artwork. Exotic, real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, will be selling 3D renderings of cult collectibles sold alongside real-life tangible items seen on the show, as well as digital artworks for fans. Items include Exotic’s Smith & Wesson revolver, a fringed leather jacket and images autographed from prison. Online auction house Mintable will present the auction Friday at officialtigerkingnft.com. Also up for bid are the Tiger King’s black leather jacket and pants set, a bikini worn by adult film actress Rachel Starr, digital trading cards and artwork, and audio recordings of Exotic made from federal prison, where he’s serving a 22-year sentence for hiring someone to murder nemesis Carol Baskin. He was already somewhat of a celebrity in Oklahoma before Netflix launched the “Tiger King” series last year. For years, he ran an exotic animal park near Wynnewood, offering guests an up-close experience with big cats like his namesake tigers. He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party’s nomination for governor in 2018, two years after campaigning for president.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 4 in 10 Oregonians strongly or somewhat agree with statements that reflect core arguments of white nationalist and other far-right groups, according to a new statewide survey. DHM Research and the Oregon Values and Beliefs Center, both independent nonpartisan organizations, surveyed 603 Oregon residents in a 15-minute online questionnaire Jan. 8-13. They estimate the margin of error is between 2.4% and 4.0%. To recruit respondents, DHM used a professionally maintained panel. It also set demographic quotas and weighted data to ensure a representative sample. Survey results indicated that, compared to a DHM Research panel in 2018, fewer Oregonians believed in protecting and preserving the country’s multicultural heritage. More agreed America “must protect and preserve its white European heritage.” It’s a “disturbing” revelation, said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at Western States Center, the progressive nonprofit organization that commissioned the research. She said the 4 in 10 represent a growing population in the state that is vulnerable to messages commonly used by white nationalists like the ones posed in the survey, including the “white heritage” idea and that “white people in America face discrimination and unfair treatment on the basis of their race.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A ban on employers mandating vaccines for their workers inched ahead in the state House on Tuesday with a committee vote supported by all Republicans and opposed by every Democrat. The main sponsor, Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, called it “a very simple question of workers’ rights.” Diamond has been a fervent opponent of coronavirus mitigation policies and has been publicly skeptical of mask-wearing and vaccines. Labor and Industry Committee Chairman Jim Cox, R-Berks, said lawmakers were responding to increasing reports that employers are requiring COVID-19 vaccines, forcing some workers to choose between the jab or losing a job. An amendment by Cox took out a provision in Diamond’s bill that would have ended employer-mandated tests for marijuana. Diamond said after the meeting that the marijuana testing language lacked support. The bill would let workers or prospective workers avoid workplace-mandated vaccinations by putting into writing that their doctor has concerns it might harm their health; that they have religious or “strong moral or ethical” convictions against a vaccine; that they already contracted COVID-19; or that they are concerned because tge vaccines have not been fully approved by federal regulators.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State officials are proposing to build a new laboratory to replace the one run by the Health Department, which is the only Level 3 biosafety facility in the state. Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott is advocating for spending $82 million to replace the State Health Lab that she said had limited capacity to expand testing needed during the coronavirus pandemic because the building’s systems are outdated. “When it came to testing, for example, where we were leaders, we ultimately were inhibited by our ability to expand just because of the confines of the building and the electrical supply for the building,” Alexander-Scott said. “With the next pandemic, we are going to need the ability to expand and shift and streamline.” The medical examiner’s office, state crime lab and environmental testing labs are also located in the same building as the State Health Lab in downtown Providence across from the state Capitol. Gov. Dan McKee included the allocation for the new lab in the proposed budget. If the Legislature approves the spending, it would come from the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief that the state is getting. The new fiscal year starts July 1, and a final budget bill is expected this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: It may just be loose change, but parking meters are helping to show how tourism is booming along the state’s most popular beach after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted. Myrtle Beach collected as much in parking fees in May as it does in a typical June, Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Office Executive Director Brian Schmitt told The Post and Courier of Charleston. “2021 has just been nuts,” Schmitt said. “In March, we did April numbers. In April, we did May numbers. … If that trend continues, then we hit June with July numbers – which July is typically our best month, our $360,000 month – we expect to maybe see that continue.” The city no longer just collects coins from meters. There are parking lot terminals that take debit and credit cards and a mobile app called ParkMobile that allows drivers to stop their cars and pay with a click of a smartphone, officials said. More traditional ways of measuring tourism are also up in Myrtle Beach. The Chamber of Commerce said hotel occupancy rates are up this summer compared to 2019. The officials don’t use 2020 numbers to compare because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge on Monday criminally charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court and obstructing justice after a dispute with a marshal who refused to disclose her COVID-19 vaccination status and removed prisoners from a courthouse. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow May 10, after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19, the Aberdeen American News reports. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann gave the U.S. Attorney’s Office until Friday to decide whether to charge the marshals, including Daniel Mosteller, the head of the agency in South Dakota, and Stephen Houghtaling, the state’s chief deputy. Kornmann said he was determined to find another prosecutor if the U.S. attorney declined to prosecute the case. Kornmann moved in March to require vaccinations for courthouse employees, but Mosteller told the judge the Marshals Service was not requiring employees to get vaccinated and would not provide their vaccination status to the court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal courts released 18% of Tennessee prisoners who requested compassionate release in 2020, a new report from the federal Sentencing Commission shows. At the height of COVID-19 last year, thousands of motions asking for reduced sentences were filed in courts across the nation, according to the commission. Most of those were filed by the defendants themselves. Combined, 336 federal defendants in Tennessee districts filed motions for compassionate release. The courts released 61 of them. The Sentencing Commission tracks federal sentencing trends and policy, regularly releasing reports on that data. The June 10 report focuses only on compassionate release cases. Nationally, a total of 2,549 defendants were compassionately released, their sentences ending, according to the commission. That number is 21% of those who tried. “Compassionate release” is a broad term, usually related to sentencing laws that allow the court to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to warrant an early release. At least 6,654 people in Tennessee Department of Corrections custody had contracted COVID-19 as of last week, and 42 of them are believed to have died from the disease.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: On the cusp of summer, the electric power grid manager for most of the state on Monday issued its second conservation alert since the deadly February blackout, calling on users to dial back energy consumption through Friday to avert an emergency. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said many forced generation outages and record June demand have squeezed the power supply. It appealed to users to set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees and avoid using large electric appliances until demand decreased late in the day. ERCOT predicted a peak demand load on its system of 73,000 megawatts, far above the June record of 69,123 megawatts set between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. June 27, 2018. However, as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, 12,178 megawatts of the grid’s 86,862 megawatts of generating capacity were offline, ERCOT said, leaving a razor-thin margin of reserve capacity of about 2,000 megawatts. “We will be conducting a thorough analysis with generation owners to determine why so many units are out of service,” Woody Rickerson, ERCOT vice president of grid planning and operations, said in a statement. “This is unusual for this early in the summer season.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Transportation officials have reported nearly twice as many people died in alcohol-involved crashes on the state’s roads last year compared to the year before, despite less commuter traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Transportation said there were 61 fatal crashes involving alcohol last year compared to the 32 crashes in 2019, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Department officials said there was also an 11% increase in traffic fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2020, which includes fatal alcohol-involved crashes. Nationally, there was a 7% increase in traffic fatalities over the past year and a 9% increase in alcohol-involved fatalities, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Robert Miles, director of traffic and safety for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it’s too soon to know why fatal crashes increased. He said the pattern has surprised everyone, including traffic experts. “I think … most people thought if there is less traffic on the street there will be fewer fatalities; there will be fewer crashes,” he said. “We saw fewer crashes, but we saw more fatal crashes.” Miles said it is possible people began taking more risks while driving because of extra road space created by reduced traffic. But he also said not every type of fatal crash increased in the past year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Now that the state of emergency imposed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in Vermont is ending, meetings of public bodies must be held in person, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said. During the pandemic, public boards were authorized to hold those meetings remotely. Condos said boards can still allow people to attend remotely, but a physical meeting location must be provided, and those bodies must physically post notices of the meetings. “Vermont’s public servants have made it clear that our government can still operate and make critical decisions during a public health emergency without sacrificing the right of Vermonters to know how their government is making those decisions and their right to participate in the process,” Condos said in a statement Monday. “As we transition towards our shared ‘new normal,’ it is vital that we use the many successes, best practices, and lessons learned from the last 15 months to improve how we, as trusted public officials, best serve the public.” On Monday, after the state vaccinated just over 80% of the eligible population, Gov. Phil Scott lifted all COVID-19 restrictions. The state of emergency that allowed the remote meetings expired at midnight Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A dental student at Virginia Commonwealth University has been awarded $10,000 by her school to develop a prototype for her invention to help those wearing braces floss between their teeth. Student Christina Gordon first developed her idea for the Proxy-Flosser when she was 10 years old and looking for a better way to complete the tedious task. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports she put something together akin to a floss pick and didn’t think much else about it until she enrolled in dental school. She said she was shocked to learn that a better product still hadn’t been invented, and she began making inquiries about whether her Proxy-Flosser was marketable. She won $10,000 from VCU’s Innovation Gateway, which helps faculty and students commercialize their innovations. Because her idea has not been patented, she is not publicly disclosing the details of her invention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a law that will require meal-delivery apps to sign agreements with restaurants instead of listing restaurants on the apps and taking orders without permission. Council President M. Lorena Gonzalez, who sponsored the law, said it will protect restaurants, simplify work for delivery-app drivers and give customers more reliable service, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-0 on Monday. Mayor Jenny Durkan hadn’t reviewed the law yet to determine whether she’ll sign it or let it become law without her signature, her office said. Council staff noted the law could result in some restaurants paying delivery fees they’re not paying now, possibly less work for drivers and fewer options for customers. Gonzalez said restaurant industry groups such as Seattle Restaurant Alliance backed the measure, and labor groups and delivery apps were consulted. Delivery apps Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats didn’t immediately comment. Brianna Megid, a spokesperson for DoorDash, said restaurants should have the power to make choices affecting their businesses. DoorDash removes restaurants, when requested, she said. Under the status quo, delivery apps can use online menus and other information to list restaurants without permission. Restaurants may not even know they’re listed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hundreds of demonstrators outraged with Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to a sweeping overhaul of U.S. election law marched through the capital city Monday evening. The Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, denounced the influential moderate Democratic senator and called for a diverse coalition of working people to apply pressure on Manchin, who recently opposed a $15 minimum wage and the price tag of President Joe Biden’s initial $2 trillion infrastructure plan. “West Virginia needs a real senator,” Barber told the crowd at a Charleston park. Then they marched a mile to Manchin’s office. Unable to meet with the senator – an aide told Barber he was in Washington – leaders of the demonstration affixed a poster-sized protest letter to the front doors of the office building. Rallygoers took turns signing their names on it. When Manchin’s aides offered comment cards to collect protestors’ grievances, Barber waved them away: “We don’t want to talk to the staff.” The protest was spurred by Manchin’s decision to oppose a landmark reform of U.S. election law, a proposal known as For the People Act. Manchin said last week that passing reform on a party-line vote risked further stoking partisan divides.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The superintendents of the state’s five largest school districts told members of the Legislature on Tuesday that they’re “dismayed” that $2.3 billion in federal aid is at risk because of low funding for K-12 schools. Superintendents of the Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay school districts urged lawmakers in a letter to set aside partisan differences and do what’s best for schools. The state budget being written by the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee does not include enough funding for K-12 schools to ensure that Wisconsin would be able to keep $2.3 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they will ensure the funding wouldn’t be lost. The budget committee plans to complete its work this week. As it stands, the new budget would include $128 million more in state funding for K-12 schools than the current one, which is about one-tenth of what Democratic Gov. Tony Evers requested. Evers and Democrats have urged lawmakers to spend more on K-12 schools, especially in light of rosier projections showing the state will collect $4.4 billion more in taxes than originally expected.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A recycled wooden sculpture of an enormous troll now lounges in Rendezvous Park. It’s the brainchild of Copenhagen artist Thomas Dambo, who has built trolls all over the world. Their whimsical construction beckons spectators to clamber aboard and, in the case of R Park, serves as a bridge to ferry the fun from the park to a nearby miniature island, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Dambo named the Jackson Hole troll “Mama Mimi,” for her motherly guidance – plus, he said, Mimi is a “good, strong” Scandinavian name. “I’m super happy with it,” the artist said of his 80th piece. Mimi is one of the few female trolls in Dambo’s small army, and apart from one tucked in a fjord, she’s the first to interact so closely with water. Mimi’s face and feet were assembled at the artist’s Denmark workshop, but everything else was mapped out and assembled on site. Her hair is made entirely of driftwood roots found washed up on the banks of the Snake River. Rather than buying lumber that’s been shipped across the country, he used leftover pallets from Osprey Beverages, saving them from the dumpster. Mimi’s signature stone necklace was sourced from the river and a team member who offered up an old, oversized rope as a band. Set back a quarter-mile or so from the bridge, Mimi won’t be collecting any toll money from travelers, but she did cost a pretty penny: roughly $50,000 raised by an army of #Trollbackers, plus another $50,000 from private donors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}]}

And in Indian River, there was a similar big push of water from the ocean into Indian River Bay.\n\nAnd there was probably another factor, said Anthony P. Pratt, the state's shoreline and waterway administrator.\n\nThere was a full moon over the weekend and that probably caused slightly higher than normal tides before the storm was factored in, he said.\n\nPlus, Pratt and Powell said, it's been a while since we've experienced a nor'easter along the Delaware coast.\n\nOn Wednesday, a cold air mass will come down from the north and could cause some of the precipitation to change to snow Wednesday afternoon into the evening, however, little to no accumulation is expected.\n\nAs for this storm, Delaware got lucky – again. The storm tracked further east than earlier forecast pushing much of the storm's impact toward New Jersey and New England, Pratt said.\n\nStill, for many Delawareans, the post-storm condition of the beaches along both Delaware Bay and the Atlantic Ocean may be a shock.\n\n\"They will look very diminished,\" Pratt said.\n\nAs the first significant nor'easter of the season, this storm caused the beach to shift from the broader, flatter summer profile to a shorter beach with a greater offshore sand bar, he said.\n\nAlong the ocean coast, the dunes held and no beach fencing was washed out, he said.\n\nPratt said that he hadn't visited Delaware Bay communities yet but expected troublesome areas like Broadkill Beach would have both sand loss and flooding from this storm.\n\nA beach renourishment project is set to begin in Broadkill in the coming months.\n\n\"Right now we're still very vulnerable,\" Pratt said.\n\nAt Kitts Hummock along Delaware Bay southeast of Dover, the storm chewed away a bit more of the settlement's already scant beach.\n\n\"There's not much out there now,\" said Roger Goodwin, visiting a relative's home on the harder-hit south end of Kitts. \"You don't go very far out of the house and then it's, I'd say, about a 4 ½-foot dropoff.\"\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has hauled relatively small amounts of sand to protect the 1.1 mile shoreline, in what has been a precarious holding action.\n\nA state-commissioned report released in early 2010 estimated that about $1.7 million and nearly 200,000 cubic yards of sand – or about 20,000 small dump-truck loads, would be needed to restore the beach to a condition that would last about 10-years between replenishments. Another 118,000 cubic yards would be required each decade.\n\nArmy Corps of Engineers records in Philadelphia show that the agency issued DNREC a beach replenishment permit for Kitts Hummock in March.\n\nAnd at vulnerable Broadkill, the start of a much-anticipated sand pumping project has been delayed until later this year.\n\n\"It's just as well they weren't here for this blow,\" said Jim Bailey, president of the Broadkill Beach Preservation Association.\n\nBailey said there was beach erosion but little flooding in the community east of Milton.\n\n\"It could have been a lot worse,\" he said. As it was, waves were 6 to 7 feet along the Delaware Bay, he said. And there was some beach erosion.\n\nMuch of the flooding came from marsh areas. In Lewes, the Lewes & Rehoboth Canal overflowed its banks and sent water cascading over Savannah Road. Also flooded was American Legion Road.\n\nAnd along Del. 1 south of Dewey Beach, there were patches of high water from Rehoboth Bay. Among the trouble spots: Read Avenue in Dewey Beach, where rising water from the bay flooded almost the entire street.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Delaware Department of Transportation reported flooding at Silver Run Road (east of Odessa) and River Road (east of Millsboro) from Layton Davis Road to Orchard Road. Motorists are also asked to use caution on Rt. 1 northbound just north of the Indian River Inlet Bridge because of sand on the roadway and Prime Hook Road north of Broadkill Beach due to water on the roadway, but those areas remain open and passable, DelDOT's website says.\n\nReach Molly Murray at 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

But the flow of vehicles around businesses just west of the Jupiter Inlet will get worse before it gets better. Businesses along Alternate A1A are bracing for herds of cars funneling over from U.S. 1, while restaurants and shops on the east side of the bridge are hoping business won’t quiet down too much.\n\nHere's what lies ahead into 2024 and beyond.\n\nCar crashes in Jupiter:These 5 roads had the most wrecks during 2022.\n\nWhere it's always 5 o'clock:Jupiter's most famous waterfront bar turns 20 in 2023.

And when can I drive on it again?\n\nThe state has offered Johnson Bros., the Florida general contractor taking on the reconstruction, huge incentives to keep the project on a tight schedule. Town and state officials know the burden the closure will bring to local traffic for the 20-month reconstruction, but it can’t be done any other way.\n\nThe bridge isn’t big enough to work on one side at a time and still effectively redirect four lanes of traffic down to two. And there’s no space to construct a new bridge next to it. Since the only way forward is the most inconvenient, Johnson Bros. will get a $3.5 million bonus if it can have one lane of traffic in each direction completed by July 25, 2024.\n\nThe detour phase is scheduled to end in the fall of 2024 and all four lanes of traffic will be reopened to drivers by the spring of 2025 and finished in 2026.\n\nNorthbound drivers will be redirected to use Alternate A1A via Indiantown Road. Southbound traffic will use the same route, using Alternate A1A to reconnect to U.S. 1 via its intersection at Indiantown across the Intracoastal Waterway bridge.\n\nThe new bridge will let taller boats pass under it en route to the ocean\n\nThe plans to give the bridge a facelift have been churning through Jupiter and Tequesta’s council meetings for years. It has been due for an update since 2014, when an inspection deemed the bridge's structure insufficient.\n\nThe bridge was last updated in 1958, when Jupiter's population totaled about 1,000 and Tequesta's hovered near 100. It also was a time when boats plying the local waters were smaller. The current bridge has a vertical clearance of 25 feet. With the reconstruction the clearance will rise to 42 feet, 7 feet taller than Indiantown Road’s bridge across the Intracoastal.\n\nThe increase in vertical clearance will allow more boats to pass under the bridge without having to open and stop the flow of car and truck traffic over it, as often as it does now.\n\n'A devastating loss':Pilot who died in Lantana crash left new wife, child on the way\n\n'Miracle' baby in Boca:Among smallest ever born at 12 ounces, she's headed home with mom\n\nShe was 19 months old:Parents sue Airbnb after toddler dies from fentanyl at Wellington vacation rental\n\nEngineers will monitor traffic in the 'Smart Work Zone' via livestream\n\nBusinesses nestled around the waterfront on the east side of the bridge near Jupiter Inlet Colony, like The Square Grouper and Charlie & Joe's at Love Street, are prepared for the possibility of fewer visitors from Tequesta during the 20-month shutdown.\n\nThe staff at Charlie & Joe's, a waterfront cmplex featuring four restaurants, are optimistic that regardless of the bridge closure, the Jupiter lighthouse and restaurants across the inlet will remain a destination for tourists and locals on both sides of the bridge.\n\n\"We have exciting community events happening in the spring and summer months that are value-driven and charitable,\" said Liz Soulen, director of operations at Charlie & Joe's.\n\nBut businesses along the Alternate A1A detour, like Blackbird Modern Asian Restaurant, Papichulo Tacos and the Lighthouse Diner, can expect waves of new traffic headed their way.\n\nState officials said the Alternate A1A detour is one it knew would pose an issue for Jupiter and Tequesta residents and business owners. To mitigate congestion, FDOT’s traffic management center has labeled the U.S. 1 Bridge Reconstruction detour as a “Smart Work Zone.” This means that from a room full of monitors playing live traffic footage at the management center, FDOT will monitor the detour route to watch for backups and safety problems.\n\n“We have engineers that are going to optimize traffic signals in the area to decrease the impact to the public,” Daniel Smith, an FDOT operations manager, said in a video. “We have people watching our cameras to observe any safety issues that might pop up.

Rather than completely prohibiting motorists, residents in Sussex are encouraged to use extra caution while driving and to stay at home if all possible until the storm is over.\n\nOcean View and South Bethany police rescued a driver trapped in his vehicle due to high waters on Island Drive on Saturday morning, according to Cpl. Rhys Bradshaw with the Ocean View Police Department.\n\nRoute 1 is currently closed both northbound and southbound between Dewey Beach and Bethany Beach due to flooding, according to Delaware's Department of Transportation. Sussex County EMS reports as of 10 a.m., the highway was closed in both directions at the Indian River Inlet Bridge.\n\nNew Road in Lewes is also closed at the intersection at Canary Creek Drive due to high water.\n\nResidents in Dewey Beach are taking to social media to show the extent of the floods, with one local claiming a sand dune was breached, allowing for water to flow onto the roadways.\n\nCrews blocked off a portion of Route 1 in Fenwick Island past the intersection of James Street as of Saturday morning, as well.\n\nLocally, the area is seeing a number of roadways begin to be affected by the storm, with roads washed out due to high tides such as in Ocean View and Rehoboth Beach.\n\nPower Outages\n\nAs of 9 a.m. Saturday, Delaware Electric Co-op reported that 1,200 homes served by the electric company in Sussex County were without power, with 600 of those in Long Neck alone.\n\nAs of 11 a.m., Delmarva Power reported about 70 homes with power outages in eastern Sussex County, mostly scattered from Georgetown to South Bethany.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/04/15/bridge-legal/25849097/", "title": "I-495 bridge damage: Delaware tries to recover costs", "text": "Jeff Montgomery\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation is moving ahead with an attempt to recover some of the nearly $43 million spent on I-495 emergency bridge repairs in Wilmington last year, drawing up a demand for insurance coverage details from those potentially responsible for damaging the span.\n\nAlma Properties LLC, Port Contractors and owners of Keogh Contracting are targets in the coverage demand, said DelDOT spokesman Geoff Sundstrom.\n\nOfficials with the companies could not be reached Wednesday.\n\nState officials on June 2 ordered the I-495 bridge over the Christina River shut down in east Wilmington after lanes were found to be tilting along northbound and southbound approach spans immediately south of the waterway.\n\nHuge backups developed in the first days of the detour as motorists were caught without good alternatives. Long snarls continued, especially during rush hours, throughout the summer.\n\nAn investigation tied the shifting to an unauthorized soil stockpile dumped by Keogh alongside key bridge supports. The mass of material compressed soft soils around deep foundation piles, damaging them and the bases of some concrete supports, throwing the spans off balance.\n\nKeogh is owned by James B. Thomas Jr., son of a founder of Port Contractors, the company that leased the DuPont Co.-owned land where Keogh dumped the soil. Port Contractors also has an interest in Alma, which owns land in the area and was reported to have dealt with Keogh for unrelated operations nearby.\n\nFederal money paid most of the repair costs, with DelDOT covering about $1 million.\n\nThe state's efforts will be handled by Ober Kaler, a legal firm that operates nationally and represented the state previously in a high-cost liability claim for a soil foundation failure during replacement of the Indian River Inlet bridge in coastal Sussex County.\n\nSundstrom said that a DelDOT attorney and representatives from Ober Kaler met with lawyers for all three in late March to discuss a damage settlement short of litigation.\n\n\"Of course, we would like to see not only Delaware but the federal government made whole,\" Sundstrom said, \"but it's recognized that that may not be feasible, outside of insurance payments.\"\n\n\"There is the possibility of bankrupting responsible parties in any litigation of this type. If that were to happen, the state would have difficulty recovering money,\" Sundstrom said.\n\nOther breakdowns could complicate talks in any potential litigation as well.\n\nThe traffic disruptions drew national attention, an emergency declaration and assistance from the Federal Highway Administration and a nationwide call-out for key supplies needed to straighten and repair the bridge. In July, the broken span became part of the backdrop when President Barack Obama traveled to the nearby Port of Wilmington for a speech on the need to boost spending on the nation's infrastructure.\n\nThe city of Wilmington never approved or noted the stockpiling despite its requirement for erosion-control permits for large soil accumulations. Much of the soil was deposited on private land adjacent to the unmonitored and narrow state-owned right-of-way for bridge supports; DelDOT quickly checked or inspected areas under all its larger spans and tightened oversight after the I-495 incident.\n\nChristopher M. Davis, an attorney who is representing victims in the collapse of the Skagit River Bridge along I-5 north of Seattle in May 2013, said on Wednesday, \"You get accusations back and forth among potential defendants on who's responsible or more responsible\" in such cases.\n\nIn February, the state of Washington filed a $17 million lawsuit to recover its costs when part of the Skagit Bridge collapsed after it was hit by part of an oversized load on a truck. Investigators said that a warning pole on a pilot vehicle hit an overhead brace, but no warning was sent to the truck driver, who police said was not permitted for the height of his load.\n\n\"The trucking company is arguing that the state shares some of the blame because it failed to maintain the bridge up to current standards, from an engineering perspective and maintenance perspective, which led to the complete failure,\" Davis said. \"Mainly, they're saying the bridge should not have collapsed had the state done its job.\"\n\nIn the Indian River Inlet case, DelDOT settled for $5.25 million after seeking $19.6 million for its losses after discovering in 2007 that that the earthen foundation of a planned new bridge approach had started settling in unpredicted and unsafe ways almost immediately after placement.\n\nThe state eventually canceled the $34 million bridge contract, with $21 million already spent, and then went on to build the $150 million Charles W. Cullen bridge over the inlet, completed in 2012.\n\nContact Jeff Montgomery at (302) 463-3344 or jmontgomery@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/29/thursday-live-updates-heres-how-hurricane-ian-impacting-brevard/10455420002/", "title": "Thursday live updates: Here's how Hurricane Ian is impacting Brevard", "text": "Keeping you prepared during the storm is important to us.

Portable generators are powering some sewage lift station. Morrison said the city distributed almost 1,000 sandbags before the storm and used a pump to clear water from areas with a history of flooding. He said the Banana Rive remained high and was splashing over the seawall on the city’s west side. “Overall, we did good,” Morrison said. “But a heavy rain would probably cause problems because our stormwater system is working hard.”\n\n— John McCarthy\n\n12:00 p.m.: Brevard Public Schools —no damage reported\n\nBPS says no damage has been reported, though staff hasn't visited every school yet due to road conditions.\n\n— Bobby Block\n\n11:30 a.m.: Flooding in Titusville\n\nTitusville is experiencing flooding in some areas of the city.

A turn toward the north is expected late today, followed by a turn toward the north-northwest with an increase in forward speed Friday night.\n\nOn the forecast track, Ian will approach the coast of South Carolina on Friday. The center will move farther inland across the Carolinas Friday night and Saturday. Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 70 mph (110 km/h) with higher gusts. Ian is expected to become a hurricane again this evening and make landfall as a hurricane on Friday, with rapid weakening forecast after landfall.\n\nA Tropical Storm Warning is in effect from Jupiter Inlet, Florida to Duck, North Carolina\n\n11:15 a.m.: Causeways remain open\n\nBrevard County's seven causeways remain open and will not be closed at any point due to Hurricane Ian, county spokesman Don Walker said.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the causeways do not close at any point before or during a major storm, but may sometimes be closed after a storm to assess potential damage. But no damage was expected based on the rated windspeeds across the county, which were not high enough to cause concern, Walker said.\n\n\"We don't even need to inspect them,\" Walker said. \"The wind speeds didn't get high enough.\"\n\n— Eric Rogers\n\n11:02 a.m.: Be careful on the roads in Cocoa\n\nCocoa Police reported multiple hazards along roadways Thursday morning, including a downed powerline at the Dixon Boulevard and railroad crossing, trees down and blocking the roads at MacFarland Drive and North Indian River Drive and 1630 Ridge Drive.

All are still in HURCON I status, which is the highest storm readiness level.\n\nThe gate to the Cape is still closed, but the main gate into Patrick remains open. At KSC, all gates remain closed.\n\n\"Space Launch Delta 45 is currently in HURCON 1C status, meaning recovery and response teams have not yet been dispatched to perform assessments at either installation (Patrick Space Force Base and Cape Canaveral Space Force Station),” SLD 45 said in a statement. “Preliminary reports sound like there is minimal damage and impact from the storm. Once we reach HURCON 1R status, and it is safe to do so, our teams will perform assessments and we will have a report out as quickly as possible.”\n\n— Emre Kelly\n\n10:19 a.m.: BCSO to send assistance to Lee County\n\nThe Brevard County Sheriff's Office is sending a team to assist in Lee County on Florida's west coast, where Hurricane Ian roared ashore as a strong Category 4 storm Wednesday, causing catastrophic damage and flooding, according to Don Walker, director of communications for Brevard.\n\nWalker said the county has also received a request from nearby Osceola County to help with its emergency management operations, \"but we'll wait until we are on the other side of the storm ourselves to make a decision on that,\" he said.\n\n— Eric Rogers\n\n10:10 a.m.:County asks residents to limit water usage\n\nBrevard County officials are asking residents to reduce water usage, as rains continue from Hurricane Ian. Brevard County Utilities said residents are asked to reduce water usage, especially flushing toilets, doing laundry and taking long showers.\n\nLimiting water usage will help reduce the chances of backups into residents' homes, and into the streets and rivers.\n\n— Dave Berman\n\n9:55 a.m.: Power issues being worked\n\nFlorida Power and Light crews are working to restore power to Brevard County residents in the wake of Hurricane Ian.\n\nAbout 58,000 customers are currently without power, down from about 70,000 at 7 a.m. Thursday, according to the aggregated outage tracking website poweroutage.us.\n\n— Eric Rogers\n\n9:53 a.m.: Cocoa resident shares his experiences\n\nMark Fink found his storm experience to be pretty mild, he said as he walked his dog along Indian River Drive near heavy flooding south of Blacks Road.\n\nHe said he would never have bought a home along the low lying parts of the roadway and chose his home specifically for the high ground.\n\n“We anticipated it pretty well. My whole back yard’s a big lake now, you could canoe in it,” he said.\n\n— Tyler Vazquez\n\n9:24 a.m.: Cocoa Beach working issues\n\nCocoa Beach tweeted at 9:16 a.m. that their public safety crews had found eight power lines and one cable line down, six traffic lights out and one building with possible structural damage.\n\nThey did not immediately specify the locations of these hazards.\n\n— Finch Walker\n\n9:18 a.m.: More updates from Cocoa\n\nWater seemed to spill right over the edge of the lagoon and onto the roads and front yards of houses along Indian River Drive on Thursday in the areas where the curvy water side drive dips down as if to invite flooding.\n\nA stop sign was set up on Dixon Boulevard to prevent motorists from driving into the heavily flooded roadway as utility workers surveyed the situation nearby.\n\nTraffic backed up on Indian River drive farther north past State Road 528 where heavy flooding mostly submerged mailboxes and the lagoons waters splashed against the coquina.\n\n— Tyler Vazquez\n\n9:10 a.m.: Indialantic damage report; lots of power out\n\nAs of 9 a.m., Indialantic Mayor Dave Berkman estimated about 95% of his town was still without electricity after Ian’s overnight gusts.\n\n“We had multiple power lines down in town, several across A1A,” he said.\n\nNo injuries were reported in Indialantic, and no serious structural damages were reported, Berkman said.\n\nRising floodwater approached a few homes north of Fifth Avenue near the Indian River Lagoon, he said. But no homes were flooded, to his knowledge.\n\n“Basically, we dodged a bullet. We’ve got lots of palm fronds down, a few trees. But overall, we came out very well,” Berkman said.\n\n— Rick Neale\n\n9:08 a.m.: Updates still paint 'incomplete picture'\n\nBrevard County Emergency Management Director John Scott said early reports of little major flooding or damage from Hurricane Ian were promising, but an \"incomplete picture.\"\n\n\"My expectation is that will tick up as the sun comes up,\" Scott said during a Thursday morning briefing to county emergency operations teams. \"We won't get a good idea of where we are until about noon.\"\n\n\"There is still some of Ian to go,\" he said.\n\n— Eric Rogers\n\n9:06 a.m. Cocoa Beach residents warned against flushing\n\nCoco Beach said in a tweet at about 8:40 a.m. Thursday that the sewer system from Kent Drive to State Road 520 was at max capacity, warning residents not to flush their toilets or use water.\n\nAbout an hour and a half earlier, the city tweeted that city staff was performing “post storm assessments” of the streets and asked residents to shelter in place, advising them not to walk or drive through standing water.\n\nMore info is upcoming from the city.\n\n— Finch Walker\n\n9:04 a.m.: Lights out in Melbourne\n\nAs of 7 a.m. Friday, 10 traffic signals across the city of Melbourne remained disabled or on “flash mode” from Ian’s winds, said Cheryl Mall, city spokesperson.\n\n“Overnight, there were a few reports of downed trees and traffic signals out.

Traffic on S.R. 528 itself was not impeded in either direction, he said.\n\nOfficials are warning people to avoid the intersection and find alternate routes to the Beachline.\n\n\"If you're traveling west on 520, you could find yourself in some deep water,\" Walker said.\n\n— Eric Rogers\n\n8:32 a.m.: Early reports show Cocoa Beach spared\n\nCocoa Beach officials are still compiling a damage report, but the city seemed to avoid serious damage Mayor Ben Malik said.\n\nHe did say there were some downed power lines and isolated flooding in the area.\n\nCity officials were asking drivers to stay off the roads while first responders conduct their damage assessment. “We got lucky!” Malik wrote in a text message to FLORIDA TODAY.\n\n— John McCarthy\n\n8:30 a.m.: More damage from around the county\n\nHurricane Ian caused scattered damage throughout Brevard County, according to reports being compiled by county officials.\n\nAmong the initial reports were the following, according to Brevard County Communications Director Don Walker:\n\n• Structure damage: A house lost a roof in Barefoot Bay and a carport was damaged by a falling tree in Cocoa.\n\n• Power lines down: Reported in Cocoa Beach, Melbourne, Satellite Beach and Viera.\n\n• Road flooding: On U.S. 1 in Mims, side streets in Satellite Beach, and near the on and off ramps from State Road 528 to State Road 520.\n\n• Tree fires caused by power lines: In Grant-Valkaria and Indian Harbour Beach.\n\n— Dave Berman\n\n8:28 a.m.: Blockages in Cocoa\n\nIn Cocoa, there are downed power lines at the railroad crossing at Dixon Blvd. near U.S. 1 on the southwest side of the tracks. The road is not passable and officers are blocking the road.\n\nOther updates include:\n\n• Traffic lights out at Clearlake and Dixon.\n\n• McFarland/N. Indian River Dr.: Tree down blocking roadway\n\n• N.

It could be because Ian's eye was centered right over Brevard at 8 a.m., as evidenced by this latest graphic:\n\nDon't let your guard down. Strong winds and rain are still possible. Stay off the roads if you don't need to be out and about. Flooding, blocked roads and other assessments are still being done.\n\nKeep in mind, tropical storm force winds are still possible, as evidenced by this latest graphic.\n\n8:06 a.m.: Downtown Melbourne makes it through OK\n\nAt daybreak Thursday, no apparent structural damages from Ian’s winds were visible during a cursory drive through downtown Melbourne. And street lamps remained lit along the New Haven Avenue commercial corridor.\n\nBrowned palm fronds and tree branch debris littered downtown streets, and a couple of sidewalk planters tipped over outside The Sun Shoppe & Café.\n\nMelbourne Avenue — a historically flood-prone street — was practically free of standing water in its low-lying spots by 7:30 a.m., even along the Promenade Park manatee-viewing area fronting Crane Creek.\n\n— Rick Neale\n\n7:55 a.m.: If you need to get to the Turnpike, know this\n\nFlorida Highway Patrol has closed the Florida Turnpike in both directions from mile markers 254 through 267 due to significant flooding.\n\nThe northbound lanes are closed from mile marker 254 and the southbound lanes are closed from mile marker 267.\n\nThis area of the Turnpike in Orange County will remain closed until the storm passes and the flooding subsides.\n\nShould motorists need to travel Thursday and Friday they should confirm the availability of their route by checking Florida Highway Patrol Current Traffic Incidents (flhsmv.gov) or FL511| Florida Traffic | Commuter Information.\n\n— FHP\n\n7:46 a.m.: Images of damage\n\nFLORIDA TODAY's experienced photography team of Malcom Denemark, Tim Shortt and Craig Bailey will be bringing you amazing pictures throughout the day.\n\nDenemark (Denny as he's known) just delivered this photo from Sunset Cafe, along the banks of the Banana River along 520 in Cocoa Beach.\n\nStay tuned and we'll have a photo gallery posted soon.\n\n7:18 a.m.: Ian downgraded\n\nHurricane Ian is now Tropical Storm Ian.

Or will they survive recent nor'easter?", "text": "Among those in the know, most local anglers trace the lack of sand fleas to a nasty nor’easter that pummeled our shores in November of 2021.\n\nMost, not all. More on that shortly.\n\nThe sand flea — a versatile and therefore highly popular bait along coastlines and even inshore — loves to play in the shallow waters along the tide’s edge. They happily flow in with the waves — “weeee” — but the wave retreats, exposes the flea, and fun gives way to panic as the sand flea burrows a hole and disappears.\n\nShow of hands, who hasn’t wanted to do that from time to time?\n\nThings aren’t always better out in deeper water for the sand flea. Turns out, the flea is a favorite snack for one of the most coveted coastal fish out there — the pompano. But it’s not just the pompano, but many other shellfish-craving swimmers lust for the flea because, we’re told, they’re dandy fare.\n\nWell, first came talk of the sand fleas returning “up north,” as in Flagler County. Down on this side of the county line, along the shore, some surf-anglers were importing fleas — either heading up to gather some themselves or, you know, maybe they know a guy who knows a guy.\n\nEventually, yes, sand fleas began rooting around our Volusia County beaches and, lo and behold, showing up again in area bait shops.\n\n“In the past couple weeks, they’ve been abundant enough for the commercial guys to harvest them again,” says Craig Patterson, who owns and operates Donald’s Bait & Tackle on the Port Orange Causeway.\n\n“Pompano is the most popular fish they’re used for, with sheepshead a close second,” Craig says. “But redfish, black drum and mangrove snapper love them, too.”\n\nFresh and alive is better, always, but some fishermen see no dropoff in performance with frozen fleas. And with their hard bodies and shell, they’re not so prone to slipping off the hook.\n\nMaybe best of all, this is the one tried-and-true bait you can catch yourself without a boat, without a castnet and, frankly, without much effort. Yes, a flea rake makes life much easier for Uncle Ed and his cranky spine, but turn it into a game for the kids, and before you know it, you’re filling up a bucket.\n\nPlenty of research online will tell you how to handle and fish with the flea — either that day or in the future — so never overlook this funky little beauty.\n\nBut also, don’t take the flea for granted. They disappeared on us before, and some are fearful of what this past week’s strong northeast winds might’ve done to the flea population as the scarred coastline was once again pummeled.\n\n“Hopefully, the high tides don’t affect them in a negative way,” Patterson says.\n\nRemember how we said most locals blame the 2021 nor’easter?\n\nIn Palm Coast, Capt. Mike Vickers blames those pesky unintended consequences. He says beach renourishment, all with good intentions, had a negative impact.\n\n“We’re trucking in fine-grain sand, and sand fleas thrive in coarse sand,” he says. “Fine-grain sand compacts and smothers them. The storms simply pull this sand down off the dunes and out into the surf, covering the preferred coarse sand, causing the kills.”\n\nPumping coarse sand in for replenishment would be better and more natural, Capt. Mike suggests — “let nature rebuild its ecology” — but it’s also more expensive.\n\nDepressed yet? Well, here’s more. The sand fleas that began showing up again have been rather small, and in a perfect world would’ve been left alone to grow in size and number. The world ain’t perfect.\n\nThe coming week and better weather will tell us what, if anything, the recent onslaught did to the fledgling sand flea population.\n\nIt’s not often you pull for a flea, you know.\n\nHalifax/Indian River\n\nOver the past several days, you had to really want to be on the water to be on the water. Maybe it was your only day off in a month. Maybe friends were in town for just a day and really wanted to get out there.\n\nOr maybe you’re a professional guide and have bills to pay.\n\nAt ramps and marinas up and down the intracoastal, customers with offshore hopes and dreams were being told of changes in plans — there’s no getting out of the inlet in these winds, so we’re staying inshore, tucking tight to the mangroves, and letting the snapper and amberjack live to see another day.\n\n“Well, the wind started cranking along with some rain here and there, making it a little tougher to fish some areas, but fishing has been productive,” says Capt. Jeff Patterson (Pole Dancer). “Quite a few pompano in the river between Daytona and the inlet.”\n\nCapt. Jeff also says undersized reds are being found in small clusters, while jacks and ladyfish are still in a springtime frenzy. After dark, bridges and piers are still a gathering spot for snook.\n\nCapt. Billy Pettigrew (RedfishTails.com) looks on the bright side during weeks like this.\n\n“With the high water and these winds, the water won't be dirty, which is a good thing,” he says. “This wind helps take pressure off the fish. With both high winds and water, it will move the fish around, so we’re gonna need to do a little searching. But once you find them they should be chewing.”\n\nAs things improve Friday and Saturday, you should easily (OK, fairly easily) find mangrove snapper around the Dunlawton bridge, either from boat or the fishing pier, says Craig Patterson.\n\nTrout will go after live shrimp, and croakers should be attracting snook, Craig says.\n\n“Other regular inshore catches are pompano, red and black drum, sheepshead and flounder,” Craig says of the springtime norm. “Bonnethead sharks are also being caught from the Dunlawton piers and flat bridge.”\n\nSurf\n\nLonger-range forecasts suggest Sunday could be a washout, but before and after looks pretty good, especially compared to this week’s tree-bending howls.\n\n“There’s been no fishing this week on the beaches that I can tell,” Marco Pompano tells us. “The wind is ferocious, with gusts up to 40. The currents are moving much too fast for any weights to hold, and the waves are gigantic.\n\n“It’s too bad, because the fish were really biting very well a few days ago.\"\n\nFlagler\n\nJust as we can’t fight City Hall, fish can’t fight nature’s flexing of leverage.\n\n“Since the storm and high water, the river has been a rough go and the fish and bait is pushed up in the back of the creeks, canals, and flats,” says Capt. Mike Vickers. “After this week, expect this pattern to hold until the water levels start to drop.”\n\nWhen sanity ensues, he adds, expect the usual April menu to present itself, including reds, trout, snook and hopefully the first serious signs of tarpon.\n\nSame goes for Matanzas Inlet, where some talk of nearshore kingfish was being heard, and where rays around the inlet were signaling a flow of cobia into the area.\n\nSt. Johns\n\n“You can catch fish out there. They’re still catching specks. Not burning it up, but you can still catch some.”\n\nSo says Capt. James Hillman (Highland Park in DeLand), who’s awaiting more favorable conditions and some targeting of the sporty shellcracker in the coming week or two.\n\nShellcracker are the kinda-sorta jack crevalle of freshwater panfish, only better tasting. In the panfish lineup, shellcracker would bat cleanup. Its power and pull separates it from the others.\n\n“They’re a little bigger and fight about twice as hard,” Capt. James says. “If they got up to 5, 6, 7 pounds, you never could catch one. You couldn’t handle it.”\n\nCapt. James was glad to see some rain come in, and is hoping for more. The canals and lakes need it, he says.\n\n“We haven’t had much rain over here since November,” he says, pointing back to last fall’s hurricanes that swelled the St. Johns to historic heights.\n\n“We went from water being five feet over the docks, to now, where you can grow a garden in ’em.”\n\nNot so fast and loose with the rain hopes, says Kerry McPherson several miles north in Astor. Kerry spent most of the late fall and winter drying out and cleaning his South Moon Fish Camp, just north of the Astor bridge. He’s all for needed rain, but let’s not overdo it.\n\nHis water level has been up due to those strong east winds, which always reverse the St. Johns flow, pushing the water from north to south and, along the way, reversing the fortunes of even the best anglers.\n\n“The wind has messed everything up,” Kerry says. “Last week, everything was good. Had guys catching specks, limiting out, limiting on bream … stripers did very well. We also had a full moon, so everything turns on.”\n\nIn the coming weeks, his welcome mat will go out for the steady flow of out-of-state fishermen who come in like clockwork for a couple of freshwater delights.\n\n“Bluegill and shellcracker are next,” Kerry says.\n\nAnd completing our northbound run, up Crescent City way, Thomas Delaney says the bluegill were already showing themselves, with water temps hitting the low-80s.\n\n“I’m curious to see how this front affects them,” says Thomas, who has been playing cat-and-mouse with this past week’s gusts.\n\n“You can find areas to wiggle your way out of it,” he says.\n\nOffshore tournament\n\nAnother reminder of the 22nd annual Offshore Challenge, coming April 21, 22 and 23, and sponsored by the Halifax Sport Fishing Club in Port Orange.\n\nWahoo, mahi and king mackerel are the targets, and participating captains can fish just one of the tournament’s three days.\n\nMore info at the club’s website: HSFC.com.\n\nHook, line and clicker: Send us your fish pics\n\nWe want to see your most recent catch.

But the basics are: No: If you're 65 or older, 15 or younger, you don't need a license. No: If you're fishing with a licensed guide or charter boat, both of which purchase commercial licenses that cover their customers. Yes: Most everyone else, including visitors from other states. Yes: Even if you're a shore-based angler (shoreline, dock, pier, bridge, etc.). However: The shore-based license is free . . . But: You still need to register for that free license.\n\nWhere do I get a license and what does it cost?\n\nMany bait shops sell licenses, as do the bigger retailers (Bass, Dick's, Walmart, etc.). Florida's FWC uses a third-party site for buying or renewing fishing licenses: GoOutdoorsFlorida.com. The cost: $17 for an annual license. Don't forget: Whether you're fishing fresh or saltwater, you need the specific license. Freshwater and saltwater licenses are both $17 annually.\n\nI’m here on vacation, do I need a license?\n\nYes you do, and they're also available at GoOutdoorsFlorida.com or certain bait shops and big retailers. Cost: $17 for three days, $30 for seven days, $47 for a year.Also: Non-residents need to purchase that license even if they're just fishing from shoreline or shore-based structures.

Another 1,800 customers in Lee County and 700 in Brevard County did not have power.\n\nFor the full story, go here.\n\n— Hannah Morse\n\nMunicipalities across Palm Beach County announce closures ahead of Nicole's landfall\n\nIn northern Palm Beach County, Juno Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Tequesta each closed their municipal halls Wednesday in anticipation of effects from Tropical Storm Nicole.\n\nPalm Beach Gardens announced that City Hall will remain closed through Thursday, as will the Burns Road Community Center, the Tennis & Pickleball Center, Sandhill Crane Golf Club and city parks.\n\nThe Aquatics Center is scheduled to reopen from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Friday. The Tennis & Pickleball Center will reopen Friday, if the weather permits.\n\nIn Jupiter, the town hall, community center and three parks — Jupiter Community Park, Cinquez Park and Abacoa Community Park — will be closed Wednesday and Thursday, and nonessential services are suspended for both days. Additionally, all athletic fields and facilities located within Jupiter will be closed.\n\nPalm Beach County officials have opened shelters at Jupiter’s Independence Middle School, at Greenway and Jeaga drives in Jupiter's Abacoa community, has been opened as a shelter. Palm Beach Gardens High School, at Holly Drive and Military Trail, also has opened as a shelter.\n\nIn Juno Beach, the town center closed at noon Wednesday and will remain closed until further notice. Tequesta’s village hall and recreation center closed at 8 a.m. Wednesday as a state of emergency was declared.\n\nThe City of Lake Worth Beach closed the William Lockhart Pier, City Library, golf course, city call, 1900 2nd Ave. offices, leisure services office, parking division and the PBSO District 14 headquarters. The Lake Worth Beach complex, including all shops and restaurants are also closed.\n\n— Julius Whigham II\n\n1 p.m. Tropical Storm Nicole update\n\nTropical Storm Nicole made landfall on Great Abaco Island at 11:55 a.m. with sustained winds of 70 mph.\n\nAs of 1 p.m., the system is 175 miles east of West Palm Beach and moving west at 12 mph.\n\nThe storm's track shifted slightly north taking areas from Boynton Beach to Boca Raton out of the for forecast cone. But tropical storm-force winds extend 460 miles from the center, mostly on the northern side of the center.\n\nNicole is forecast to become a hurricane in the next 12 hours before making landfall on Florida's east coast late Wednesday into early Thursday.\n\nThe Juno Beach Pier is closed and was under guard Wednesday afternoon. Town police kept people away from watching the day's unusually strong surf from the 990-foot fishing pier near U.S. 1 and Marcinski Road.\n\nA few people walked the beach instead, taking in the grey, windy scene before Nicole made landfall.\n\nOfficials eyeing Lake Okeechobee as Nicole looms\n\nWith Lake Okeechobee in the potential path of Tropical Storm Nicole, federal officials are checking the untested dike that surrounds it to make sure it can withstand heavy winds and rain.\n\nBut, officials at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers insisted, the Herbert Hoover Dike “is safer today than it has ever been going into a storm.”\n\nIn the last 15 years, roughly $1.5 billion has been spent shoring up the 143-mile levee and building water control structures. The improvements are nearly 97% complete, officials said.\n\nThe lake is now about three feet higher than it was when Hurricane Ian crossed the state in late September, devastating the Gulf Coast and bringing heavy rains to inland counties.\n\nWith the lake level at 16 feet, some “high volume releases” may be needed in the wake of Tropical Storm Nicole, officials said.\n\nThe release of freshwater from the lake has been blamed for polluting nearby saltwater estuaries and spurring blooms of toxic blue-green algae.\n\nThe dike was built to protect residents of The Glades after at least 2,500 people drowned when the lake overflowed its banks in a 1928 hurricane that made landfall in West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm surge hitting north county\n\nFEMA aid will be available\n\nFederal emergency aid will be available to 45 counties, including those in South Florida, that could be impacted by Hurricane Nicole, the Biden Administration announced Wednesday.\n\nThe emergency declaration allows FEMA to mobilize and provide assistance to areas hit by the storm. It also means federal money will be available if recovery efforts are needed.\n\nThe designation covers a wide swath of the eastern and central parts of the state from Miami to Orlando to Jacksonville.\n\nCounties in southeast Florida that were named in the declaration include Palm Beach, Broward, Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River and Okeechobee counties. The designation also covers the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the Seminole Tribe of Florida.About 52,000 in mobile homes and 67,000 residents on barrier islands weree ordered to evacuate beginning at 7 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nFree rides to shelters available in Palm Beach County\n\nPalm Beach County is providing free transportation to take homeless people to shelters before Hurricane Nicole strikes today.\n\nRides will be offered at noon at the following locations:\n\nBryant Park off Lake Avenue in Lake Worth Beach\n\nPhil Foster Park on Blue Heron Boulevard in Riviera Beach\n\nCurrie Park on Flagler Drive in West Palm Beach\n\nDelray Beach Public Library on Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach\n\nNo rides will be offered later this afternoon as tropical force winds are expected to make travel unsafe. Those with questions or concerns can call the county’s Emergency Information Center at 561-712-6400.\n\nFor information on what to bring to hurricane evacuation shelters, visit https://bit.ly/3tgsklH.\n\nFlooding ahead of Tropical Storm Nicole in West Palm Beach, Palm Beach\n\n10 a.m. Tropical Storm Nicole update\n\nTropical Storm Nicole maintained 70 mph sustained winds as of the 10 a.m. advisory from the National Hurricane Center as it moved west at 12 mph.\n\nThe storm, which is expected to become a hurricane today, was 210 miles west of West Palm Beach.\n\nPalm Beach County is already feeling wind gusts to 39 mph at Palm Beach International Airport ahead of Nicole. The storm has a massive spread of tropical storm-force winds to 460 miles from its center.\n\nPalm Beach County began mandatory evacuations of zones A and B, which includes mobile homes, low-lying areas and barrier islands at 7 a.m.\n\nNational Hurricane Center forecasters warned that Nicole's storm surge is causing \"a life-threatening situation\" in areas that have a storm surge warning. That includes North Palm Beach, Jupiter and Juno Beach.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are evacuating. A handful of Palm Beach residents said they planned to stay put despite being in the zone B evacuation area.\n\n\"I don't want to say I have no concerns, but I'm probably not evacuating\" said Sammy Vassallo, who was walking on Worth Avenue Wednesday morning. \"People who ignore the ocean are consumed by it. I have respect for the water.\"\n\nPalm Beach County residents get ready for Tropical Storm Nicole\n\nLines were longer than usual at 9 a.m. Wednesday at Aldi on Okeechobee Boulevard in West Palm Beach, according to store employees. The store just implemented self-checkout stations, which in some cases have led to confusion from customers and longer lines on a normal day.\n\nThe store, which opened at 8:30 a.m., was fully stocked on bottled water and meat. Some shoppers stocked their carts with produce and perishable items while others grabbed bottled water and canned items.\n\nOne couple weighed whether they could use canned sauerkraut in anything tasty if they lost power due to Tropical Storm Nicole. They decided against it.\n\nOne woman, who didn’t want her name published because she was popping out to the store during her working hours, said she was stocking up on extra bottled water ahead of Nicole. She lives near the store, but not in an evacuation zone, so she said she was planning to stay put through the storm.\n\n“I work Saturday through Wednesday, so I will be staying home anyway,” she said of her job in healthcare.\n\nShe added that she was not terribly worried about Nicole and didn’t plan to put sandbags at her doors or board windows.\n\n“I buy bottled water anyway, so I just got some more today for the storm,” she said.\n\n— Katherine Kokal\n\n7 a.m. Tropical Storm Nicole update, life threatening storm surge\n\nTropical Storm Nicole is closing in on Florida at just 240 miles east of West Palm Beach. At 7 a.m., Nicole had 70 mph sustained winds - just 5 mph shy of making it hurricane strength - and was moving west-southwest at a speedy 13 mph.\n\nNicole has a huge field of damaging winds stretching 460 miles from its center, especially to its north and meteorologists are cautioning not to focus on the cone.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is warning of \"life threatening storm surge\" in areas under a storm surge warning. That includes North Palm Beach, Juno Beach and Jupiter where high waves will be riding on a storm surge that could reach 3 to 5 feet.\n\nPalm Beach County evacuates based on storm surge and has issued mandatory evacuations of zones A and B, which includes barrier islands, mobile homes and low-lying areas.\n\nThe last hurricane to hit the Florida Peninsula in November was the so-called Yankee Hurricane of 1935 that hit near Miami on Nov. 4. The storm was nicknamed Yankee because of it's unusual path from the northeast.\n\n\"Many peculiarities attended this storm aside from its most unusual path,\" a November 1935 Monthly Weather Review says, noting that very little rain fell with the storm. \"Winds of gale force extended northward to West Palm Beach.\"\n\nPalm Beach International Airport anticipates 9 a.m. closing\n\nPalm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach anticipates commercial airline operations will stop at about 9 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nOfficials advise checking with your airline for specific details before coming to the airport. The terminal will be closed to the public following the last departure.\n\nPBI is not a shelter and people should not plan on staying there through the storm. For information on Palm Beach County shelters go to https://www.pbcgov.org/hurricane/.\n\nTropical Storm Nicole nearing hurricane strength as it approaches Bahamas\n\nPalm Beach County is being buffeted by gusty winds that reach a sprawling 460 miles from Tropical Storm Nicole's center as it musters hurricane strength east of the northwestern Bahamas on a path to Florida.\n\nAt 4 a.m. Wednesday, Nicole was a 70 mph tropical storm approaching Great Abaco Island in the northwestern Bahamas.\n\nThe storm, which is expected to reach Florida's east coast as a Category 1 hurricane between Boca Raton and Sebastian was abut 270 miles east of West Palm Beach. It was moving west-southwest at a swift 13 mph.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for Boca Raton to the Flagler/Volusia County line. A storm surge warning is in effect for North Palm Beach to Altamaha Sound, Georgia. A Storm surge watch is in effect for south of North Palm Beach to Hallandale Beach Florida.\n\nPalm Beach County mandatory evacuations begin at 7 a.m. Wednesday for zones A and B, which includes mobile homes, barrier islands and low-lying areas.\n\nShelters also open at 7 a.m. and include Palm Beach Gardens High School, Independence Middle School, Palm Beach Central High School, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Elementary, Park Vista High School, Lake Shore Middle School and Pahokee Middle School. A pet-friendly will open at West Boynton Recreation Center.\n\nNicole will face challenges to reaching Cat 1 status (74 mph winds) including a cold upper-level atmosphere, wind shear and dry air.\n\n“To be clear, there is zero chance that Nicole could blow up into a Hurricane Ian or Dorian,” said Fox Weather hurricane expert Bryan Norcross, who is based in Miami. “I don’t see any likelihood of it being more than a Category 1.”\n\nNonetheless, the official National Hurricane Center forecast has it reaching maximum sustained winds of 75 mph before near the Bahamas and maintaining that strength with 90 mph gusts when it makes landfall in Florida.\n\nSustained tropical storm-force winds could reach Palm Beach County this afternoon. Forecast storm surge heights have not changed from yesterday with 2 to 4 feet expected in Central and South Palm Beach County and 3 to 5 feet from North Palm Beach to Georgia.\n\nKimberly Miller is a veteran journalist for The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA Today Network of Florida.

The answer is still taking shape, given that the thousands of chemicals under this umbrella are considered emerging contaminants and because of a lack of consensus about how much exposure people can tolerate.\n\nHere is what we know about PFAS, in terms of their presence in Indianapolis' water, how they became a part of everyday life, their potential health effects and what can been done to limit our exposure to them.\n\nPFAS in Indianapolis\n\nRecommended and enforced PFAS limits across the country run the gamut.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, requires notice for any drinking water with more than 5.1 to 6.5 parts per trillion of the two most-studied types of PFAS substances, and a Michigan state committee just approved standards ranging from 8 to 16 parts per trillion for the same chemicals.\n\nThe Environmental Working Group and a recent Harvard study argue these standards are still too high. Both suggest the limit should be closer to one part per trillion. This is roughly equivalent to one droplet within an Olympic swimming pool.\n\nOf the cities and counties compared nationwide in the EWG report, Indianapolis' rate of 15 parts per trillion was about average — nearby cities such as Louisville and Columbus, Ohio, showed higher levels of PFAS contamination.\n\nEven so, said EWG senior scientist David Andrews, Indianapolis' water supply showed PFAS levels 15 times higher than the organization's proposed limit.\n\n\"This is information that really should have been made public years ago,\" Andrews said. \"Studies of these chemicals have indicated … just an incredible array of health effects.\"\n\nBut this wasn't the first time the city's water systems had been screened for PFAS. Indianapolis-area water systems were monitored from 2013 to 2015 as part of an EPA program, and no PFAS were detected, said a spokesperson from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.\n\nHowever, the EWG report sampled the water between May and December last year. The organization also says it tested for a wider array of chemicals than the EPA program did, and required reporting at a lower level of compounds than the EPA required.\n\nCurrently, there's no requirement for testing for PFAS, but if there were, IDEM would be the agency with authority over that testing, an agency spokesperson said.\n\nWhat are PFAS chemicals?\n\nThe synthetic chemicals were first used in manufacturing in the 1940s and have reached ubiquity in recent decades.\n\nTwo of these chemicals, known as PFOS and PFOA, were famously used to make Scotchguard and the nonstick coating on Teflon cookware, sparking generations of products using similar materials. This compound has since been phased out.\n\nNevertheless, the materials that contain PFAS are widespread, found in products ranging from microwave popcorn bags to cleaning supplies.\n\nWater:Hoosier National Forest burn could hurt drinking water for 140,000 people, opponents say\n\nContamination:Jet fuel cleanup in Pleasant Run Creek could take weeks, officials say\n\nBecause it takes so long for PFAS chemicals to break down, however, people are exposed to them in even more ways. The chemicals build up in the ground, float in the air and run through rivers.\n\n\"It comes from multiple sources,\" said Linda Lee, an agronomy professor at Purdue University with years of experience researching PFAS. \"And that’s part of the challenge.\"\n\nAs many as 110 million Americans could be drinking from PFAS-contaminated water sources, according to estimates from the EWG, which says about 99% of Americans have the chemicals in their bloodstreams.\n\nA difficulty in addressing this issue, Lee said, is the sparsity of knowledge about the substances themselves.\n\n\"There’s a lot of arguing about how toxic they are, what should the levels be?” Lee said. \"People have no idea how many things they take for granted that they have because of these compounds … but nobody realized how 'forever' they are.”\n\nHealth concerns\n\nAs PFAS chemicals are considered an emerging contaminant, not much is yet known about their exact toll on the body. However, they have been associated with a litany of health problems, including complications to the immune system, higher cholesterol levels, hormonal issues and cancer.\n\nPFAS chemicals take years to break down from the environment and the body, earning them the moniker of \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nThat means that even tiny amounts can over time build up in the blood to levels much higher than in drinking water, said Andrews, from the EWG.\n\n\"These chemicals are found in nearly every water supply. … I think it highlights that it’s nearly impossible if not impossible to avoid exposure to some of these chemicals,\" he said. \"They’ve become unavoidable.\"\n\nAlexis Temkin, EWG toxicologist and author of a recent study that tested 26 PFAS chemicals and found they display characteristics of carcinogens, said there's not enough data on these substances to know their exact connection to disease.\n\nHowever, she said, the results are still cause for concern.\n\n\"Even though these 26 chemicals have the characteristics of carcinogens,\" Temkin said, \"it doesn’t necessarily mean that they cause cancer. It does mean that it’s important to limit exposure.”\n\nState actions\n\nTwo bills addressing PFAS contaminants were introduced in the state legislature this year. One would have required the state to establish maximum contaminant levels for PFAS substances in public water, but it died in committee without being heard.\n\nThe other bill, which aims to limit the substance's use in firefighting foam, passed through the legislature with little to no friction.\n\nThis foam is especially useful for fires from flammable liquids, such as fuels, and would be difficult to stop using entirely. But HB 1189, authored by Rep. Peggy Mayfield, attempts to reduce its use in training and in testing.\n\nLimiting the use of this foam can reduce the amount of chemicals that leach into the ground or water. It's a good first step toward addressing what Mayfield considers a public safety issue.\n\n\"Right now, in Indiana there are no controls over the use of PFAS,\" Mayfield said. \"While some states have been working toward a total ban, I don’t think that we were quite ready as a state.\"\n\nThe bill passed through the legislature unanimously with bipartisan support. On Wednesday, it was signed into law by Gov. Eric Holcomb.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nIt may be next to impossible to limit exposure to PFAS chemicals, particularly if they're in drinking water. However, Temkin said, there are a few measures that might reduce PFAS exposure.\n\nAvoiding packaging, such as sandwich wrappers, grease-resistant food containers and other fast-food or processed food packaging, could help, Temkin said. Stain-resistant carpets, fabrics or furniture are also typically made with PFAS chemicals, so opting out of those products may also be a good idea.\n\nFor longer-term solutions addressing stores of PFAS substances in soil and water, Lee, the Purdue professor, said she focuses on advocating for their removal from manufacturing altogether.\n\n“I think we should ban them from packaging and there is a move in that direction,\" Lee said. \"Because these chem clearly do not break down in the environment … we need to phase these out of our products.\"\n\nContact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-419-1912 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

The other sites are spread out throughout the state, in both rural areas and cities.\n\nThese facilities join roughly 2,400 others nationwide suspected of discharging these chemicals, according to the report from the Environmental Working Group, a research and environmental advocacy organization. Data from the report was compiled using multiple sources from the Environmental Protection Agency and one source from the state of New York.\n\nAs PFAS chemicals are an emerging contaminant, not much yet is known about the toxins, which are commonly used in products ranging from food packaging to paper to stain-resistant fabrics.\n\n'Forever chemicals' were found in Indy's tap water. Why that matters.\n\nThe chemicals are known to build up for years in the environment and have been associated with a range of health problems, including complications to the immune system and hormonal issues.\n\nHundreds of PFAS compounds are still used in manufacturing processes, meaning industrial sites could be discharging them through the water, air or waste. But as reporting for these compounds isn't currently required under federal law, it's hard to say exactly where — or how much — these toxins are being released.\n\nPFAS chemicals spread easily, said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the working group, meaning people living near these industrial sites aren't the only ones affected by their discharges.\n\n\"One of the features of PFAS chemicals is that they are incredibly mobile. It's one of the reasons why we find PFAS not just in the blood of every American, but in the blood of polar bears and penguins,\" Faber said. \"We need to end releases, or at least begin to restrict releases, of PFAS into the air and water.\"\n\nMonitoring PFAS\n\nThe thousands of PFAS compounds, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, take years to break down and build up both in the environment and the body — which is what earns them the nickname \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nEven so, there are no current caps on PFAS discharge under the Clean Air Act or the Clean Water Act, Faber said.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency recently added 172 PFAS chemicals to the Toxic Release Inventory, a list of chemicals that companies are required to report when they discharge them. But this reporting requirement won't take effect until July 2021, and it leaves out hundreds of other PFAS chemicals also used in manufacturing, Faber said.\n\nAlmost all of the 2,500 industrial sites identified in the Environmental Working Group's report are already reporting other chemical discharges required by the Toxic Release Inventory, Faber said, meaning adding PFAS compounds to the list would likely be a relatively simple change for the companies.\n\n\"I think that we're hopeful that this administration or the next administration will simply require all of the PFAS that are actively being used to be reported,\" Faber said. \"Ideally, Congress or EPA would simply require this reporting. But until that happens, this is the best we’re going to have.”\n\nIn Indiana, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management has established screening levels for three specific PFAS compounds, under which the agency deems their concentration to be okay for human health, a spokesperson for the agency said in an email.\n\nAnd while the Environmental Protection Agency has established groundwater standards for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most well-known PFAS compounds, the state environmental management department said sampling and analysis for the chemicals in other parts of the environment such as in the air or soil are still in development.\n\nLinda Lee, an agronomy professor at Purdue University with years of research on PFAS, said although it's possible industrial sites are emitting PFAS chemicals, it's more likely a person will get exposed to the toxin through products in their own homes.\n\n\"As a person in Indiana, I would be foolish to think I’m not exposed to PFAS,\" Lee said. \"But I also don't think that we’re likely getting a lot of direct exposure from these industries, it's probably more from the products we buy from these industries.”\n\nHowever, Lee said she would like to see industries pre-treating their waste before discharging it, as well as a reduction in PFAS chemicals used in manufacturing entirely.\n\n“The fact that we do see these in our water supplies and they've been seen in some of the water supplies in Indianapolis suggest that they’re coming from somewhere other than just everyday things,\" Lee said. \"I just think we don't need to fight about whether they’re toxic or not — they last forever, let's just get rid of them.”\n\nPFAS in Indiana's drinking water, military sites\n\nThe most recent report on industrial sites follows two others from the EWG this year also revealing PFAS presence in Indiana.\n\nThe first found the chemicals in Indianapolis' tap water at levels of 15 parts per trillion. This level is much lower than the EPA's established standard, which is 70 parts per trillion, but higher than standards set by researchers and other state governments — a recent Harvard study, for example, asserts these limits should lie closer to one part per trillion.\n\nThese common landscaping plants are now illegal to sell in Indiana. Here's why.\n\nAnother EWG study released last month highlighted 12 military sites in the state, of more than 600 others nationwide, that have known or suspected PFAS contamination.\n\nPart of the contamination on military sites has been attributed to firefighting foam, made with PFAS chemicals in order to fight difficult fires caused by flammable liquids such as fuels.\n\nHouse Bill 1189 limiting the use of this firefighting foam passed out of the Indiana legislature this year. Under this bill, authored by Rep. Peggy Mayfield, the foam can still be used to fight fires, but is restricted during training and testing.\n\nPFAS chemicals in part are dangerous because of their ubiquity — hundreds of compounds are used to product sandwich wrappers, food containers, makeup and more products in a variety of industries. Not only are the toxins within products, but they have also leached into the water, air and soil.\n\nAs such, Faber said, avoiding contact with the chemical is next to impossible, and eradicating PFAS from the environment would require addressing multiple systems ranging from manufacturing to waste disposal.\n\n“Unfortunately,\" Faber said, \"there’s no silver bullet when it comes to PFAS.\"\n\nContact IndyStar reporter London Gibson at 317-419-1912 or lbgibson@gannett.com.

They've been used and manufactured in the U.S. since the 1940s.\n\nThe chemicals are persistent, remaining both in the environment and the human body and not breaking down over time, EPA information shows, hence their nickname of \"forever\" chemicals. It has been shown that PFAS can cause cancer and other adverse effects if they collect in the human body.\n\nThe chemicals are used for their water- and stain-resistant qualities, in products like clothing and carpet, nonstick cookware, packaging and firefighting foam, according to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.\n\nWhere are they found?\n\nHumans can come into contact with PFAS in many different ways in their everyday life, according to the EPA. Some of the most common sources of the chemicals are from food.\n\nIf food is grown in soil containing PFAS, or water containing PFAS is used to raise a crop, it is absorbed by the plant and then consumed by humans. PFAS are also common in many different forms of food wrapping, especially fast-food wrappers. The chemicals can also be found in animals that have consumed water or food containing PFAS.\n\nThe chemicals are also used in commercial household products, such as polishes, waxes, paints and more.\n\nPFAS are also largely found in drinking water supplies, typically in areas near manufacturing plants that use the chemicals in production, landfills, wastewater treatment plants and firefighter training facilities, according to the EPA. An indication that PFAS are present in a water system is often the presence of foam on top of the water.\n\nRELATED:Pollution cases involving 'forever' chemicals are growing across Wisconsin\n\nWhy are they such a big problem?\n\nMost people in the U.S. have been exposed to PFAS in their lifetime, according to the EPA. Because they accumulate in the human body over long periods of time, there really is no way to get rid of them. Studies have also shown that the chemicals have been linked to reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney and immunological effects in laboratory animals, and have caused tumors and increased cholesterol levels.\n\nLimited findings show that PFAS are also related to low infant birth weights, effects on the immune system, cancer and thyroid hormone disruption, according to the EPA.\n\nIt is also very hard to remove the chemicals from the environment, according to the Interstate Technology and Regulatory Council.\n\nWhat's being done about them?\n\nPFAS are no longer manufactured in the U.S., according to the EPA, but they are still produced internationally and imported to the U.S. in products like leather, textiles, apparel, paper and packaging, rubber and plastics.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the DNR is keeping a close eye on areas known to have high levels of PFAS in the water and soil, and making sure that companies are doing remediation and providing drinking water to residents if needed, like in Marinette and Peshtigo.\n\nRELATED:Johnson Controls provides drinking water to more homes with wells impacted by 'forever' chemicals\n\nThe DNR has also recommended a standard of 20 parts per trillion, which is the highest level of the chemicals allowed in any well, before a company must provide drinking water to residents. The DNR's standard is more stringent than the EPA, which advises a limit standard of 70 parts per trillion.\n\nThere has been some legislation regarding the chemicals, too. In February, Gov. Tony Evers signed into law a bill that prohibits the use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS, unless used in emergency firefighting or fire prevention operations, or if the facility testing the foam has the right kind of containment system and disposal measures.\n\nFurther legislation regarding the chemicals has stalled, though.\n\nRELATED:Bipartisan legislation would trigger quick action on PFAS contamination. Tony Evers promised to sign the bills. So why are they dead?\n\nAre there problem areas in Wisconsin?\n\nThere are several areas across Wisconsin struggling with PFAS, including Madison, Milwaukee and La Crosse, according to the DNR. But the worst contamination has been found in Marinette County, in the area around the Tyco Fire Products testing facility, which was used to test firefighting foam for years, before the practice was ended in 2017.\n\nThe contamination in Marinette requires remediation and that drinking water be delivered to several homeowners who can no longer safely consume the water from their wells. In August, Johnson Controls, Tyco's parent company, said it was setting aside $140 million in its fiscal third quarter on the cleanup.\n\nIn 2019, Johnson Controls argued with the DNR over whether it should be solely responsible for the assessment of the extent of the chemicals when the state agency has agreed that there are other potential sources of pollution. The Glendale-based company was supposed to have reported to the DNR by Sept. 3 but failed to do so.\n\nThat dispute followed another in which the DNR referred Johnson Controls to the state Department of Justice, alleging it waited four years to report the release of hazardous chemicals at its plant in Marinette. That release resulted in some residents unknowingly drinking water for years that was contaminated.\n\nThe Department of Health Services told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in April that an assessment process has begun in the area, too, for a cancer cluster study. A team is working on analyzing data, according to a communications staff member.\n\nAre there alternatives to PFAS?\n\nIn everyday life, there are a lot of situations where having a water-repellent coat or a nonstick pan improve the quality of life.\n\nSo if PFAS are no longer allowed in the U.S., how do companies still produce those products?\n\nAccording to the EPA, a product called GenX is now used to make high-performance nonstick coatings, without the use of harmful PFAS. But the solution is not exactly 100% safe either. GenX chemicals have also been found in surface water, groundwater, drinking water, rainwater and air emissions in some areas.\n\nHave more questions about PFAS?

A guide to understanding chemicals behind ...", "text": "PFAS is an acronym for a family of chemicals called per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances that are celebrated for their use in nonstick cookware and water resistant clothing but also feared for their potential toxicity, which has been linked to types of cancer and other harmful effects.\n\nThese chemicals are synthetic and do not appear naturally in the environment. They were originally discovered in 1938, when a chemist working on refrigerants accidentally created a slippery, white substance that would later lead to the creation of the Teflon brand of nonstick pots and pans.\n\nAs of February 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency counted about 12,000 different kinds of PFAS. The common characteristic of all PFAS is that they include a carbon-fluorine molecule bond, one of the strongest known in chemistry. Other molecules cannot break between the carbon-fluorine bond, and instead slide off of surfaces treated with PFAS.\n\nThat same characteristic can also make PFAS harmful, as the chemicals are virtually indestructible and do not fully degrade in the environment or within living tissue. For that reason, they're often referred to as “forever chemicals.”\n\nRED F:Is EPA putting interests of chemical companies ahead of your health? These experts think so\n\nWhich products contain PFAS?\n\nPFAS chemicals are perhaps best-known for their use in nonstick cookware. The Teflon brand revolutionized such products, but the use of PFAS is widespread across many nonstick cookware brands.\n\nPFAS are also often behind any product that boasts waterproof or stain-resistant properties. Such products include clothing, rainwear, furniture, outdoor equipment, tapes, and cosmetics. They are also frequently used in food packaging to minimize the leaking of grease.\n\nPFAS are also frequently used in electronics, medical equipment, and renewable technologies. The military has used them in foams to help douse fires, particularly those that involve oil and can be water-resistant.\n\nWhat are PFOA and PFOS?\n\nPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are perhaps the two most studied PFAS chemicals. PFOA was a product primarily used by DuPont in its product lines, while PFOS was primarily used by 3M.\n\nDue to concerns about their persistence in the environment and potential for toxicity, DuPont, 3M, and other manufacturers reached an agreement with the EPA in 2006 to phase out PFOA and PFOS in the U.S.\n\nThat resulted in the increased use of a new generation of PFAS, still used today in many common products. Concerns have also arisen over their safety, most notably the “GenX” PFAS chemical, which led to significant contamination in North Carolina.\n\nWhat do PFAS do to your body?\n\nResearch is ongoing about how PFAS move through the environment, how Americans are exposed, and what the chemicals may do to our health.\n\nHealth experts become particularly concerned with any persistent chemical that also displays two other characteristics: those that are bioaccumulative, meaning they build up in living tissue, and those that are toxic, which means they harm living organisms, like plants, animals, and humans.\n\nThe degree to which PFAS are bioaccumulative or toxic changes based on both the specific PFAS chemical considered, and the opinion of researchers.\n\nIt is increasingly well established that PFOA and PFOS in particular are likely both bioaccumulative and toxic. Federal testing shows that they are in the blood of more than 98% of Americans and stay in the body years after exposure.\n\nLarge and numerous studies of highly exposed populations have linked them to health effects including ulcerative colitis, diagnosed high cholesterol, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.\n\nResearchers are also concerned about exposure to PFOA and PFOS among the general U.S. population, with some studies showing that even typical blood levels could be measurably driving up rates of kidney cancer, weakening immune systems and possibly causing tens of thousands of low-birthweight babies each year.\n\nThe threat posed by the 12,000 types of PFAS as a class of chemicals is a point of contention. Advocates of the chemical industry often argue that each PFAS chemical should be judged separately, and that newer PFAS chemicals are less likely to be harmful due to their chemical structures.\n\nBut advocates for stricter regulation say studies suggest many have shared characteristics and risks. They say testing each PFAS chemical individually is not feasible because of how many exist, and that instead the chemicals should be regulated as a class as a precaution.\n\nWhat’s the solution to PFAS?\n\nBecause the commercial and technological benefits of PFAS are substantial, it would be difficult stop their use. The chemicals also are already widely spread in the environment, even in remote areas such as the Arctic.\n\nIn the U.S., the EPA has laid out plans to learn where PFAS are, how to clean them up, how toxic they are, and which regulations need to be implemented to protect the public.\n\nBut many environmental groups and scientists say that more should be done, up to a complete phaseout of PFAS, except for absolutely essential uses.\n\nA commonly held view among environmental groups is that PFAS should at least be regulated as a single class in drinking water and the environment, to simplify the process of evaluating toxicity and deciding when to filter water.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/10/26/delaware-pfas-lawsuit-3m-company-tyco-products-forever-chemicals/71332193007/", "title": "Delaware sues 3M Co., 12 other 'forever chemical' manufacturers", "text": "The Delaware Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against 13 chemical companies, claiming they contaminated Delaware's natural resources and jeopardized public health with \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nDelaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings announced the lawsuit Thursday afternoon.

The chemicals have been linked to several illnesses ranging from infertility to different types of cancers.\n\nA national study from the U.S. Geologic Survey showed that nearly half of the tap water supply across the United States is estimated to have at least one type of PFAS, with individuals in urban centers facing the most risk.\n\nFor years, PFAS have been considered an \"emerging contaminant\" by federal environmental and public health agencies. This year, the federal EPA proposed limiting allowed amounts of PFAS to the lowest level that tests can detect.\n\nIn May, Delaware joined 16 other state attorneys general in the filing of joint comments supporting the EPA's proposed limits. A final rule is expected by the end of this year after a public comment period.\n\nJennings emphasized the importance of water testing as the investigation into the extent of the defendants' damages is still underway, especially for individuals who get their water from private wells.\n\nWater tests are available from the state for $4, and other tests are available through private companies. Residents who receive their water from a community water system should still monitor through the Delaware Drinking Water Watch.\n\nA national trend\n\nAs of August, 26 states have either filed or settled a lawsuit related to PFAS contamination, with 3M Co. facing the most allegations.\n\nIn 2021, Delaware settled a lawsuit against DuPont and its spinoff companies Chemours and Corteva, resulting in at least $50 million in damages paid to Delaware. A contingency of the settlement stated that if the companies settle similar claims with other states for more than $50 million before July 2029, they are to pay Delaware an additional $25 million.\n\nPrevious Reporting:3M, DuPont, Chemours reach settlements of lawsuits involving harmful 'forever chemicals'\n\nOver the summer, 3M agreed to pay over $10 billion over 13 years to public water systems across the country to test and clean up potential water pollution. DuPont, Chemours and Corteva reached a similar $1.19 billion deal to resolve claims that they polluted public drinking water systems.\n\nOver $11 billion in damages have already been paid by 3M, DuPont, Chemours and Corteva combined. There are still over 15,000 claims that have been filed nationwide against these four companies.\n\nRead the full lawsuit below:\n\nContact Molly McVety at mmcvety@delawareonline.com.

The lawsuit was filed by Napoli Shkolnik, a national law firm specializing in environmental litigation.\n\nThe suit stems from the contamination of groundwater by PFAS in the city's water system. According to the release, the city detected PFAS in six of its groundwater wells \"as a direct and proximate result of the use of these chemicals by Defendants and other manufacturing companies in the area.\"\n\nThe suit targets companies that manufactured the chemicals – which are used in various industrial and consumer products – for decades without informing customers of the risks.

The city is working to install a granulated carbon filtration system, which is the best way to extract PFAS from water.\n\nThe city council recently approved borrowing $17.5 million to finance a treatment system that will be installed over the next year.

Some manufacturers have started to draw up settlements in those lawsuits, including 3M, which earlier this summer put forward a $10.3 billion proposal that would be paid out over 13 years to impacted communities.\n\nThe state of Wisconsin has also taken action against the company Tyco.

And why do they last so long?\n\nHere's what you need to know about the chemicals, and what Wisconsin is doing about them.\n\nWhat are PFAS?\n\nPFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a group of chemicals that have been used and manufactured in the U.S. since the 1940s.\n\nThe chemicals are used for their water- and stain-resistant qualities, in products like clothing and carpet, nonstick cookware, packaging and firefighting foams.\n\nHumans can come into contact with PFAS in many different ways in their everyday life. Some of the most common sources of the chemicals are from food\n\nWhy are people so worried?\n\nMost people in the U.S. have been exposed to PFAS in their lifetime. Because the compounds accumulate in the human body over long periods of time, there is no way to get rid of them. Studies have also shown that the chemicals have been linked to reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney and immunological effects in laboratory animals, and have caused tumors and increased cholesterol levels.\n\nLimited findings show that PFAS are also related to low infant birth weights, effects on the immune system, cancer and thyroid hormone disruption.\n\nIt is also very hard to remove the chemicals from the environment, and once they are released they travel through water very easily.\n\nWhere are they in Wisconsin?\n\nSeveral areas across Wisconsin are dealing with PFAS, including Madison, Milwaukee, Eau Claire and Wausau. But the worst contamination has been found in Marinette County, in the area around the Tyco Fire Products testing facility, which was used to test firefighting foam for years before the practice was ended in 2017.\n\nThe contamination in Marinette requires remediation and delivery of drinking water to several homeowners who can no longer safely consume the water from their wells. In 2019, Johnson Controls, Tyco's parent company, said it was setting aside $140 million in its fiscal third quarter on the cleanup.\n\nMore:Drinking water in all of Wausau's municipal wells test above the recommended state standards for PFAS known as 'forever chemicals'\n\nFrench Island, near the city of La Crosse, is also facing widespread contamination. The PFAS on the island are believed to have come from the La Crosse Regional Airport, which used firefighting foam to extinguish crashes on its grounds over the years, as well as annual foam testing. The state Department of Natural Resources is testing private wells on the island and providing bottled water to more than 1,000 people with contaminated wells.\n\nThe chemicals have also been detected in wildlife across the state. In Peshtigo, the DNR issued an advisory for fish in some ponds in the area, as well as deer liver after testing showed elevated levels of PFAS in both.\n\nThe DNR has also issued advisories for brook and brown trout in Silver Creek in Monroe County, rainbow smelt in Lake Superior and a number of fish in lakes Monona, Upper Mud, Waubesa and Kegonsa, as well as in sections of the Yahara River in Madison.\n\nMore:Here's what you should know about Milorganite and a recent study showing it may contain 'forever chemicals'.\n\nHow are the chemicals detected?\n\nPFAS are detected through lab tests. Typically, the DNR or local municipality can collect small water samples from bodies of water or wells, and then send them away to a lab for analysis. This process can take up to several months to deliver results.\n\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee are also working on technology that would help agencies get a better idea of the amount of PFAS in bodies of water. The small, inexpensive technology would be able to be placed in water for longer periods of time to collect PFAS and then be analyzed in a lab for a better idea of how many of the chemicals are passing through the water every day.\n\nWhat is Wisconsin doing about them?\n\nThe DNR is keeping a close eye on areas known to have high levels of PFAS in the water and soil, and making sure that companies are doing remediation and providing drinking water to residents if needed, like in Marinette, Peshtigo and La Crosse.\n\nThe DNR and state Department of Health Services have also recommended a standard of 20 parts per trillion, which is the highest level of the chemicals allowed in a well before a company must provide drinking water to residents. The state's recommended standard is more stringent than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's recommendation of a limit standard of 70 parts per trillion.\n\nLast year, Gov. Tony Evers also proposed several measures as a part of his biennial budget for the detection and remediation of PFAS. However, the Republican-controlled Legislature removed most of those measures.\n\nOne of the reasons for pushback is the fact that PFAS are still an emerging contaminant, unregulated by the federal government and lacking numerous studies across the thousands of chemicals in the family.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in April announced the re-introduction of a bill that failed to advance in the past. The CLEAR Act would include a municipal grant program to help hard-hit communities, as well as county well-testing programs, funds to collect and dispose of PFAS-containing firefighting foam, money for the testing of public water supplies, standards for the chemicals in the ground, surface and drinking water, and money for communities to conduct mitigation efforts.\n\nThe bill would allow for several of the proposed measures in Evers' budget to move forward outside the budgeting process. It has not yet been taken up by the Legislature.\n\nAre there regulations for PFAS?\n\nThere has been some legislation regarding the chemicals in Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2020, Evers signed into law a bill that prohibits the use of firefighting foam that contains PFAS, unless used in emergency firefighting or fire prevention operations, or if the facility testing the foam has an adequate containment system and disposal measures. Key measures of that bill were stripped away by the Legislature, though, including PFAS levels at which a company would be required to stop the release of wastewater.\n\nOther legislation has stalled.\n\nMeanwhile, standards for PFOA and PFOS, two of the most well-known PFAS are poised to reach the Legislature this spring. The regulations would set standards for the compounds in surface, ground and drinking water across the state, largely at 20 parts per trillion.\n\nThe Biden Administration, however, has acknowledged the need to regulate PFAS and has set an aggressive course of action, called the PFAS Roadmap.\n\nWho's opposed to PFAS regulations?\n\nWisconsin's largest business lobbying group, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, has filed several lawsuits against the DNR for its PFAS testing programs for industrial sites. The group has called the DNR's initiatives to find PFAS in state waters a \"fishing expedition,\" and said that to continue, the agency will need the Legislature to pass laws allowing them to set standards and continue testing.\n\nThe group has also sued over remediation standards for sites with known PFAS contaminations, saying that the recommended standards for remediation put too much of a burden on businesses.\n\nIn one of those cases, a Jefferson County judge ruled that the DNR can sample the water leaving businesses for PFAS, but until standards are passed in the state, the agency can't take action against the business.\n\nAre there alternatives to PFAS?\n\nIn everyday life, having a water-repellent coat or a nonstick pan can improve the quality of life.\n\nSo if PFAS are no longer allowed in the U.S., how do companies still produce those products?\n\nAccording to the EPA, a product called GenX is now used to make high-performance nonstick coatings, without the use of harmful PFAS. But the solution is not exactly 100% safe either. GenX chemicals have also been found in surface water, groundwater, drinking water, rainwater and air emissions in some areas.\n\nWhat we've reported\n\nTyco Fire Products, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, knew it was polluting groundwater at least four years before the company began providing bottled water to residents and was ordered by state officials to investigate the extent of the contamination.\n\nHow bipartisan legislation that would have provided for quick action on PFAS contamination wound up on the cutting room floor.\n\nTests on a drainage ditch near the Tyco Fire Products facility showed levels of PFAS nearly 50 times higher than state recommended levels.\n\nAfter pushback from groups including Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the Board of Natural Resources decided against setting rules for PFAS.\n\nTyco Fire Products, a subsidiary of Johnson Controls, will pay $17.5 million to 271 Peshtigo households with PFAS contamination in private drinking wells.\n\nFrench Island was a perfect community with picturesque views until residents found out about the chemicals leaching into their private drinking wells.\n\nHow to reach public officials involved\n\nFind out who your state legislators are and how to contact them at legis.wisconsin.gov.\n\nTo contact Gov.

They came to Carver-Hawkeye Arena to watch the best Iowa wrestling team in a decade close out the 2019-20 regular season in style.\n\nThe top-ranked Hawkeyes trounced eighth-ranked Oklahoma State, 34-6, here on Sunday night, marking their largest win over the Cowboys since 1995 (31-3). As such, Iowa caps the regular season with a perfect 13-0 dual record while Oklahoma State finishes 13-3.\n\n“We’re pleased,” Iowa coach Tom Brands said. “Go Hawks.”\n\nIowa blew through the Cowboys in much the same way it blew through the rest of the regular season, with a relentless combination of firepower and tenacity, a lethal cocktail that led the Hawkeyes to seven wins over top-10 teams and two more over teams inside the top-20. They left little doubt that they are the team to beat in Division I wrestling this season.\n\nAgainst an Oklahoma State squad that hopes to contend for a trophy at next month’s NCAA Championships, Iowa won eight of 10 matches and scored bonus in six — four major decisions and a pair of pins. They scored more than twice as many total match points, 79-33, and more than three times as many total takedowns, 22-6.\n\nThe eruption began early, as Iowa stormed to a 20-0 lead. Spencer Lee, the nation’s top-ranked 125-pounder, bolstered his case for the Hodge Trophy with a 12-3 major decision over fourth-ranked Nick Piccininni. He led 6-0 early on a takedown and four back points, then added a two-point nearfall, a point for stalling and riding time along the way.\n\n“I have to keep scoring points,” said Lee, who’s now 15-0 this year and has scored bonus in 14 of them. “I have bigger goals than just this match. It was a good win. I’m feeling good about it.\n\n“It’s bonus points, bonus points, bonus points, and then again, bonus points. We have to keep scoring points.”\n\nMore bonus points came — and they came in a hurry.\n\nAustin DeSanto followed with a pin over Reece Witcraft at 133, readjusting on the edge for a fall in two minutes, 38 seconds. Max Murin then scored five takedowns in a 15-4 major over Dusty Hone at 141. Pat Lugo followed with a pin over third-ranked Boo Lewallen at 149, using double-underhooks to bring Lewallen to the ground then running him over for the fall in 2:22.\n\n“I felt it and I went for it and got the six points,” said Lugo, who entered ranked fourth nationally by Trackwrestling. “The only thing better would’ve been if I had done it in Stillwater, in front of all of them.\n\n“It was a good night, but the job’s not finished. We’ve got Big Tens and nationals, you know? I want to do the same thing and get my hand raised on that stage.”\n\nThat result brought the crowd to fever pitch heard all too often this season.\n\nThe Hawkeyes had 10,000-plus fans at all seven home duals this season, totaling 87,979 fans for an average of 12,568 per home dual, all new NCAA single-season records. In its seven duals, Iowa went a combined 56-14 in individual matches and scored bonus in 22. For all 13: 108-22, with 45 bonus-point wins.\n\n“Great schedule, and (the fans) showed up,” Brands said. “They showed up from the get-go. There was 10,000-plus for Chattanooga.”\n\nOklahoma State took two of the next four — Wyatt Sheets scored two third-period takedowns in a 9-4 win over Kaleb Young at 157 to put the Cowboys on the board, then Anthony Montalvo beat an undersized Nelson Brands, 8-2, at 184 — but the Hawkeyes countered with a pair of major decisions down the stretch, from Michael Kemerer (174) and Tony Cassioppi (285).\n\nEvery single fan stood for each performance. They have waited a decade for an Iowa team this good. They have longed to see the black and gold finish on top again. Eight of the last nine years have ended with a blue-and-white-colored March, a run of success that has driven these Hawkeyes.\n\nThis year’s team seems poised to reach the top again. The lineup is a fusion of elite talent, both seasoned and youthful — Brands said true freshmen Abe Assad, who has missed the last three duals, didn’t go Sunday for precautionary reasons, and that he will return for the Big Ten Championships in Piscataway, New Jersey, in two weeks.\n\nThose all-important three days in March will come just two weeks after. An undefeated record, a Big Ten regular season title, another Midlands team crown and wins over rivals are nice, but the postseason will reveal how this story ends. Just minutes after Sunday night’s dual ended, Brands’ attention had already shifted.\n\n“We have to get ready to give our fans something to be excited about going into this postseason,” Brands said. “Time to tune these guys in. Put a razor’s edge on them.\n\n“Let’s put some exclamation marks on these next two tournaments.”\n\nCody Goodwin covers wrestling and high school sports for the Des Moines Register.

The Crimson Tide was also named the nation’s No. 1 team in the USA Today’s Amway Coaches Poll released Aug. 3.\n\nAlabama, which lost 35-31 to Clemson in last season’s national championship game to finish the year at No. 2 in the AP poll, received 52 of the possible 61 first-place votes. Ohio State was ranked No. 2 with Florida State, which received four first-place votes, third.\n\nMore:Saban, Alabama motivated by Clemson loss, refuse to ‘waste a failure’\n\nFSU’s No. 3 ranking solidifies the season opener between No. 1 Alabama and the third-ranked Seminoles (7 p.m., Sept. 2 in Atlanta) as the first Top-3 matchup to take place on the opening weekend of the season.\n\nIn college football's modern era (since 1950), the highest-ranked season openers are a pair of 1-vs.-4 matchups — No. 1 Oklahoma vs. No. 4 UCLA in 1986, and No. 1 Nebraska vs. No. 4 Penn State in 1983.\n\n“I think it's a great opportunity. I think it's what college football is about,” FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said at the ACC Kickoff last month in Charlotte, North Carolina. “You get to walk in that atmosphere and environment, the two-winningest teams in college football in the last seven years. I think it's great for our league, I think it's great for college football.”\n\nThis is the second straight year and fourth time in the last eight years that Alabama will open the season with the AP’s No. 1 ranking, which isn’t necessarily a positive sign.\n\nNot since Southern California in 2004 has the top team in the AP’s initial preseason poll finished in the same spot. In fact, the previous three times the Crimson Tide opened the year at No. 1, it finished 10th in 2010, seventh in 2013 and second last season.\n\n“We're not going to be in the mood to be making comparisons or making comments on rankings,” Saban said last week. “It's flattering that people think highly of our team, but our team needs to understand that they need to prove who they are to by what they do, and this means very, very little.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/lsu/2019/10/27/lsu-football-top-ranked-associated-press/2479482001/", "title": "LSU football ranked No. 1 in Associated Press poll", "text": "RALPH D.

And UCF fans already claiming the 2022 Heisman for John Rhys Plumlee.\n\nWe'll try to quickly sober up and treat this with clearing eyes.\n\nT1. Florida, 1-0. Kentucky at home Saturday. From 1987 to 2017, this was automatic for the Gators, but the past four meetings have produced a 2-2 split. Lots of hype in Hogtown after that dramatic win over the Utes. Too much hype, maybe — ’Cats 26, Gators 20.\n\nT1. Miami (1-0). Southern Miss at home Saturday. The Hurricanes brought us the turnover chain and created a cottage industry. New coach Mario Cristobal has taken it away, and let’s hope all the others follow that trend, too, and not just because Oregon State now has the Turnover Chainsaw — U 42, Golden Eagles 13.\n\n3. UCF (1-0). Louisville at home Friday. Louisville is one of those programs that’s pretty good for a while, briefly very good, then it’s “hey, what happened to Louisville?” After a lopsided loss to Syracuse last week, we know where things stand — Knights 40, Cardinals 19.\n\n4. FSU (2-0). Off this week. The Seminoles are 2-0 for the first time since 2016. Lots of excitement after that win over LSU, but man, the clumsy play call (and fumble) that nearly cost them . . .\n\n5. FAU, (1-1). Southeast Louisiana at home Saturday. Former UM quarterback N’Kosi Perry is off to a great start in Del Boca Vista. Nothing to indicate he’ll slow down this week — Owls 32, Lions 10.\n\n6. USF (0-1). Howard at home Saturday. Baylor transfer Gerry Bohannon is the sixth different QB to start for Bulls’ head coach Jeff Scott. The Scott Era is just 23 games deep, by the way. Bohannon might not stick, but it won’t be due to anything that happens this week — Bulls 33, Bison13.\n\n7. FIU (1-0). At Texas State Saturday. It took a while, but the Panthers finally learned how to properly schedule season openers. Last week they opened with Bryant, and you can’t tell me you didn’t have to Google that one. The previous two openers brought Jacksonville State and Long Island U. Next year: Father Lopez — Bobcats 26, Panthers 14.\n\nSunday School: Has Tom Brady met the irresistible force?\n\nYou don’t need to channel Jimmy The Greek to properly rank Florida’s three NFL franchises.\n\nSure, it could change over the coming weeks, but for now . . .\n\n1. Tampa Bay. At Dallas Sunday night. Lots of talk about Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen having opposing views about his continued stiff-arming of Father Time. Safety blitzes are peach custard compared to marital discord, so let’s hope all’s well with these kids. Meanwhile, however — Cowboys 27, Bucs 24.\n\n2. Miami. New England at home Sunday. It’s rarely this crystal clear, but fact is, the first few weeks of the 2022 season will tell the tale on Tua Time. Might as well buy the optimism for now, but all the same, sneak a now-and-then glance at the QB draft class of 2023 to see how things are going — Dolphins 20, Pats 19.\n\n3. Jacksonville. At Washington Sunday. Jags fans are forgiven for looking at new Washington QB Carson Wentz and shuddering at the thought. Wentz wasn’t viewed at quite the can’t-miss level as Trevor Lawrence, but pretty damn close. Now, he’s in resurrection mode.

Hideaway also was ranked No. 10 for staff friendliness and No. 16 in course conditions in the U.S.\n\n\"We've been getting more and more golfers calling to get tee times,\" Hideaway director of golf Sean Balliet said. \"There's a lot of pride our members have taken. They've sent messages to friends across the country.\"\n\nHideaway led a contingent of five Lee County courses ranked in the top 25 in the state by Golf Advisor.\n\nThe others are Old Orange at Verandah Golf Club (No. 3), Old Corkscrew Golf Club (No. 7), Colonial Country Club (No. 11) and Whispering Oak at Verandah Golf Club (No. 21).\n\n\"We play 42,000 rounds, which is up 20 percent from the year before,\" said Mark Iwinski, general manager of Old Corkscrew. \"I do attribute some of that to Golf Advisor. Things can go viral overnight.\"\n\nBrandon Tucker, managing editor of Golf Advisor, which is affiliated with the Golf Channel, said he noticed Fort Myers and Southwest Florida courses showing up in reviews.\n\n\"Those operators have found the right price point and opportunity,\" he said. \"Their courses are not too jampacked. They've stumbled upon a pretty good mix because golfers are happy.\"\n\nHideaway isn't new (built in 1984), isn't long (5,146 yards) and only has openings for non-members six months out of the year.\n\nHowever, Hideaway's charms, customer service and overall conditions more than made up for that.\n\nTucker golfed here a few years ago but admits he never heard of Hideaway until the reviews poured in.\n\n\"I'm blown away by (golfers') experiences,\" he said. \"Service is off the charts. They rave about the conditions. Good greens and a friendly layout.\n\n\"I do partially hope that this serves notice to the community you don't need 8,000 yards on so many acres. Keep it affordable so more kids and beginners can get into the game.\"\n\nHideaway scored highest in-state in four of the five subcategories: conditions, value, pace of play, and food & beverage.\n\n•Conditions: After a battle, Joe Thompson, membership chairman of our greens committee, Balliet and golf course superintendent Jeff Burgoyne got members to agree on paspalum platinum. It was used in the PGA Championship in Kiawah Island, S.C. and is used on some local courses.\n\n\"We had a lot of discussion,\" Thompson said. \"It's beautiful. Golfers marvel about the feel. It's like playing on a green carpet. I think it's the grass of the future and it's good here because it reacts well to salt water.\"\n\nPlanting the new grass was part of a $1.4 million renovation three years ago, Balliet said. Bunkers were redone and G-angle sand went into the bunkers. Among the 18 holes, 217 trees and more than 6,000 native plants were laid down. Those plants and trees now have matured.\n\n\"I don't think I've played on a course with better fairways and greens for the price,\" JJarrett1955 wrote in his survey. \"And that includes courses like Old Corkscrew, Stoneybrook and The Raptor (Bay).\"\n\n•Value: It costs $33 to play Hideaway, which is open from 7 a.m.-3 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. \"It's good fit for our community,\" said Balliet, who doesn't plan on raising costs next summer.\n\n•Pace of play: On Hideaway's scorecard, it's clearly written: Slow play is not tolerated. Please keep pace with the group ahead of you.\n\n\"All it takes is one group to screw the whole thing up,\" Thompson said. \"Sean is good at managing a conflict. He's stern but not ugly.\"\n\nTom Julian, 73, of Cape Coral, said he has played the course as quickly as 2½ hours. On days with no golfers, he has played two competing golf balls and finished in a little over three hours.\n\n\"We'll have a shotgun at 8:30 a.m. and everybody is in before 12:30 p.m. for lunch,\" Thompson said.\n\n•Food and beverage: For an extra five bucks, people can get lunch — selected items off the menu along with a soft drink or draft beer.\n\n\"We've had people call and ask, 'Do you still have that lunch special?'\" Balliet said. \"It seems to be working.\"\n\nJulian has played a number of Lee County courses as well as Doral in Miami, Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina and Colonia in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n\"I think's probably the best (in Lee County) for several reasons,\" he said. \"It's a well-maintained course, the staff is very friendly and nobody ever gets in your way.

Georgia is coming off a bye and looks to widen its one-game lead over Florida and No. 16 Missouri (next week’s opponent) and extend its winning streak to 24. The Bulldogs boast FBS' No. 3 offense (509.4 yards per game) and No. 5 passing game (337.0) along with having the No. 10 defense (91.4 yards allowed). Quarterback Carson Beck, a Jacksonville native, has completed 74% of his passes for 2,152 yards and 12 touchdowns. The Gators have won two straight; Graham Mertz has passed for 12 touchdowns along with 1,872 yards. Ricky Pearsall has 43 receptions for 624 yards and three TDs. Georgia leads the series 55-44-2 and is 5-2 against Florida under coach Kirby Smart.

The Volunteers led No. 9 Alabama 20-7 at halftime before allowing 27 unanswered points in Tuscaloosa and dropping their second SEC game 34-20. Kentucky had a bye after losing a 14-0 first-quarter lead against Missouri and its second consecutive game, 38-21. Rushing attacks will be on display in Lexington with the Vols leading the SEC at 217.29 yards per game. Wildcats running back Ray Davis averages a conference-best 111.6 yards per contest and has scored a SEC-best 78 points.\n\nVanderbilt is 2-18 as Mississippi’s homecoming opponent and enters Saturday night’s meeting in Oxford as a 24.5-point underdog, according to FanDuel.com Sportsbook. The overall series is much closer with the No. 12 Rebels leading 53-40-2, though Ole Miss has won eight of 10 against the Commodores. Vandy seeks its first series win since 2012.\n\nMissouri’s Brady Cook completed his ninth pass over 40 yards this season with a 42-yard TD to Luther Burden against South Carolina. The Tigers completed just seven over 40 yards last season. ... Mississippi State linebacker Nathaniel Watson had two sacks while posting his 14th career double-digit tackle game with 14 stops at Arkansas. His 71 total tackles are second to teammate Jett Johnson in the SEC. ... Alabama’s Will Reichard has made 28 consecutive field goals, including kicks of 42 and 50 yards during a 10-point game against Tennessee.\n\nMissouri’s Cody Schrader has rushed for a league-best 807 yards on 140 carries and ranks second in per-game average at 100.9. He carried 26 times for a Tigers career high of 159 yards with two scores in last week’s 34-12 victory over South Carolina, his fourth 100-yard game this season and eighth in his career. He gained 102 on 13 attempts before halftime, both season highs.

North Oldham took the tiebreaker and No. 1 seed for the district tournament by virtue of point differential in district games.\n\nOldham County, which will host the district tournament starting Feb. 27, needed to beat North Oldham by nine or more points Thursday to take the No. 1 seed.\n\n“We would have liked to get that No. 1 seed,” Leslie said. “It got to the point where it was like, ‘We just have to win now.’”\n\nIt still was a meaningful victory for the Colonels (19-5), who got 14 points from Luis Nava.\n\n“It always means a lot to beat North,” Green said. “I was really proud of our guys the way we battled. We’ve talked a lot that we haven’t got much respect among people in the state. I think we just earned it.”\n\nGrant Neal scored 31 points to lead North Oldham (19-3).\n\nNorth Oldham, ranked sixth in the state in 3-point shooting at 40.4%, finished 7 of 27 from behind the arc Thursday. But Mustangs coach David Levitch said defense was his team’s biggest issue.\n\n“We just have to play better defense,” he said. “We’re not rotating right. When you lose by two … little things matter in these games on defense.”\n\nIt was a roller-coaster game for Green, who entered averaging 32.3 points per game.\n\nHe scored all seven of his team’s points in the first quarter, but the Colonels trailed 19-7. Green didn’t score in the second quarter, but his teammates got rolling and built a 35-28 halftime lead.\n\nGreen found his groove in the third quarter, with his sixth 3-pointer of the period coming at the buzzer and giving the Colonels a 59-48 edge.\n\n“He has a stretch about every game where he does that,” Leslie said. “It’s awesome and maddening at the same time. He has a few of those, ‘No, no, no, great shot!’ He has a lot of rope, and you have to do that when you have a guy who leads the state in scoring. When he’s on a burner, you just sit back and get a drink and say, ‘He’s going to shoot the next one.’ The worst thing you can do is overcoach that.”\n\nGreen said he wasn’t concerned after his scoreless second quarter.\n\n“Everybody was probably like, ‘What’s going on?’” said Green, who has signed with Holy Cross. “But I didn’t worry. I knew it was just a matter of time. I don’t get too high or too low.”\n\nOldham County missed 3 of 4 free throws in the final 12 seconds, allowing North Oldham a final chance to win.

Even with the Nov. 22 measure's failure to pass, it failed by only 30 votes.\n\nThese votes generate a lot of interest, said Ken McDowell, the director for the Sussex County Department of Elections. Out of all the elections, he said, these tax increase votes require the most thought.\n\nThe referendums often have higher voter turnout than school board elections, he added.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"You see a far greater number of people come out for referendum because of the pocketbook issues,\" McDowell said. \"There is great interest in it.\"\n\nWhile Sussex County has the highest success in the state in passing referendums since 2011, school officials understand it's no simple task. They stress a few key components to the success of the recent votes — community support, effective outreach, transparency and already low tax rates.\n\nKent County, too, has had relative success passing referendums.\n\nSince 2011, Kent County has passed six out of the eight referendums related to county schools.\n\nHowever, the support districts receive in Sussex and Kent counties trends a little lower in New Castle County.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River referendum passes by almost 2,000 votes\n\nFor comparison, New Castle County has only passed 10 out of the 17 referendums held since 2011. Most recently, a referendum in the Colonial School District held on Feb. 28 that failed 2,961 to 2,067 on additional taxes that would have generated $10.9 million. A bond question to authorize the district to take out $4.7 million in bonds for school security upgrades that was voted on at the same time as the tax increase also failed by a count of 2,733 to 2,193.\n\nThat's roughly a 59 percent success rate, while Sussex and Kent voted to raise taxes more than 75 percent of the time.\n\nDistricts with lower taxes, such as Indian River, will only go to a referendum if they need to construct a building or raise money for the budget, said Brian Baull, mayor of Dagsboro and a member of the Indian River High School Band Boosters.\n\n\"The district doesn't come to the voters unless there is a serious need,\" he said.\n\nKeeping taxes low\n\nFor Alyssa Titus, public information officer for the Cape Henlopen School District, the difficulties the district faces while campaigning for tax increases are made easier by community support.\n\n\"I know other districts have a tough time, but we have so much support,\" she said.\n\nThe Cape Henlopen School District broke ground on a new H.O. Brittingham Elementary School on March 23, exactly one year to the day a tax increase to fund the school — along with several others — was passed.\n\nThe tax increase was passed by a count of 2,947 to 1,031.\n\nVoters in the Cape Henlopen School District approved the $130.18 million dollar tax increase — with those living in the district responsible for paying for $48.1 million of it — to help rebuild or renovate the district's four elementary schools as well as add a new Sussex Consortium.\n\nThis referendum raised property taxes by 33 cents per $100 of assessed property value.\n\nIn April of 2014, the Cape Henlopen School District passed another referendum to build a new elementary school in Lewes, which raised the property tax rate by 27 cents.\n\nThe tax increase in the Indian River School District approved on March 2 raised taxes by 49 cents per $100 of assessed value, with 33 cents going toward dealing with growth, 8 cents going toward student safety improvements and 8 cents going toward student services, such as textbooks, technology and student clubs and organizations.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River referendum fails in razor-close vote\n\nThe property tax rate in the Indian River School District has increased by 63.7 cents since 2011. Property tax rates increased by 60 cents in the Cape Henlopen School District during that same time period.\n\nDespite seeing a combined $1.237 worth of tax increases, the Cape Henlopen and Indian River school districts still have the two lowest tax rates in Sussex County, with Indian River being the lowest at $3.068 and Cape Henlopen the second lowest at $3.213.\n\nEven though Sussex County has had recent success in passing such tax increases, Indian River School District Superintendent Mark Steele said the measures, particularly tax increases for current expense funds, are not easy to pass.\n\n\"I think the tendency to pass a major capital referendum may be a little easier than passing a current expense, and I think the reason that is with a major capital, people in the community can see what their tax dollars are going toward,\" he said. \"They can see a new building or an addition, whereas when you have a current expense, it’s operations. So you don’t really see that money.\"\n\nThe approval of the tax increase in the Indian River School District came just weeks before Delaware Gov. John Carney announced there would be a $15 million cut to operation funds and a $22 million cut to the Education Sustainment Fund.\n\nUnder the proposed budget, Carney wants to empower schools to raise the match tax, the tax that funds things such as minor capital improvements, without going to referendum in order to cover reductions to the Sustainment Fund.\n\nHowever, school district officials have said they would be reluctant to use that option\n\nIt takes a community\n\nSteele and Titus both agreed it's community turnout that helps these tax increases pass.\n\nWhen Titus receives pushback from the community about the tax increases, she reminds people the funds raised go toward schools, and better schools raise property values.\n\n\"I think it’s cool that a lot of young families are moving and they care about our public education being great, and they understand what it takes for schools to be great, with new buildings and new teachers and new resources,\" she said. \"I definitely attribute to our community being very, very forward thinking understand in the changing needs of the district.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Tax vote bears fruit with Cape school groundbreaking\n\nSteele said reaching people helped in passing the March 2 tax increase.\n\nFacebook Live sessions in the days and weeks leading up to the vote, Steele said, helped him reach people.\n\nFor Steele, that made all the difference.\n\n\"I think in having a chance to talk to the superintendent from Colonial, I think one of the big things is you need to get to people,\" he said. \"And if you can’t get to people you’re in bad shape, because you will have the group who will not support it no matter how many times you go. So you have to make sure you go out to spread the message.\"\n\nTitus, too, said making administration highly visible during the days leading up to the votes makes a large difference.\n\nShe said on the days leading up to tax increase votes, Cape Henlopen Superintendent Robert Fulton and Cape Henlopen Director of Facilities Operations Brian Bassett are often in the community once a day spreading information about these votes.\n\n\"They are addressing concerns citizens may have, she said. \"That has been extremely helpful in moving a referendum forward.\"\n\nBaull, the Dagsboro mayor, said he feels it is important these tax increases are passed because they are not only important for the students themselves but for teachers, as well.\n\nBACKGROUND: Voters approve Cape schools referendum\n\nApproving the referendum to increase taxes helps to keep teachers in the district for years to come as well as ensure they are fairly compensated, he added.\n\n\"No one wants to hear that their taxes are going up,\" Baull said. \"But a referendum to benefit our students' future is a good thing.\"\n\nOverall, McDowell, the election organizer, gets very excited when he sees a large turnout for a vote, such as the one for the Indian River School District.\n\nFor that vote, 12,489 people voted — the most for any tax increase vote in the history of Sussex County, he said.\n\nMcDowell said these high turnouts are symbolic of democracy in action.\n\n\"Democracy is a great thing,\" McDowell said. \"There are countries in the world who would love to have a say in their government, schools and towns.\"\n\nrghughes@delmarvanow.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2017/02/08/new-cape-henlopen-school-love-creek-taking-shape/97641508/", "title": "New Cape Henlopen school, Love Creek, taking shape", "text": "Gray Hughes\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nAcross the street from Beacon Middle School in Lewes, construction crews are working to give life to the metal and concrete structure across the street.\n\nThat structure is the newest building in the Cape Henlopen School District — Love Creek Elementary School.\n\nA referendum was held in 2014 to approve the construction of the new school.\n\nBrian Bassett, the director of facilities operations and construction for the Cape Henlopen School District, said the school is being built to deal with growth within the district, the population of which has grown by 1,000 students from 2001 to 2015, according to the district.\n\nBecause of those numbers, Bassett wanted to make sure the school was being built to last, and could accommodate needs for students, teachers and staff in the ever-changing platform of education in 2017 and beyond.\n\n\"We really tried to make it a great place for the students, the teachers and all the staff,\" Bassett said. \"We gave them some comforts so they enjoy being here, and if they enjoy being here and they’re happy, we get great work out of them.\"\n\nHe added the school is being built for \"approximately $29 million,\" which includes purchasing the land, the actual construction and furnishing the building.\n\nEach existing elementary school will send 100 to 200 kids, those who live closest to, to make up the new school's population, Bassett said.\n\nHe said Love Creek will relieve a lot of the congestion at the other schools, where some classes are being taught in trailers.\n\nThe school will have a gym and cafeteria in one wing, kindergarten and first grade in another and second through fifth grades together in another section of the school.\n\nIn the middle will be administrative offices.\n\nREAD MORE: Teachers staying in droves in coastal Delaware schools\n\n\"The building will be approximately 90,000 square feet,\" said Dean Johnson, CEO of Richard Y.

Brittingham and Rehoboth Elementary School.\n\nConstruction is set to begin on the new H.O. Brittingham very soon, Bassett said, and meetings are being held to discuss the next steps in constructing a new Rehoboth Elementary School.\n\n\"We will have six new schools in about five years,\" Bassett said.\n\nJohnson, who will also be constructing the other new schools, attributed that to keeping an aggressive schedule.\n\nEven with the aggressive schedule, officials are ensuring student safety concerns are being met. All the doors in each cluster can be locked down, Bassett said, to ensure no one can get in if there is an intruder in the school. He added there will be no blind spots in the school, either, because of the amount of cameras.\n\nThe need for school security, and all the other additional details, for Mumford, goes back to the meetings held to discuss the needs for the school.\n\n\"I think that decision was very bright and very smart,\" she said. \"I am excited for the opportunity to teach in that school.\"\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/24/judge-red-clay-broke-election-rules-tax-vote-funding-system-broken/342442001/", "title": "Judge: Red Clay broke election rules on tax vote; funding system ...", "text": "A Chancery Court judge has ruled that the Red Clay Consolidated School District broke election rules when it successfully passed a voter referendum to raise property taxes last year, but he refused to invalidate the result, citing \"dysfunction\" in the state's school funding system.\n\n\"In this case, without a favorable vote, Red Clay faced a looming deficit. Prevailing in the Special Election was therefore crucial, and the Red Clay administrators were under a great deal of pressure to achieve that result,\" wrote Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster in an opinion issued Wednesday. \"Unfortunately, their understandable desire to obtain adequate funding to fulfill their mission led them to undermine the electoral process.\"\n\nThe Delaware chapter of the American Civil Liberties union sued Red Clay after a referendum in February 2015 on behalf of residents who said they were not able to make it to the polls.\n\nDETAILS:Read more about the lawsuit\n\nBACKGROUND:Why property taxes haven't been reassessed\n\nThe plaintiffs argued Red Clay held \"parent engagement events\" on the day of the vote to encourage turnout among parents who had a vested stake in voting for the increase. They also said that those events crammed parking lots, making it hard for elderly voters to make it into the schools that serve as polling places.\n\nThe lawsuit accused Red Clay of \"one-sided\" get-out-the-vote efforts, going to great lengths to reach out to parents and district supporters but avoiding broader methods of communicating with those who don't have children in the district and might vote against the referendum.\n\nLaster agreed with the plaintiffs, finding that the district violated a clause in the state constitution requiring \"free and fair elections.\"\n\nHowever, Laster refused to invalidate the results of the referendum, as the plaintiffs had sought. He argued districts have been placed in an untenable position because of the lack of property tax reassessments.\n\nBy law, counties are supposed to regularly reassess properties to make sure their value is up-to-date. But no Delaware county has done a reassessment in decades — New Castle County last did so in 1983.\n\n\"When the value of the tax base is fixed, the only way to raise revenue is to increase the tax rate,\" he wrote.\n\nLaster noted school districts' costs are constantly increasing \"because of inflation and because society regularly asks the public schools to take on greater burdens.\" So the lack of reassessments has made districts desperate to pass referendums for fear of painful budget cuts.\n\nSome officials think school boards should be allowed to raise taxes by small amounts without a referendum to account for growing costs. A bill that would grant that power is circulating among legislators but has not been filed yet.\n\nA draft version of that bill obtained by The News Journal would allow school boards to raise taxes unilaterally every two years. Those increases could be only 3 percent or a percentage change in the Consumer Price Index kept by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSchool boards could vote to increase those taxes to account for growing operation costs only. School boards would still have to go to referendum for capital requests, like building new schools or renovating old ones or for any major new projects.\n\nChanging the referendum process would not tackle the problem of reassessments, which has been a huge cause of frustration for school and civic leaders for decades. Groups such as the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council and the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission have called for systemic reassessments.\n\nBoth sides claimed victory after the Chancery Court ruling.\n\n“In these already challenging times, it would have been catastrophic for the district to have returned nearly $26 million, so we are frankly relieved that Judge Laster recognized that Red Clay acted in good faith in its public campaign asking our community for additional funding,” Red Clay Superintendent Merv Daugherty said in a statement. “It’s my hope that this lawsuit opens the door to a conversation about school funding in Delaware. As Judge Laster said, the system is broken and the solution to these issues is a reform of the school funding mechanism, which should be carried out by the General Assembly.”\n\nKathleen MacRae, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Delaware, called the ruling a \"victory for democracy and free and fair elections in Delaware.\"\n\nThough the ACLU had asked for the referendum to be overturned, the group said it understood the decision.\n\n\"Ultimately, this lawsuit was never about depriving school districts of the funding they need,\" MacRae said. \"We agree with the Chancery Court that there is dysfunction in Delaware’s system for funding public schools. We believe that Delaware’s system of school financing is badly broken.\"\n\nRep. Deborah Hudson, R-Fairthorne, supported the lawsuit, and she hopes Red Clay and other districts have learned not to tip the scales on referendum votes.\n\n\"Red Clay is an excellent school district, but they manipulated this election,\" said Hudson, whose district is in Red Clay. \"What I saw when I went to vote was so different than what I normally see during these referendums. I'm a little surprised that the chancellor didn't overturn the results.\"\n\nOver the past few years, many districts have struggled to win voter approval to increase taxes to cover growing operational costs. In some cases, those failed votes have led to teacher layoffs and program cuts.\n\nEven as the judge's ruling went public Wednesday, members of the Joint Finance Committee bemoaned the fact that reassessments were making their job of writing the state budget harder.\n\nThis is a statewide issue. Sussex and Kent counties have not updated their assessments since 1974 and 1987.\n\nPolitical leaders have been reluctant to implement reassessments because, while some residents would see property taxes reduced, some could see huge increases in their tax bills. And there is is a significant administrative cost to reassessing, particularly after years of inaction.\n\nHudson said \"it's probably time\" to do a reassessment.\n\n\"[The judge] is one more person that emphasizes that our school financing is completely tarnished,\" Hudson said. \"But it's very complicated, and it needs to be done right. I certainly think it's time we have that discussion, though.\"\n\nThe reassessment issue is particularly important to school districts because property taxes fund most of the \"local share\" of education funding, roughly 30 percent of each district's budget.\n\nDOCUMENTS:View the opinion\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/02/04/indian-river-schools-referendum-housing-boom-and-funding-odds-delaware-sussex/2858569001/", "title": "Indian River schools referendum: Housing boom and funding at odds", "text": "EDITOR’S NOTE: This article is available to you and possible for us to report because you are a subscriber.

Before that, it renovated and expanded its two middle schools. Now, the district is looking at expanding Cape Henlopen High School, which opened in 2010.\n\nCape Henlopen School District Superintendent Robert Fulton said most of the growth has occurred west of Delaware Route 1 from Route 24 all the way up to Milton.\n\n\"When we were looking at maps for where to put Love Creek, there were more elementary aged students closer to that school than any other school in the district,\" he said. \"So that was interesting, where kids live compared to geographical areas.\"\n\nBetween 2010 and 2017, the district has increased by 660 students, more students than the total number of students at Beacon Elementary School (606 students) last school year, according to the Delaware Department of Education.\n\nAnd, while Cape Henlopen is adding schools and appears to be in a good financial position, other districts in the state of Delaware have struggled. The last legislative session saw school budgets cut, including $11 million from the educational sustainment fund.\n\nBACKGROUND: Tax vote bears fruit with Cape school groundbreaking\n\nBACKGROUND: New Cape Henlopen school, Love Creek, taking shape\n\nThe Cape district did have to make cuts for the coming school year, Gumbs said, which included a $1.1 million cut from the state.\n\nThis was difficult, Gumbs said, because of the growth the district has undergone.\n\nThe fact that Love Creek is opening this year made it so the district could not cut any positions, he added.\n\nAs the district grows, however, it's better for the budget because they can earn more teaching units.\n\n\"We have people who are 100 percent funded by local funds, and that is always concerning for a school district, that’s not sustainable,\" he said. \"So our hope is that our enrollment keeps growing so we accumulate more Division I units, which are generated by a formula, so we can take them off local funding and fund them through the state units.\"\n\nA plan for the future\n\nWith the completion of Love Creek Elementary School and ground to be broken on the Sussex Consortium during the winter, Cape Henlopen finished a 20-year plan for growth.\n\nNow, the district is again focused on the future, planning for growth once again.\n\nRather than a 20-year plan, Fulton said the district is focusing on a five- to 10-year plan.\n\nBACKGROUND: Sussex County enjoys referendum success\n\nIn addition to building a new Rehoboth Elementary School, the district is going to remodel Milton Elementary School and remodel the Lewes School — which houses the Sussex Consortium — to take the place of Shields Elementary School.\n\nFulton also said the district has plans to expand Cape Henlopen High School, which opened in 2010, and build a third middle school in Lewes on the location of Richard A. Shields Elementary.\n\n\"It means people want to live where you are, people want to send their kids to your district,\" Fulton said. \"The key is the growth isn’t occurring faster than your facilities allow for, which is why we started planning the next steps, which is a third middle school, additions to our high school, those kinds of things.\"\n\nThe district has submitted the paperwork to the Delaware Department of Education to add on to the high school and build the new middle school, Fulton added, with results expected to come this fall.\n\nIf the plans are approved, the board would need to set a date for another referendum, Fulton said, which would most likely come in the spring of 2018.\n\nGoals realized\n\nWhile the district is waiting for word on its requests to come back from the department of education, one school is about to open and another is well underway.\n\nDirector of Facilities Brian Bassett said Love Creek Elementary is a special project for the district.\n\n\"This is what catapulted us into our last referendum to approve the other five schools,\" he said.\n\nThe district knows how lucky it is to be in the position it's in, Bassett said.\n\n\"Every school that opens, it seems like it’s up to that last day or two in August,\" Bassett said. \"It’s just such a mad dash. By the time you get your money and you start right away, you always run right up against the start date.\"\n\nIt's a lot less stressful for the district to open a building early, he added.\n\nAnd, further to the north, the new H.O. Brittingham Elementary School is even farther along than Love Creek was at this point last year.\n\nREAD MORE: Delaware schools offer breakfast to all students\n\nAt the Cape Henlopen Board of Education meeting on Aug. 24, Dean Johnson, president of Richard Y.

Brittingham is they are using the same design.\n\n\"It’s unbelievable,\" Bassett said. \"Winter should not be a problem at (H.O. Brittingham) because of the progress we have made. We were moving snow at Love Creek once in a while at some spots.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Fulton said the district is celebrating what it has accomplished thus far and looking forward to a new school year that will see the opening of the new elementary school.\n\n\"It’s hard not to get excited,\" he said. \"This is why we do what we do.

Those numbers are expected to keep growing.\n\nThe failed referendum would have added a new Sussex Central High School building, as well as eight classrooms to Indian River High School and four classrooms to Selbyville Middle School. The additions would have cost $140.84 million, $14.29 million and $3.38 million, respectively. The new high school building would have been built next to the school's current location.\n\n\"With our total enrollment projected to grow by more than 1,700 students during the next six years, we are still faced with a shortage of classroom space at several schools,\" Steele said.\n\nThe district says there is a \"good chance\" it will have to add outdoor classrooms, which look like double-wide trailers, on some of its campuses. Had the referendum passed, the district says, it would not have had to add as many — or keep them as long.\n\nThe district does not currently have outdoor classrooms on its campuses. They could appear by next year, officials say.\n\nSussex Central will likely be the first to see outdoor classrooms on its campus. But other campuses that might need them do not have the physical space, Steele said.\n\n“We’re going to have to look at every space-usage thing that we can think of,” Steele said. “We’re going to have to resolve it somehow.”\n\nTeachers, students struggling with overcrowding\n\nSussex Central High School is at the forefront of the school district’s case. It is so crowded, Steele said, that students \"shuffle\" through the school building \"like a large group of zombies.\"\n\nThe failed referendum would have replaced the high school's current building. The new building would have held 2,200 students.\n\nThe current high school building is meant to hold about 1,500 students, but is currently cramming in more than 1,660 students.\n\nThose at the high school say it has struggled with its growing population for several years, and it has since gotten worse.\n\n“We’re certainly bursting at the seams now,” said Bruce Copeland, who teaches 12th-grade English at Sussex Central. “It really does make teaching and interacting with everyone much more difficult.”\n\nCopeland averages about 30 students per class, and says he struggles to get “one-on-one time” with all of his students to make sure each is absorbing the curriculum. Copeland said he has 34 desks squeezed into his classroom, which in years prior have all been filled.\n\n“There’s no way, in a 70-minute period, that I can do that with every single student,” Copeland said. “Not anything meaningful. Not anything that’s really going to stick. We can kind of skim the surface and touch on a few things, but we can’t dig deep.”\n\nTeachers are working to accommodate to the large class sizes, Copeland said, but have limited time and resources for teaching material that they think could “enhance” or “enrich” the lesson.\n\nTeachers are also more likely to spend less time on grading papers if they total 120 students across their classes.\n\n“I’m going to kind of skim through and spend maybe 6 or 7 minutes instead of that 10 or 12 minutes that I would like to,” Copeland said. “It really forces me to narrow my focus and, really, not give a true assessment.”\n\nPlus, the more people in a classroom at once, the more likely someone is to be distracted.\n\n“All it takes is two or three people to pull out their phones or make some random comment,” Copeland said. “If you have over 30 students, the chances are that’s going to happen much more frequently.”\n\nSupport local journalism: 6 benefits of a Delmarva Now digital subscription\n\nOther teachers are likewise managing 30-plus students per class, Copeland said. He added that physical education teachers sometimes have to keep track of 40 students per class.\n\n“It’s easy to lose track,” Copeland said.\n\nIt’s not just in the classroom. The overcrowding affects students throughout the day, Copeland said.\n\nTeachers and students have trouble even running to the bathroom between classes because hallways are so crowded, Copeland said. At lunchtime, students may have to wait in line for more than 10 minutes before getting their food.\n\nLunch periods at the high school are 30 minutes long. The earliest begins shortly before 11:40 a.m. and the latest begins at 12:55 p.m. The district says that it may have to begin adding earlier or later lunch shifts if enrollment continues to grow.\n\n“They barely have the time to actually eat their lunch and socialize before they have to run off to the next class,” Copeland said.\n\nAnnouncements or emails are sometimes sent out to excuse students for being tardy to class because they didn’t get lunch on time, he said.\n\nEven if they do have time to eat, students still have to fight the flooded hallways just to get to class, those familiar with the school say.\n\n“We do have a really good environment here, a healthy environment, a diverse population,” Copeland said. “But, typically, when things are crowded, that raises tensions. That may raise tempers (between students) as well.”\n\nThe crowded building makes some students less patient, Copeland said.\n\n“Instead of taking the time to actually engage with each other and to learn from each other, I think that everyone is in a hurry,” Copeland said. “They don’t have time for that extra stuff. When, in my opinion, that extra stuff is where they have that opportunity to learn and to grow.”\n\nSussex Central High School is not the only Indian River school dealing with overcrowding.\n\nNine of the district's 16 schools already exceed capacity, meaning the student population is more than 90 percent of the building occupancy. That includes the three schools that would have been expanded via February's failed referendum.\n\n\"When you have 90 percent in the building ... legitimately, you're full,\" Steele told Delmarva Now in December.\n\nSussex Central is at 111 percent capacity. Indian River High School is over capacity at 95 percent with 950 students, and is estimated to reach more than 100 percent capacity by 2022. Selbyville Middle School is at 102 percent capacity with about 740 students.\n\n“We haven’t given up,” Copeland said. “We would just love to have more community support in doing so. What we’re doing here affects everyone.”\n\nOther schools crowded, too\n\nThe district has had similar referendums in recent years, including one that passed in March 2017 to fund additional school services and address enrollment growth.\n\nBefore that, the district failed to pass that same referendum in November 2016 after the district's chief financial officer was put on leave and a subsequent state audit, released less than a week before the vote, revealed several instances of \"inappropriate\" spending on items such as designer bracelets.\n\nSince then, the district has implemented transparency efforts, including a budget oversight committee formed when Steele became superintendent in 2017.\n\nIndian River isn't the only school system grappling with enrollment changes.\n\nThe Cape Henlopen School District has seen a near-1,500-student increase in enrollment since 2001. Like Indian River, the district expects that enrollment to keep growing.\n\nIn March, Cape Henlopen was able to get voter approval to add elementary schools and a middle school, as well as additional space for its high school, within the next several years.\n\nThe countywide Sussex Technical School District, meanwhile, hopes to reinstate its 1,400-student enrollment cap during this legislative session that began last month. The state General Assembly in 2015 mandated the vocational high school lower that cap to 1,250 students as a cost-saving measure, among other requirements.\n\nThe district wants that cap lifted, especially as applications grow.\n\n\"We had more than 800 applicants this year, a record number, and are able to accept less than 300,\" said Sussex Tech Superintendent Stephen Guthrie in a statement Wednesday.\n\nSussex Tech thinks it can make the case, since Indian River is grappling with overcapacity in its schools.\n\nLegislators spoke with the Sussex Tech board members about the enrollment policy on Wednesday. It’s unclear what lawmakers will decide for the vocational district.\n\nGuthrie said that any change would be “phased in gradually over time,\" but has suggested that an increase in enrollment could help \"alleviate\" Indian River's overcrowding.\n\nBut any enrollment increase for the high school would likely be less than 200 students — a fraction of the several hundred spaces that Indian River says it needs.\n\n“I don’t see where that’s helpful to us at all,” Steele said, adding that Sussex Tech admits students from across the county.\n\nMore:Too many students in one building?

Capano, was trying to answer that question when she wedged herself into the white Igloo cooler that played a grisly role in one of the most sensational and dramatic court cases in Delaware history.\n\nIt was a key piece of evidence in the haunting case that still resonates 20 years after Capano's November 1997 arrest because it echoes current headlines: men in positions of power trying to exert absolute control over their alleged victims.\n\nThe 12-week trial kept the public riveted from October 1998 to January 1999.\n\nCapano had apparently stuffed the 5-foot-10-inch body of his younger, secret girlfriend, Anne Marie Fahey, into the ice chest after she was shot to death at his home with a gun bought by Deborah A. MacIntyre, one of his other longtime mistresses. Capano, married with four daughters, would later blame MacIntyre for Fahey's death.\n\nThe day after Fahey's mysterious June 1996 death, Capano, with the help of his youngest brother, Gerry, used the cooler to transport Fahey's body to Gerry's boat Summer Wind at Stone Harbor, New Jersey.\n\nSummer Wind motored east about 60 to 75 miles, Gerry testified, where he then gave his brother an anchor and chain and turned his back on the scene unfolding on deck. Gerry told the court that Tom Capano vomited, then put a body into the ocean. According to testimony, he turned around in time to see a human foot sink into the deep waters.\n\nTom Capano told his attorney Joseph S. Oteri that he first rejected putting Fahey's body into a brand-new garbage can. Instead, Capano used a 40½-gallon cooler, purchased two months before Fahey's death. Capano’s brother Joseph, who died of a heart attack in 2015, said he told Tom to buy the cooler as a gift for brother Gerry.\n\nTwo and half years after Fahey died, the jury hearing Capano's murder trial was sequestered at the Hilton Wilmington/Christiana near Stanton.\n\nDeliberations lasted three days.\n\nCapano case:For complete coverage, including past stories, videos and more\n\n\"Honestly, a lot of people would be surprised to know that when we first went in to deliberate, first thing we did was take a poll to see where everybody stood and it was half and half,\" said Lee, who counted herself among the not-guilty votes.\n\nLee recalled one of the jurors said: \"'We should see if she could really just fit [into the cooler].'\"\n\nLee, 28 years old at the time and known as Erin Reilly, was just a few inches shorter and weighed about the same as Fahey. Sitting at a big table in a hotel conference room, she felt all eyes on her.\n\nAlthough one of her fellow jurors said she didn't need to do it, Lee agreed to climb into the 3-foot-8-inch hard-plastic cooler that served as a makeshift coffin. She left her high heels on to compensate for Fahey's height.\n\n\"This is important,\" Lee remembers telling herself. \"It's important for everybody. It's important for me because I didn't know.\"\n\nJurors helped the young woman into the cooler and then watched as Lee tried to \"squoosh myself smaller\" to give others an accurate picture.\n\n\"My eyes were closed for sure,\" she said. \"I'm not sure why. Probably because I didn't want to see.\"\n\nAs jurors attempted to shut the cooler's lid, Lee recalls being surrounded by a darkness she had never known.\n\nIn court testimony, Capano said he laid Fahey's body into the cooler on her side. He said he pushed her knees into a fetal position but insisted he broke no bones to make her body fit. Capano also said he had wrapped her body in a cotton blanket.\n\nBut Lee and the other jurors soon learned it wasn't the gentle tuck-in Capano had described.\n\nAs Lee squirmed inside the cooler, the lid wouldn't close. And that's when some of the jurors realized Fahey's bones might have been broken, or worse, to make the corpse fit.\n\nThe macabre situation, and the enormity of what had happened to Fahey, suddenly became real and overwhelming.\n\n\"OK,\" Lee remembers another juror saying. \"That's enough. Let's get her out.\"\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, a traumatized Lee asked a bailiff to escort her to her hotel bedroom. Lee sat alone and sobbed.\n\nTears fell for Fahey, a troubled, insecure, single woman who wanted to end an off-and-on, three-year affair with the then 46-year-old Capano, a controlling, jealous, married lover who wouldn't let her walk away.\n\nAs she cried, Lee, only two years younger than the victim, said she spoke to Fahey: \"I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.\"\n\nThe climb into the cooler-turned-casket convinced Erin Reilly Lee and the jury of five other women and six men that Capano was a manipulative liar, a cold-blooded killer.\n\nIt was Capano who shot Fahey, the jury determined.\n\nWilliam Swain Lee, the Superior Court judge who presided over the trial, said he was walking on the beach Saturday, January 16, 1999, when his beeper went off.\n\n\"I had to run about a mile to get back to my car, drive to my house to get to a telephone, and call in,\" he said.\n\nThe jury had reached a verdict.\n\n\"We had to go find everyone,\" Judge Lee added. \"The lawyers were in different restaurants in a three-state area. So, the soonest we could get together was Sunday morning and I did not think that once it was announced that the jury had reached a verdict that we could take a day off.\n\n\"We needed to get it out, so I scheduled the unusual Sunday morning session.\"\n\nSunday morning the jury found Capano, then 49, guilty of the first-degree murder of 30-year-old Fahey, a scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper.\n\nJudge Lee sentenced Capano to death.\n\nIt was a stunning fall from grace for the prominent Wilmington attorney who had once counseled a Delaware mayor and governor and was the privileged, eldest son of a well-known Italian custom home builder. In just 31 months, Capano had gone from admired power broker to pariah.\n\nFrom Fahey's disappearance on June 27, 1996, to Capano's conviction on Jan. 17, 1999, the public devoured every morsel of information uncovered. The trial spawned four books and a 2001 TV movie that starred Mark Harmon as Capano.\n\nMore:Prosecutor Colm Connolly: Tom Capano tried to take a hit out on me\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Search set for Carper assistant\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: 300 Join in Fahey search\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI search for Fahey may go on\n\nThe case was revived again in 2006 when Capano's death sentence was overturned. A life sentence was his punishment.\n\nBy then, years of confinement and isolation on death row had begun to take its toll. Capano, overweight with sallow skin and a wispy, white beard, no longer resembled the fit, polished, man-about-town he had once been.\n\n\"He had gained a massive amount of weight since the trial,\" said Colm F. Connolly, the unflappable federal prosecutor who led the investigation and endured Capano's intense hatred, which included verbal attacks and, at one point, plans to put a hit on him.\n\nCapano died of a heart attack on Sept. 19, 2011, at age 61 at the Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, where he was serving the life sentence.\n\n\"He ate himself to death; there's no question about it,\" Judge Lee said.\n\n\"His father died of a heart attack, he knew he had a heart condition. Once his appeals ran out, I think it was suicide by food,\" said Lee, who retired from the bench nine months after the trial and now lives near Rehoboth Beach.\n\nMore:'This is Tom, Tom Capano,' said the man on the phone\n\nCapano's obituary said he \"was many things to many people, but most of all he was a loving father who will be greatly missed by his [four] daughters.\"\n\nIt touched upon Capano's love of music and places in Wilmington, some no longer open. The man the family called \"Tommy,\" the obituary said, was known for \"his impeccable taste: blasting old classics – the Temptations, the Four Seasons, Aretha Franklin, Frank Sinatra, or the Rolling Stones – at full volume while waiting to pick up pizza from Gallucio's; allowing his daughters to skip school on their birthdays for a luxurious lunch at the Rodney Square Club; ordering an assortment of mouthwatering seafood from DiNardo's with extra Old-Bay seasoning.\"\n\nThe obituary did not mention the murder conviction.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano held in murder of Anne Marie Fahey\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: The Capanos: A house in ruins\n\nTwenty years after he was arrested, the Thomas J.

Maurer Jr. wrote in an essay for The News Journal.\n\n\"Tom was an impossible client, pushing the envelope at all times and making the representation quite unpleasant. Ethical boundaries were of no consideration to him in formulating his defense strategy, as was demonstrated by the evidence at trial.\"\n\nAdded Maurer: \"Instead of a challenging and fulfilling professional experience, the representation of Tom Capano was one of the most depressing and disappointing professional experiences of my life.\"\n\nJoseph S. Oteri, the Boston lawyer who led Capano’s “Dream Team,” was more blunt about representing Capano: “I made a bad mistake in taking a lawyer for a client.”\n\nOteri said he is usually the man in charge. But Capano’s insistence on running the case got in the way.\n\n“He was taking advice from people in the jail rather than the people he was paying for and it was tough,” Oteri told The News Journal. “It didn't make me feel anything but pissed off because I kept saying, ‘You're paying me an enormous fee and you're not listening to me. How stupid can you be?’”\n\n“‘Nah, nah,’” Oteri quoted Capano as saying. “We're doing fine. We're all right.\"\n\nJudge Lee said it was tough going for the defense.\n\n“Capano was always confident he was going to win and it was clear he considered himself smarter than his excellent group of lawyers,” the judge said.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Cooler found in Fahey case\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: FBI sought weapons in Capano's home\n\nAnne Marie Fahey wanted – and believed – she had escaped Capano's dominance and intimidation.\n\n\"For one whole year, I allowed someone to take control of every decision of my life,\" she wrote in her diary April 7, 1996 – one of the final entries.\n\nHer plan was to move forward with a kind man younger than Capano. It was not to be. A little more than two months after that last entry, Fahey was reported missing.\n\nFahey's remains have never been found. One of the few places to mourn and remember her is a memorial bench erected in 2006 that sits in Wilmington's Brandywine Park. “In our hearts forever,” reads the inscription.\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Power broker now pariah\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Guilty as charged\n\nEvidence from the case, relatively untouched since 1999, today collects dust in a vault at the Leonard L. Williams Justice Center on Wilmington's King Street, formerly called the New Castle County Courthouse.\n\nIt serves as both an elegy and a 1990s time capsule with cassettes and videotapes of interviews with Capano's brothers, handwritten lists of state and defense witnesses –– and pieces of a life that ended much too soon.\n\nUsually, evidence is given away to the defense or destroyed after a defendant’s death.\n\n\"This is the only dead person I still have evidence for,\" said Colleen Redmond of the Prothonotary's office as she looked over items from the trial.\n\n\"The court said we shouldn't get rid of it,\" despite Capano’s death six years ago, she said.\n\nFolded up is a then-fashionable, size 6, cream-and-blue floral Laura Ashley dress. It is possibly the long, springtime dress Fahey bought to wear to Winterthur's Point-to-Point steeplechase races with her boyfriend Michael Scanlan, then community affairs chief of MBNA America Bank, whom she hoped to marry.\n\nAuthorities believe one of the reasons Capano killed Fahey was his jealousy of Scanlan, a devout Catholic who testified his relationship with Fahey was not sexual. Scanlan didn't know about Fahey's involvement with Capano until after her death.\n\nAccording to his Linkedin profile, Scanlan left MBNA in June 1999 and is now assistant headmaster at St. Benedict's Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey. He also works as a photographer shooting high school sports, portraits and does some commercial work.\n\nGone from the evidence vault are Fahey's wallet, jewelry box and the diary that gave investigators much-needed clues that pointed to her murderer. Her family took those items years ago, court officials say.\n\nBut, still in the vault are the copies of letters mistress MacIntyre wrote daily to Capano in prison before she turned on him in February 1998 and became a key witness for the prosecution. Some of the letters from the divorced MacIntyre, a Capano girlfriend for more than 15 years, begin with the greeting, \"Hey Handsome.\"\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Death for Capano\n\nMore:ARCHIVE: Capano found dead in prison\n\nFinally, there are two 162-quart Igloo ice coolers – one used as a demonstration in court, and one the actual cooler, and Fahey's coffin. Inside of it rests a 12-gauge shotgun.\n\nIn one of the case's most surprising twists, the abandoned cooler was found floating in the Atlantic Ocean by four fishermen about a week after Gerry Capano unsuccessfully tried to sink it by firing a slug into it with a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun.\n\nThe fishermen, who kept it in a shed, turned it over to prosecutors the day after reading media accounts of Capano's arrest in November 1997.\n\nJudge Lee, in a recent interview, said it is astonishing that the cooler had been discovered off Indian River Inlet, 100 miles from where it had been thrown into the ocean.\n\n\"It's certainly stranger than fiction, the truth,\" Judge Lee said. \"My reaction was Tom Capano should know there really is a God now.”\n\nConnolly said bringing the actual cooler into court on Dec. 2, 1998, just before the state rested its case, still stays with him nearly 20 years later.\n\n\"I will never forget that moment. It was dead silent. It was a dark day, so not much light was coming in the windows of the courtroom,\" he said. \"Ferris and I walked the cooler in front of the jury. It was as if we were pallbearers carrying the coffin into the court.\"\n\nJuror Erin Reilly Lee, no relation to Judge William Swain Lee, still gets chills seeing pictures of the Igloo cooler.\n\n“Oh my gosh,” she told The News Journal after viewing photos. “You talk about divine intervention. There’s a great example.”\n\nWharton, now a Superior Court judge, said the court retains all the evidence while there's still ongoing litigation. But, after a defendant's death, it is then offered to the defense and/or destroyed after a period of time.\n\n\"It would surprise me if they got rid of all that evidence just because of the interest in it. People kept wanting to look at it for various reasons,\" Wharton said.\n\nOn the anniversary of Capano's arrest, The News Journal has asked some principal players to recall their memories of the investigation and trial.\n\nEssays and \"As Told To\" stories include thoughts from Connolly and Wharton, defense attorneys Maurer and Oteri, retired Judge Lee, former News Journal reporter Valerie Helmbreck, former Wilmington restaurateur Anthony Stella, juror Erin Reilly Lee and psychiatrist Neil Kaye.\n\nTime has a way of fraying memories and, 20 years later, some participants have slightly different versions of the same story and others share never heard before details. The News Journal has tried to clarify and add context to some of their words using information from court records and articles from the paper's archives.\n\nStill, some of the people who were caught up in Capano's web of lies are more than ready to put the past behind them.\n\nMacIntyre is remarried and now working at the American Society of Cytopathology, a nonprofit organization in Wilmington. The office is near the old Daniel L. Herrmann Courthouse, now the home of the law firm Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor. In the old courthouse two decades ago, she talked about her longtime affair with Capano and about buying a gun for him six weeks before Fahey died.\n\nMacIntyre, known now as Debby MacIntyre Sheldon, declined to be interviewed.\n\nWhen reached by The News Journal via email on Nov. 13, she replied: \"I have no interest in talking about the case. Best regards, Debby MacIntyre Sheldon.\"\n\nThe Fahey family declined to be interviewed or write about their memories.\n\nAfter Anne Marie’s disappearance, her brothers, sister and extended family said they decided as a group to talk to media to keep attention on the case.\n\nWhile family members were concerned they would appear as seeking attention, they felt it was proper to keep the case in the public eye, and keep pressure on the Capano family.\n\nAfter the trial, the Faheys decided as a group to stop talking to the media, and to draw no more attention to themselves.\n\nMembers of the Capano family reached by The News Journal declined to comment.\n\nThe Thomas J. Capano case captivated Delaware that's known, for better or worse, as a clannish community, especially concerning its native sons and daughters.\n\n\"What's your name? Where did you grow up? Where did you go to high school?\" are frequent questions that start a connect-the-dots conversation about common acquaintances.\n\nTies could be made to Capano and Fahey, both from large Wilmington-area families with high-profile jobs.\n\n“You have Anne Marie Fahey who worked for the governor and she had a family that a lot of people knew. She was very attractive and very personable, and young,” Wharton said.\n\n“Everybody knew of the Capanos. He (Tom) was very prominent. He had been a prosecutor, a public defender, the administrative assistant to the Wilmington mayor. Capano had been a partner in a couple big law firms, Morris James and Saul Ewing. He had been the governor's legal counsel. And everybody knows of Capano because of all the development that they did,” Wharton said.\n\nFor a few days in the summer of 1996, the disappearance of Anne Marie Fahey seemed to be little more than a missing person case.\n\nYears before being selected as a juror, Erin Reilly Lee remembers longtime friends talking about search parties being formed for a missing woman who’d grown up near her childhood neighborhood.\n\nFahey, a pretty and vivacious woman, went to dinner on June 27 with Capano at Ristorante Panorama on Front Street in Philadelphia. The eatery, which is still there, was considered one of the city's great wine destinations and featured classic Italian cuisine.\n\nCapano, married for 24 years, had recently separated from his wife. Going to Philadelphia was his routine. He had multiple mistresses and liked to take them on dates far away from his home and nosy, prying eyes in New Castle County.\n\n\"Wilmington is a small town, a gossipy place,\" he said on the witness stand on Dec. 17, 1998.\n\nAccording to a waitress that night, dinner wasn’t going so well. Capano ordered the food without consulting Fahey. They drank wine and picked at calamari and bruschetta, both looking miserable.\n\nFahey had met Capano in 1993, and wrote in her diary she fell in love with him on her January 1994 birthday. He lavished her with attention, gifts and visits to expensive restaurants. Capano also knew some of Fahey’s hidden secrets, such as she suffered from eating disorders.\n\nIn September 1995, Fahey met Scanlan, who was unmarried and closer to her age. She wanted to end the affair with Capano. But when they left the Panorama restaurant at about 9:30 p.m. June 27, it would be the last time Fahey was seen in public.\n\nTwo days later, family and friends, concerned that she failed to keep a dinner date with Scanlan at her brother’s house, went to her 1718 Washington St. apartment on the third-floor and found it empty. They also find a diary Fahey kept where she wrote that Capano was “a jealous maniac.”\n\nCapano was questioned twice on June 30 at his $2,000 a month rental home at 2302 Grant Ave. in the city’s Highlands neighborhood. Police looked through his home and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, but, at that time, found no signs of Fahey.\n\nMissing person photos of Fahey, a blue-eyed beauty with dark, curly hair, and yellow ribbons begin appearing on telephone poles, trees and signs around Wilmington. A billboard went up on I-95. Her family started a vigil on the front porch of the Washington Street apartment. They frequently met up at O’Friel’s Irish Pub, a then-popular bar in downtown Wilmington. Time marches on and the bar has closed. The building went up for sale in 2001 and later became a salon and spa.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton called Fahey’s boss, Gov. Tom Carper, now Delaware's senior senator, whom Fahey had worked for since her 1991 graduation from Dover's Wesley College.\n\nOn July 5, 1996, Clinton said the federal government would help with the search. However, it seems he forgot to notify the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Delaware, according to Connolly.\n\n“I was in the grocery store, the Acme on [U.S.] 202, and I ran into Judge Greg Sleet, who was the U.S. attorney, my boss. The lead story of The News Journal that day was President Clinton offered federal assistance. Judge Greg Sleet and I laughed because Greg Sleet was the U.S. attorney, so he was the chief federal law enforcement officer, and nobody had contacted him,” Connolly said.\n\n“If you were really going to get the feds involved, you would contact him. He said, 'Well, I'll call over to Wilmington, and we'll offer our services.' The next working day, July 8, the FBI called us.”\n\nState prosecutors later agreed to bow out of the picture. A federal grand jury investigation, which had to remain secret, began.\n\nConnolly, leading a team of investigators, began methodically chipping away at the investigation by conducting interviews, searches, and combing through phone and financial records.\n\nOn July 26, 1996, he and Wilmington police investigator Bob Donovan discovered, through financial records, Capano had made a purchase at a company listed as Wallpaper Warehouse two days after Fahey was last seen in public alive.\n\n“I knew enough about Capano at that point, because we're a week or so into the investigation, I know that he was not the kind of guy who does home improvements himself. I know he's living in a rental house, so he wouldn't be buying wallpaper. I thought it was very weird,” Connolly said.\n\nThey called the number, the person who answered said, “Airbase Carpet.”\n\n“Immediately, Bob and I looked at each other, and thought, 'Oh my goodness, he rolled her up in the carpet. That's what this is all about,'\" Connolly said.\n\nInvestigators also learn later Capano has replaced a love seat, and an employee of Capano’s brother, developer Louis L. Capano Jr., tells them on July 1 he was ordered to have a half-filled trash bin emptied from a Concord Pike construction site.\n\nThey also find Capano has visited a Happy Harry’s store in Trolley Square on June 30 and asks about a blood remover.\n\nInvestigators search Capano’s house for 11 hours on July 31 and find two tiny drops of blood that they later learn matches a sample of Fahey’s blood plasma.\n\nA search takes place Aug. 12-16 of two local landfills to try and find the rug, sofa and other evidence. The search is messy, and officers come up empty.\n\nA turning point arrives in October 1997 when federal agents raid the Wilmington home of Capano's brother Gerry and find illegal drugs and guns.\n\nCapano's brothers Gerald and Louis agree to began cooperating with the authorities in November 1997 to avoid federal charges.\n\nGerry becomes a cooperating witness. He tells authorities that he took out his boat, Summer Wind, and helped Capano dispose of a body in the Atlantic Ocean on Friday, June 28, 1996. He provided other incriminating evidence, including getting rid of a sofa with a basketball-sized bloodstain, and a rug.\n\nHis brother Louis says the stained sofa and rug were put into a dumpster on one of his properties.\n\nAfter the brothers began cooperation with the prosecution as part of a plea agreement, Capano is arrested on Nov. 12, 1997.\n\nWharton said Capano seemed to think he could get away with murder. Why?\n\n“Because he always had. He had done a lot of bad things that nobody ever called him into account for and he thought he could control things,” Wharton said.\n\n“He thought the investigation would be confined to the Wilmington police looking for a missing person which they were never going to be able to find.”\n\nIn February 1998, Deborah MacIntyre, a longtime Capano girlfriend, also signs a plea agreement and becomes a witness for the prosecution. She shares that she bought a .22-caliber gun at Capano’s request. It has never been recovered. MacIntyre also turns over her steamy letters she wrote to Capano and begins taping phone calls he makes to her from prison.\n\nAn outraged Capano asks an inmate, Nicholas Perillo, to arrange to burglarize MacIntyre’s house to intimidate her. The burglary never happened.\n\nDefense attorney Maurer will later accuse MacIntyre of firing the shot that killed Fahey. She vehemently denies it.\n\nThe case takes a twist when Capano attorney Joseph A. Hurley announces in early April 1998 he's quitting the defense team. Hurley, who had been friends with Capano for at least eight years, at that time would give no reason saying only that he will take it \"to his grave.\"\n\nOn Friday – 19 years later – he shared for the first time exclusively with The News Journal that a moment of moral clarity came to him while attending a funeral Mass at St. Helena's Catholic Church in Penny Hill for public defender James F. McCloskey Jr.\n\nHurley sat in a pew, in his childhood church, and said he had a conversation with God.\n\n\"I can only surmise that there was something making me feel like I was falling into an evil pit and this conversation, if that's what you have with God, [went] 'Joe, you're not like this. You can't be this way.'\"\n\n\"I think I was probably facing the reality he was, in fact, guilty of premeditated murder,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe said he'd never asked Capano what happened the night Fahey disappeared.\n\n\"I didn't want to ask him and hear the answer,\" Hurley said.\n\nHe left church, went to see Capano in prison and quit the case.\n\nNo longer considering him a friend, Hurley never saw Capano again.\n\n\"Killing a human being? No. That's the end of friendship,\" Hurley said.\n\nCapano’s trial begins Oct. 6, 1998, with jury selection. Capano’s attorneys try to talk him out of selecting young women.\n\n“The last thing we wanted on a jury was women under 30 with a college education because they would identify immediately with the victim,” Boston lawyer Oteri said.\n\nJudge Lee recalled after the women were included on the jury, he was approached by Oteri who said, \"'Can I go off the record, Judge?' And I went, 'Sure. Off the record.'\"\n\nOteri said: 'The dumb son of a bitch thinks they are going to fall in love with him.'\"\n\nOteri told The News Journal last week that he didn't recall the conversation.\n\nJudge Lee said he didn't know Capano when \"he had the reputation of being a charming man, but in the setting in which I knew him, he was more rodent-like. He was a frightening, scary figure. There was nothing charming about him at all.\"\n\nOteri, who joined the defense team only months before the trial started, drops a bombshell in his opening statement: He says while Capano did dump Fahey’s body at sea, she died from an “outrageous, horrible, tragic accident.”\n\nCapano claims Fahey was shot to death accidentally by MacIntyre in a jealous fit of rage, while she was attempting suicide. \"His story is nonsense,\" Wharton said.\n\nAnd it just gets keep getting stranger.\n\nNeil S. Kaye, a psychiatrist who met Fahey hours before she meets Capano for dinner, shows up to testify in a wooden hat. It earns almost as much attention as what he has to say about Fahey’s fear of ending her relationship with Capano because of his “rage and anger.”\n\nKeith R. Brady, who is then Delaware’s chief deputy attorney and Wharton’s superior, is called to testify about a sexual encounter he had five years earlier with MacIntyre while Capano watched. Capano has said he was supposed to golf with Brady the day after Fahey's death. Connolly questions him on the stand for the prosecution, and Oteri delves into the encounter with MacIntrye. Brady takes an unpaid leave of absence after leaving the stand.\n\n“I don't think Keith ever really accepted the fact that he was going to be a witness. He always thought that was not going to happen,” Wharton said. “We were very discreet about that, the way we phrased our questions, but Oteri was not. Keith looked like he was a dead man up there.”\n\nConnolly reads up on Capano’s cases when he was prosecutor and believes the Wilmington lawyer killed Fahey based on a 1976 murder Capano had prosecuted. Connolly says a man called Robert “Squeaky” Saunders shot a victim in the head, threw the body in a canal and disposed of the gun.\n\nConnolly also continues to get under Capano’s skin. In a burst of anger, he calls Connolly “a heartless, gutless, soulless disgrace of a human being” and is removed from the courtroom.\n\nA final last-minute surprise comes when a neighbor of MacIntyre comes forward in the remaining few days of the trial to say she saw a sobbing MacIntyre stumble out of her car on the night around when Fahey is killed. The neighbor claims the area was lit by floodlights.\n\nBut Connolly tracks down a Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, handyman who says he installed a new, brighter light fixture at MacIntyre’s house – six months after Fahey’s death.\n\nNearly 20 years later, the trial continues to be surreal for Erin Reilly Lee, whose willing venture into Fahey's plastic coffin helped bring focus to a divided jury and sealed Capano’s fate.\n\nHer journey began in Trolley Square, where Lee lived nearly oblivious to the developing Capano-Fahey saga.\n\nShe received a jury duty summons but was certain there were too many similarities between her and Fahey to be picked for jury duty. Lee went to the courthouse believing she would be sent away soon.\n\nWharton remembers that day. “Erin Reilly was a potential juror. She came in, in a plaid sort of jumper. She could have been Anne Marie Fahey. Tall, attractive. The defense lawyers wanted to strike her, but Capano insisted on keeping her because, I think, he thought, he could charm her.”\n\nAt voir dire, the process through which potential jurors are questioned by either the judge or a lawyer, Lee was interrogated then asked to leave the courtroom. When she returned, she was stunned when the judge said she’d been selected.\n\n“My brain just kind of stopped,” she said. “I was so shocked that I looked at him and I said, ‘I’m sorry. Excuse me, what did you say?’”\n\nShe remembers the somewhat taken aback judge reiterating that she’d been selected as a juror.\n\n“I kind of didn’t really hear a whole lot after that because I was thinking, ‘My mom is going to kill me. How am I going to be on this trial?’” Erin Reilly Lee said.\n\nAs the monthslong trial began, Lee watched the attorneys present evidence and question witnesses who would later help her, and others jurors, reach their conclusions. This includes Connolly questioning Capano about how he placed Fahey in the cooler.\n\n“Colm Connolly did such a phenomenal job of getting us to think about, could he really place this girl’s body into a big fishing cooler,” she said. “The way he would just keep pushing Tom.\n\n“Tom said, ‘I had this cooler that I was going to give to my brother and I panicked and so I just figured I’d put her body in there.’ ”\n\nBut Connolly kept pushing, wanting to know – and the jurors – if the body easily fit in or if bones had to be broken to make it fit.\n\n“When we were deliberating, it’s something that we kept coming back to,” Lee said. “You know, could she just fit?”\n\nWhen Lee didn’t fit, jurors realized that Capano was lying. It made it easier to find holes in other parts of his testimony.\n\nConnolly’s ability to bring out the anger in Capano, showed jurors another picture of the former prosecutor who, on the stand, was portraying himself as a meek man.\n\n“Colm did a great job at letting us see [Capano’s] anger and how he could turn,” she said.\n\n“It definitely was surprising. It’s not something I ever would even thought of happening in Wilmington, Delaware.”\n\nContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.

School referendums splinter communities", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nVoters are set to consider three referendums statewide that would would raise almost $500 million.\n\nSchool district officials say they're forced to ask for money because of the state's complex funding system.\n\nThe regular referendums have sparked tension among voters who are asked to fund education.\n\nSpring is the time of year when education turns into politics, when school districts give residents a choice: Vote to raise property taxes or face teacher and program cuts.\n\nNobody — not seniors, not parents, not even school officials who say the money is desperately needed — like asking for a tax hike.\n\nSchool supporters and parents bemoan the fact that educators and parents are forced to campaign for referendums, rather than focus on teaching children.\n\nWhat's frequently misunderstood by citizens is that referendums are often intended only to keep the status quo, supporters say. But Delaware's complex school funding system has made it difficult to convince voters the increases are necessary to cover growing student enrollment and maintenance costs.\n\n\"There's so much time and energy that has to be poured into it, it's just hundreds and hundreds of man hours,\" said Eve Buckley, a Christina School District parent who is one of the volunteer leaders in an effort to pass that district's referendum on Wednesday. \"And it's time you're using just in hopes of staying where we are, maybe getting a little better, not providing some big new idea. The process is a real drain.\"\n\nBrandywine and Cape Henlopen also are seeking voters' approval that day. The three referendums combined would raise almost $500 million.\n\nThe success of those votes comes down to whether district officials can coax enough parents with children in public schools to go to the polls. They must outnumber those who don't feel they have a stake in the schools or who feel districts should do more to prove they deserve a tax increase.\n\n\"If I go to my boss and haven't done what I'm supposed to ... I don't ask for a raise,\" said Susan Welsh, who wants to see Christina begin to improve student test scores and find efficiencies before she votes in favor. \"I love my child enough to vote 'no' and hold them [the district] accountable to raising the ranking before I give them a raise.\"\n\nDistrict supporters say referendums aren't a luxury. They are a necessity.\n\nMoney that pays for schools is a mix of state, federal and local funds. While the state's portion grows as districts enroll more students, the local portion comes from property taxes that don't increase to match growing costs.\n\nIf districts don't get the money to cover those costs, the results can be demoralizing, Buckley says.\n\n\"You want to think you're part of a community that is at least reasonably supportive of public education, and then something like what happened last year takes place,\" she said. \"And then you start to worry about this negative feedback loop, where people think the district isn't worthy, so then we have to cut budgets. And that means the schools suffer, and the perception only gets reinforced.\"\n\nActing Christina Superintendent Bob Andrzejewski says its dangerous to leave districts without a steady, reliable base of funding.\n\n\"There are no reruns when it comes to education,\" he said. \"If a student misses out on important educational services because there's no money, you can't go back and make that up later.\"\n\nChristina is seeking about $16 million, which would amount to roughly $192 a year more in taxes for the average homeowner, according to the district. That money would be used to plug some of the holes left after the district slashed $9 million from its budget last year and would also add some new programs.\n\nBrandywine is asking taxpayers for money to cover operating expenses, for work on school buildings and to put synthetic turf on its athletic fields. It estimates that an average home-owner would pay an extra $243 per year for the next three years and $206 per year after the $1.7 million turf project will be done. The district needs $19.3 million for the building projects and $9.5 million for operating expenses.\n\nThe referendum in Cape Henlopen is a little different – it is asking voters for money that would be used strictly for building two elementary schools and doing work on two others, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999. The total cost for the project is $154.5 million, but local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder $48.4 million of it.\n\nSwaying the public\n\nThe base of the bloc that typically votes against referendums is believed to be older residents who don't have children, don't directly benefit from the tax increases and are often on fixed incomes.\n\nOlder residents vote more than younger residents. And low-income families are less likely to vote than more affluent families, who may not send their children to traditional public schools, Buckley said.\n\nThat stacks referendums against the districts.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge, no question,\" Buckley said.\n\nIn Christina's first referendum last year, when voters slapped down a tax increase by an almost three-to-one margin, turnout in more affluent suburban areas dwarfed turnout in poorer urban areas.\n\nSTORY: Robocalls used in Christina schools referendum\n\nSTORY: Wilmington redistricting plan advances on shaky ground\n\n\n\nIn five polling places in Wilmington, there were a total of 258 votes. At a single suburban polling place – McVey Elementary, just off the University of Delaware campus – more than 556 people voted.\n\nThe vote failed 2,119 – 6,076.\n\nWhen Christina took a second shot with a smaller referendum last year, the district made more energetic efforts to get the word out to voters, and turnout evened out somewhat. The referendum failed again, but this time by less than 900 votes out of more than 11,000.\n\n\"The support's there,\" said Brian Stephan, a parent with two children in Christina and co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee. \"It's just tapping into it and letting them know where to be and what you're voting for.\"\n\nPart of the problem, supporters say, is that the state's school finance system is so complicated.\n\nStephan points out that school referendums are the only time residents get to choose whether to tax themselves. For other taxes, elected representatives choose when to raise rates; citizens vote those representatives out if they don't like their choices.\n\n\"It's the one chance that people get, so they tend to vent some of their frustrations,\" he said. \"It doesn't just become about school taxes, it's all taxes. And that makes it hard for us.\"\n\nReferendum opponents do frequently bring up other tax proposals.\n\n\"The governor wants to put more money in for the gas tax, he wants to give more money to the casinos,\" said Marie Lulfs, a 76-year-old Christina resident. \"Everybody wants more money, and where are they getting it from? The taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nNobody knows the impacts of a failed referendum quite like Christina parents and teachers.\n\nAfter voters twice rejected tax increases last year, the district made more than $9 million in cuts, laying off 78 teachers and 14 aides.\n\nStephan's daughter's first-grade class has 37 students, far more than last year.\n\n\"That has been an extreme challenge for her teacher and for her,\" Stephan said. \"You can just tell when she comes home from school.\"\n\nSupporters like Stephan say it is hard to make voters understand that operating referendums don't necessarily mean a district is seeking new goodies. In some cases, like Christina's, they are simply asking for enough money to preserve the level of services.\n\nAbout 55 percent of Christina's budget comes from state funding, while 38 percent comes from local property taxes (the rest comes from federal sources).\n\nThe state's share of school taxes grows as the district adds students, but the property tax revenue doesn't always do so.\n\nUnlike many states, school taxes don't automatically adjust for inflation. So when costs of things like fuel and electricity go up, the money a district gets from property taxes buys less and less.\n\nIf more of the budget goes toward overhead, there is less available for educational programs.\n\nThat argument hasn't convinced some referendum opponents.\n\n\"They got $20 million five years ago – it didn't do anything,\" said Welsh. \"So what's this $16 million going to do? There's no proof in the pudding.\"\n\nA better system?\n\nMichael Griffith, who studies school finance issues at the Colorado-based Education Commission of the States, said local school funding mechanisms vary widely from state to state. When it comes to picking the best method, he said figuring out \"the one true religion is probably easier than this.\"\n\nMost states require voter approval for school tax increases, he said. But many allow districts the choice to occasionally raise taxes by a small amount, usually tied to an inflation rate, without going to voters.\n\n\"If you believe in public education, as we do, the quality of our childrens' educational experience should not depend on a vote,\" Andrzejewski said. \"There are very few states left in the country that require referendums for operating expenses.\"\n\nAndrzejewski, who was previously Red Clay superintendent and has worked on several referendums, argues the state should move to a similar system. Delaware's vo-tech school districts, he points out, are given the ability to raise taxes up to a certain cap before getting the General Assembly's approval.\n\n\"There is a politically accepted, viable model that Delaware already has,\" Andrzejewski said. \"School board members are elected officials just as the General Assembly is. They should be trusted to make a prudent financial decision on behalf of the community.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, Andrzejewski said a system like this would allow districts to raise taxes gradually over time, instead of periodically hitting them with one big increase all at once. Inflation rates are typically under two percent; by contrast, Christina is looking for a 21 percent increase in its tax rate.\n\nThere are two big caveats, Andrzejewski says.\n\nFirst, school board members should be required to get financial training and should be penalized if they don't.\n\nAnd second, districts should still be required to go to referendum for major new programs or building campaigns.\n\nAre schools 'electioneering?\n\nAnother problem is Delaware districts are sometimes accused of employing underhanded tactics to get the votes they need.\n\nThe same day Christina's first referendum failed in 2015, Red Clay passed one. Almost immediately, some residents cried foul.\n\nMany Red Clay schools held parent engagement events on the night of the vote in their buildings, which serve as polling places. Several older voters said those events crowded parking lots, denying them parking spaces that were close enough for them to make it in to vote. It also boosted turnout among parents.\n\nAn ACLU of Delaware lawsuit over those claims is still making its way through the courts. Red Clay maintains that it took sufficient steps to provide enough parking and argued it frequently holds events at schools to keep parents engaged in their kids' education.\n\nSTORY: Christina School District takes third try at referendum\n\nSTORY: UD to make SAT optional\n\nState Sen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, received numerous complaints from constituents.\n\n\"Last year's Red Clay district referendum was the poster child for what's wrong with the whole system,\" Peterson said. \"There was so much electioneering that went on inside the polling places that it was just an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nPeterson says this isn't the first time a district has been accused of electioneering, referencing a so-called \"Pizza-gate\" incident a few years ago in which Smyrna schools threw pizza parties at schools on referendum night.\n\n\"I couldn't stand inside a polling place and hand out pizza if you voted for me,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson has proposed a bill that would change how districts go out to referendums.\n\nFirst, schools could only seek one referendum a year, at the same time as school board elections. That would save the state Department of Elections money and force districts to make one pitch for what they really need.\n\nThe fact that districts often come right back with referendum requests if a previous one fails upsets many opponents.\n\n\"If you say 'no' once, I mean 'no,\" Lulfs said. \"You don't have to keep shoving it down my throat.\"\n\nPeterson's bill would also have referendums conducted via mail. That would make more voters aware of the issues, she said, and prevent the inherent problems in having polling places that directly benefit from the results of a vote.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about all this going on at the schools,\" she said.\n\nWhile Peterson argues these changes would make the system fairer, she agrees with some school supporters who say broader change is a good idea.\n\n\"These districts can get in a really bad place, because this is money they really do need,\" she said. \"But you're asking people to vote for a tax on themselves. Something has to change.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

At less than half, that's down two percentage points from 2022. And in the last 2022 NAEP scores, the state's fourth grade learners scored well below the national average in reading, ranking lower than 39 other jurisdictions.\n\nDelaware's Department of Education pointed to as much in its own budget hearing last week.\n\n\"Let me be clear, our third grade literacy reading scores are not acceptable,\" Mark Holodick, state secretary of education, told lawmakers. He said the state must focus on boosting literacy. The discussion came among many topics in the JFC hearing — from the growing special education unit spending, to allowing districts to catch up to several curriculum-based bills, like the science of reading and Black history instruction.\n\nGov. John Carney is recommending $2.1 billion to DDOE in fiscal year '25, with some $3 million dogeared for early literacy coaches. That would fund 20 coaches to be deployed across schools as needed. This joins Delaware's framework of adding \"high-impact tutoring\" in many high-needs schools, having been one of five state's to receive $1 million in grant funds last year to fuel the integration.\n\nCarney also included a first wave of recommendations from the Public Education Compensation Committee on salary increases across education employees, among other investments in a tight year.\n\nMORE:Breaking down education funding in Delaware's proposed 2025 budget\n\nDelaware State to host second annual conference aimed at supporting Black youth\n\nDelaware State University's \"Black Male Initiative\" is a conference focused on supporting Black men from school to career. The event aims to gather high school students from across Delaware, business professionals, educators and community leaders to Dover for the second time.\n\nThis year's conference — \"Empowering Excellence: Elevating Black Male Leadership in the 21st Century\" — should kick off at 9 a.m. Thursday, Feb. 22.\n\n\"Attendees will be able to explore themes such as masculinity, personal identity, entrepreneurship and socioemotional learning,\" the website reads. \"Through insightful workshops, inspiring keynote speakers and meaningful discussions, participants can gain valuable insights, develop a deeper understanding of their identity, and build the skills needed for personal and academic success.\"\n\nOfficial registration has closed, per DSU's site, but there may still be sponsorship opportunities and other ways to get involved.

Delaware?\n\nLong a darling of secretive limited liability companies, the First State is building a reputation as a prime location for out-of-state art collectors and investors to park their multimillion-dollar masterpieces and reap the tax benefits.\n\nIn the last two years, New Castle County has seen a proliferation of maximum-security art storage companies, including several Manhattan offshoots, that lock up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of paintings and sculptures by Old Masters and buzzworthy emerging artists.\n\nBut ordinary citizens will likely never see this work, including a 10-piece rocket installation.\n\nThat's because many of these one-of-a-kind creations will never leave their crates.\n\nArt buyers, including those more passionate about diversifying their portfolios than enjoying their artwork, can ship their purchases directly to Delaware storage facilities and avoid paying sales tax for as long as the items remain here. For the Manhattanite, that amounts to a nearly $900,000 savings on a $10 million painting.\n\nThe advantages don't stop there. Delaware doesn't tax inventory, it recently repealed its estate tax and it offers less expensive land for storage facilities ideally situated between New York and Washington, D.C., art experts say.\n\nAs Geneva and New York crack down on an opaque art market reeling from money laundering and tax evasion scandals, Delaware shines as a pro-business beacon, one that is, arguably, less likely to suffer loss from terrorists, natural disasters or art capers.\n\nSTORY: Delaware's unemployment rate continues to climb, bucking national trend\n\nSTORY: DTC's 'Something Wicked': Dazzling theatrical rocket ride\n\nSeveral storage companies offer direct, weekly shuttle service from Delaware to New York –– and back again. Masterworks are transported from cavernous warehouses straight out of \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to New York City showrooms crawling with potential buyers.\n\n\"I've never been treated so courteously, friendly and positively than in Delaware,\" said Fritz Dietl, who owns the Delaware Freeport in a Newark, one of at least five art storage companies in Delaware. All are located in New Castle County.\n\n\"There's no better place to do business in the world.\"\n\nDietl, an Austrian-born New Yorker, went one step further than his local competitors by securing a Foreign-Trade Zone designation from U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2015. That means art shipped from abroad enters duty-free to his 36,000-square-foot warehouse.\n\n\"Think about it like playing Monopoly,\" says Patricia Cannon of the state Division of Small Business, Development and Tourism. \"No one can hurt you on home base.\"\n\nSince touting tax savings is considered gauche, Dietl and others emphasize that their facilities, collectively totaling more than 200,000-square-feet, benefit the broader community — not just their ultra-wealthy clientele — by bringing in new jobs, investment in derelict buildings and spinoff business for local accountants, lenders, lawyers and art conservators.\n\nDelaware also gains notoriety by catering to the high-powered art world, the business owners claim.\n\nBut local art lovers question the direct benefit to the First State. Each storage facility employs only a handful of people, their high-value holdings do nothing to boost government coffers and few, if any, storage sites have partnered with area museums to develop a lending program, which has been established in other states.\n\nRepresentatives from the Delaware Art Museum, Winterthur Museum and the Brandywine River Museum said they haven't been approached to display the stockpiled art, and they don't even know what's there.\n\nWinterthur has paid a couple of local facilities to store empty crates during temporary exhibitions, according to museum registrar Beth Parker Miller.\n\n\"Having someone in our backyard is a little more convenient,\" she said. \"Winterthur doesn't generate that much business for them.\"\n\nArt storage operators say their clients are a mix of dealers, pure investors, museums, inheritors of art both local and abroad, and collectors who own multiple homes with limited wall space.\n\n\"You keep collecting. That's an addiction,\" Dietl explained. \"That addiction feeds our warehouse.\"\n\nLocal gallery owners report they don't know any Delawareans who would want their collections stuffed in crates rather than on display.\n\n\"The people I know aren't buying paintings of mass value so they can store them and resell them,\" said Vicki Manning, co-founder of Somerville-Manning Gallery in Greenville.\n\n\"My clients are buying the work for their enjoyment.\"\n\nBehind the iron curtain\n\nLike bars of gold at Fort Knox, Delaware's hidden treasures are buried in unmarked, video-monitored fortresses in large industrial parks with multiple barriers to entry.\n\nThink of them as offshore banks for art, flush with million-dollar fire suppression systems and industry-validated climate controls — all in an effort to provide maximum assurance that their precious cargo is safe and secure.\n\nCompanies refrain from listing exact locations on their websites. Of the four that granted access to The News Journal, two refused to allow photographs of the actual storage areas. Others obscured packing slips.\n\nClient identities, along with the provenance of the art and the total value, remain a mystery.\n\n\"Discretion is a huge concern for our clients,\" acknowledged Derek Jones, executive director of Atelier Art Storage and Services near New Castle.\n\nEach storage facility is slightly different in terms of size, layout and market niche, but all sell square footage in large, open-air rooms filled with racks of artwork and unopened boxes, along with handling packing and shipping. Most also offer private rooms that function as glorified safety deposit boxes for customers seeking an added layer of security and anonymity.\n\nIntimate gallery spaces within the warehouses allow clients to have pieces inspected and appraised away from prying eyes.\n\nThat's where Kristin deGhetaldi comes in — escorted, of course.\n\nA graduate of the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, deGhetaldi can size up an easel painting's condition, analyze particular pigments and document any travel damage (which, she says, rarely happens).\n\nThe painting conservator has expanded her business by servicing local art storage facilities about once a month. The facilities, in turn, appreciate the local expertise and use it to help recruit clients.\n\n\"It's a particular niche that Delaware can fill,\" explained deGhetaldi, who also teaches at UD.\n\nLaunched in 1991, Bayshore Fine Art Storage is among the oldest of Delaware's art storage facilities and one of two local, family-owned businesses, along with Hopkins & Sons in New Castle. Both were longtime moving and storage companies that carved out a specialty in art.\n\n\"My stepfather got a call out of the blue one day from a private collector in California who asked if we could build him a room,\" said Bayshore Vice President Matt Larmore, who now operates two art storage facilities near Glasgow totaling 60,000 square feet. \"We've been growing the business ever since.\"\n\nThe company constructed vaulted chambers within its warehouses – described as buildings-within-a-building – to maximize security.\n\n\"The insurance guys like to tease me,\" Larmore said. \"We've built in so much redundancy but we are constantly asking ourselves what we can do better.\"\n\nLarmore admits he's not an art aficionado, but three of his competitors are. All came to Delaware within a six-month span in 2015.\n\nFirst was Philadelphia-based Atelier, which oversaw the relocation of the Barnes Foundation's 4,000-piece collection from Lower Merion to Philadelphia in 2012. Atelier put down roots in Delaware in the summer of 2015, largely thanks to Mati Bonetti de Buccini, wife of real estate developer Chris Buccini whose company The Buccini/Pollin Group has spearheaded the redevelopment of Wilmington.\n\n\"When we moved from New York City, I saw that Delaware had something unique to offer when it came to art storage,\" recalls Bonetti de Buccini, now director of Atelier's 40,000-square-foot space. \"I met with Derek and instead of competing we decided to partner up.\"\n\nAtelier's facility comes equipped with a fleet of 15 GPS-monitored vehicles that resemble refrigerated trucks to appear inconspicuous. Some big-ticket collections inside the warehouse necessitate their own heads of security and biometric readers that authenticate fingerprints.\n\nShortly after Atelier moved in, Crozier Fine Arts, a known commodity on the Manhattan and Hamptons art scenes, opened its seventh U.S. facility four miles away. The company was recently acquired by Iron Mountain, a $10 billion Boston-based document storage company.\n\nCrozier's more unusual art occupants have been Napoleon Bonaparte's hat and an enormous painting made of bubblegum that had to be stored flat.\n\nThe 41,000-square-foot New Castle warehouse is run by Randall Brockett, a striking figure with chin-length hair and a slight European accent whose romance with a Russian-born real estate magnate briefly captured the attention of New York City gossip columnists.\n\nWhile giving a tour to U.S. Sen. Chris Coons last month, Brockett noted that Crozier previously leased space from Bayshore to test the market. He applauded Delaware for its panoply of tax advantages, explaining that short-term clients are lured here because they can get in and out quickly with minimal fuss.\n\n\"All we want is for them to have their private jet serviced and incorporated in Delaware,\" the Democrat senator joshed.\n\nInternational intrigue\n\nPrivate jets are a fixture at Le Freeport Luxembourg, conveniently located next to the country's only airport with a paved runway.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, Christie's operates a fine art storage facility within the Singapore FreePort. An auction house spokeswoman declined comment for this story.\n\nGeneva pioneered the freeport concept more than a century ago with bonded warehouses that temporarily housed commodities like grain and tea. Today, more than $100 billion in goods, including Van Goghs, Picassos and Gaugins, are believed to be held in Switzerland's custom-free zones. Freeports also store fine wines, diamonds, rugs, vintage cars, musical instruments, cigars and taxidermy.\n\nThe difference between a freeport and a regular art storage warehouse is that freeport clients are exempt from paying import taxes or duties, which can be 5 to 15 percent of the work's value. And if an artwork is sold at a freeport, the transaction tax is waived.\n\nNot surprisingly, this high-roller world has attracted controversy. The leaked Panama Papers in 2015 revealed that an alleged Nazi-looted painting by Modigliani had been stored in Geneva's tax-free vaults.\n\nFor the past two years, Yves Bouvier, owner of Geneva Freeport and partner in a Singapore facility, has been embroiled in a high-profile dispute with a Russian billionaire over selling works at huge markups. Bouvier has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nSimilarly, billionaire international art dealer Guy Wildenstein was accused of hiding art and assets in a maze of foreign trusts and moving millions of dollars in artworks from New York to Switzerland. He was cleared of tax fraud earlier this year.\n\nArt storage is definitely a rich man's game, acknowledged Dietl, who wears a pressed shirt and sparse beard. \"When you invest in stocks, you don't pay use or sales tax. Art has become an asset in the same way.\"\n\nEdged with sunflowers, the Delaware Freeport shares grounds with a purveyor of forklifts and rail siding. Just past the loading dock and stark white viewing room, Dietl offers a glimpse behind the steel veil: Art stored at a comfortable 69 degrees with 50 percent relative humidity.\n\nA high school dropout who launched an art transportation company a quarter-century ago, Dietl says he has worked with every major museum around the world and relies on word-of-mouth advertising. Clients are charged a few dollars per square foot a month.\n\nDelaware art storage facilities generally charge customers 20 percent less than equivalent facilities in New York, according to Karen Boyer, founder of Elements in Play, a New York-based art advisory firm.\n\n\"If you're buying a $3 million painting and don't plan to hang it for a period of time, it makes perfect sense,\" she said.\n\nDelaware Freeport is one of only five sites in the state certified as a foreign-trade zone, along with the Port of Wilmington, the juice importer Citrosuco, the Delaware City Refinery and the Wilmington pharmaceutical company Noramco. Dietl pays the state $10,000 a year for the designation, according to Cannon, director of intergovernmental relations and special projects for the state economic development office\n\nIt's a \"marketing pitch,\" she said. Art has to be more than 100 years old for the customs duty to apply, anyway, \"and they’re not moving in and out of Delaware too often.\"\n\nBut the pitch apparently worked. Dietl says he's at capacity and is scouting a second Newark location to double his storage space.\n\nShipping art two hours south from New York is safer and more cost-efficient than sending it to halfway around the world, he said.\n\n\"It makes us the absolute equivalent to the Geneva Freeport.\"\n\nSoon, New York's first freeport could give Dietl and Delaware a run for the money.\n\nThis fall, ARCIS will open a 110,000-square foot facility in Harlem that can store as much as 2.5 billion worth of goods duty-free. Like the Delaware Freeport, ARCIS clients' valuables will be exempt from U.S. duty and excise taxes until they exit; New York state sales tax may still apply.\n\nLocated at a global epicenter for art and finance, the four-story, sustainable building is responding to pent-up demand after about 165,000-square-feet of art storage space that disappeared from Manhattan last year because of property turnover, according to ARCIS Executive Director Tom Sapienza.\n\n\"I don't see Delaware as competition,\" he said, explaining that ARCIS boasts the largest dock in the tristate area and was built to conform with the strict specifications of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. Security features include both retina and vascular scanning upon entry.\n\nThe art storage market is boundless, according to Sapienza, because \"every day more art is being created.\"\n\nMarket research backs him up. While the mercurial art market contracted in 2015, global art sales are still estimated to be from $45 billion to $57 billion annually.\n\nLast year, nearly two-thirds of art collectors reported that investment returns were an important motivating factor in purchasing art compared to 47 percent in 2014, according to a Deloitte Luxembourg & ArtTactic Art & Finance Report.\n\nThat's troubling to art buffs like Barry Schlecker, who has been known to hyperventilate in the presence of a folk art piece made of mud or molasses. He now owns more than 400 of them and estimates his collection is worth around $50,000.\n\n\"To buy a piece of art and stick it in a vault so you can't see it and enjoy it – I don't get it,\" said Schlecker, who produces the Brandywine Festival of the Arts.\n\nHe acknowledged the lucrative business potential, however.\n\n\"I guess whenever you go to McDonald's, you're going to find a Wendy's or Burger King.\"\n\nHome-court advantage\n\nDespite the saturated landscape, Delaware's five art storage facilities have yet to join forces with dozens of museums across the state.\n\nOther states, like California, offer collectors tax exemptions if they ship an artwork to a museum in a state without sales tax and display it there for 90 days. When the piece is ultimately sent back, California waives its 7.25 percent sales tax and the museum exposure can boost the value of the art.\n\nBoth the Portland Art Museum and Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art at the University of Oregon have benefited from this arrangement. The Schnitzer Museum advertises on its website the tax benefits of its Masterworks on Loan program.\n\nBut don't expect the Delaware Art Museum to try something similar.\n\n\"We only take loans when the loans make sense for us,\" said Heather Campbell Coyle, the museum's chief curator.\n\nThe museum already displays less than 5 percent of its collection due to space constraints, she continued. Loaned artwork must fit into the exhibition schedule and allow \"us to present something meaningful to our community.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Manning said she agreed to present works loaned to her by California collectors looking for a tax break. She won't do it again.\n\n\"I can bring in work of that quality and have it for sale in my gallery,\" she explained.\n\nJohn Schoonover, grandson of popular Wilmington illustrator Frank Schoonover, said he doesn't begrudge art storage companies and their clients for making a buck.\n\nAsked how his grandfather, a former pupil of Howard Pyle, would react if his Hopalong Cassidy and Joan of Arc images were heaped in a plywood crate somewhere, the gallery owner responded diplomatically.\n\nIt \"goes with the territory\" of being a commercial artist, he said.\n\n\"Most of my artists are dead so they're not going to complain.\"\n\nTax deferral or tax dodge?\n\nThe art owners aren't complaining either. Experts say Delaware offers collectors – particularly pure investors – a number of tax advantages found in few other states.\n\nChief among them is Delaware’s lack of sales or use tax. Delaware is one of only five states hawking that benefit, and the only one in the Mid-Atlantic.\n\n“It’s a huge difference, especially over a place like New York City where most of the art transactions originate,” said Jack Sullivan, a tax and corporate law attorney based in Manhattan.\n\nNew York City’s sales tax is 8.875 percent. Buy a $10 million painting in the Big Apple and have it shipped to Park Avenue? That’s an $887,500 tax bill.\n\nBut ship it to the home of tax-free shopping and the tax bill is a whopping zero.\n\nThere’s only one catch:\n\nThe sales-tax savings evaporates if the same New York City collector decides to retrieve the work from Delaware and hang it on his living room wall. That event is supposed to be reported in tax filings, but it's an honor system that experts say often gets ignored.\n\n\"It’s no different than when someone from Pennsylvania buys a TV at Best Buy in Wilmington and does not pay tax on it once they get home,” Delaware accountant Jordan Rosen said. “Enforcement is not what it could be and people are not as honest as they could be.” The system is fraught with \"chicanery,\" Sullivan agreed. Auction houses may claim to ship art to Delaware or a tax haven in Europe, but \"it really goes out the back door.\"\n\nSince gaming the system with a flat-screen TV is less of a financial hit to the government than, say, an N.C. Wyeth painting, state attorneys general have stepped up their investigations of tax-dodging art collectors.\n\nLast year, the Swiss Parliament also tightened regulations for freeports, after clients began shipping their work to less scandal-tainted locations, including in Delaware.\n\nTodd Levin, director of Levin Art Group consultancy in New York, advises his clients to just pay the sales tax in their home state and be done with it.\n\n\"In most cases, I'm not convinced that every T is crossed and every I is dotted,\" he said of the storage facilities.\n\nThat's a non-issue in tiny Delaware. Even the dead here get a tax break.\n\nThe General Assembly last summer voted to repeal Delaware’s estate tax, which tops out at 16 percent. Starting Jan. 1, that could save millions of dollars for the estates of the deceased that own more than $5.5 million worth of paintings and antiques stored here.\n\n“The repeal of the estate tax is a huge, huge thing that was on my wishlist for the past year,” said Brockett, the Crozier manager.\n\nAnother incentive for out-of-staters is that if they form a trust in Delaware, they can avoid paying estate taxes in their home state, according to legal experts.\n\nA trust is a legal entity similar to a small corporation that can hold assets, such as cash or property, and \"lend\" it to heirs tax-free. Trusts can last forever in Delaware, unlike in most states.\n\n“Artwork is something of a natural fit for a dynasty trust,” said Scott Swenson, a partner at Connolly Gallagher who heads the Delaware Bar Association’s estates and trusts section. “It means your family can retain it in perpetuity as long as it is legally owned by the trust.\"\n\n\"And the art can physically reside anywhere.”\n\nDespite those advantages, New York lawyers who work closely with high-wealth art collectors claim that Delaware's tax benefits are a bit overblown.\n\nSteve Schindler heads the art law group for the firm Schindler Cohen & Hochman and chairs the art law committee for the New York City Bar Association. Collectors often ignore the sales tax imposed by their home states, he said, and hire competent professionals to mitigate estate taxes and other costs.\n\n“I think there’s some clever marketing going on here,\" the Manhattan attorney said. “In my personal experience, I’m not seeing clients overwhelmingly gravitating to Delaware.”\n\nContact Margie Fishman at (302) 324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.

None of the former leaders responded to requests for comment.\n\nBoard Chairman John Cochran declined an interview request.\n\nIn a statement, the retired Bank of America executive said there is \"no one-size-fits-all\" approach to contract negotiations.\n\n\"Employment packages often involve a mix that includes deferred compensation, retirement contributions, and items such as bonuses earned in one year that may be paid out over multiple years,\" he wrote.\n\nTaken together, such line items represent the full value of an executive's compensation, which is rarely reported, in total, to the public, according to George Mason University public policy scholar James Finkelstein, who has reviewed hundreds of university president contracts.\n\n\"We call it the CEO-ization of university leadership,\" he said.\n\nState. Sen. John Kowalko called UD's compensation packages \"excessive.\"\n\nFor years, the Newark Democrat has rallied unsuccessfully to open up the state's land-grant universities to increased public scrutiny.\n\n\"Until you let the public see how you're doing these things, you are and you should be suspected,\" he said.\n\nUD is slated to receive about $120 million from the state this fiscal year, about 11 percent of the university's total budget. The university is not obligated to publicly disclose the details of its executive compensation packages other than what it reports to the IRS.\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly considers UD, like Delaware State University, a quasi-public agency, which means most of its records are off-limits to the public.\n\nUD President Dennis Assanis, for instance, took over in 2016, but the university won't release his base salary or total compensation package.\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle has consistently voted against broadening public access to UD records and meetings.\n\nThe university \"is not a state agency in the true sense of the word,\" the Sharpley Republican said recently, noting that taxpayers finance a small portion of UD's billion-dollar budget.\n\nLavelle and his wife, Ruth, work as managing directors for Puglisi & Associates, a Newark accounting firm founded by UD Trustee Don Puglisi. The senator said his votes are unrelated to his employment, which predates Puglisi's time on the board.\n\nAsked about UD's payouts to former top executives, Lavelle wrote in a statement: \"I'm concerned about the increasing cost of higher education across the country. I think all universities should manage all of their expenses.\"\n\nLieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long, a former state senator and representative, works as a nursing professor at UD.\n\nTo determine how much money the university paid former administrators, The News Journal pieced together the information from the university's Form 990s, which tax-exempt organizations file annually with the IRS.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n• Before stepping down in July of 2007, former University President David Roselle earned about $875,000 a year, making him the highest-paid public university president in the nation. Post-UD, Roselle has received nearly $1.9 million. This is in addition to the more than $2.45 million he earned during his final year at the helm, according to IRS records.\n\n• K.C. Keeler, who during the Great Recession was granted a 10-year contract extension to stay on as head football coach through the 2017 season, was fired in January of 2013. Keeler, who earned a salary of more than $300,000, received nearly $2 million from UD in 2013, despite working for roughly one week that year, IRS forms show.\n\n• Former President Patrick Harker, who left UD midway through 2015 to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, earned nearly $817,000 that year, or about 86 percent of his compensation the previous year. For six months of 2015, Harker was also employed by the Fed. His salary at the central bank has not been disclosed; his predecessor, Charles Plosser, earned $350,000.\n\nIt's not certain if Harker or other recently departed UD executives are due more payments from the university; UD won't file its form 990 for fiscal year 2017 until next year.\n\nFormer Provost Domenico Grasso, who resigned in October from a $641,000-a-year position for what he called personal reasons, is now on a one-year paid administrative leave.\n\nAfter that, Grasso plans to return to UD to develop a program in engineering and environmental policy.\n\nReached by phone recently, the former chief academic officer likened the leave to a faculty sabbatical.\n\n\"I took a sabbatical back in 1996 and I have worked constantly,\" Grasso said, before rushing off the phone.\n\nUD Vice President for Finance and Deputy Treasurer Greg Oler signs UD's 990 forms, but would not comment on the compensation portion.\n\n\"Attracting and retaining the best talent is vital in helping our University and students thrive and grow,\" he said in a statement.\n\nPrivate dollars, not taxpayer funds, are used to pay executive compensation at UD, according to university spokeswoman Andrea Boyle. University leaders receiving post-employment payouts earned that money while they were still working at UD under the terms of their contracts, she said. State law doesn't cap how much top administrators can receive.\n\nThe Board of Trustees' special compensation committee, whose meetings aren't open to the public, sets compensation packages for key executives.\n\nThe committee relies on benchmark data from peer institutions and a third-party consultant who reviews proposed compensation for \"reasonableness,\" Boyle said. The IRS recommends a similar process to determine \"reasonable compensation\" at private universities, according to its website.\n\nUD trustee Joan Coker, a Wilmington doctor who has served on the board for three years, said the full board is not privy to executive contract negotiations. She declined to name the members of the compensation committee.\n\n\"Literally, this is the first time I've heard this,\" she said of the university's post-employment payouts.\n\nParting gifts common\n\nNationwide, universities like UD dangle exit perks to recruit the best and brightest managers, according to research by Finkelstein and his colleague, Judith Wilde, chief operating officer of George Mason's Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nIn evaluating more than 100 employment contracts for university presidents, the pair found that 40 percent contained deferred compensation clauses, allowing executives to delay receiving a portion of their income, such as retirement benefits, until after they enter a lower tax bracket. The value of such arrangements ranges from $17,000 to $500,000, according to the study by Finkelstein and Wilde.\n\nSeventy percent of contracts gave university presidents a direct pipeline to tenured faculty positions, recouping most of their previous salaries even if they don't teach any classes, according to the researchers.\n\nNearly half of the contracts guaranteed presidents a year-long sabbatical at their full presidential salaries, while 13 percent offered contract completion bonuses of $50,000 to $1 million – unless the presidents were fired for cause, such as in cases of embezzlement or sexual harassment.\n\nEven when presidents are fired, they emerge as winners in severance agreements that protect colleges and universities from costly litigation. Last summer, for instance, outgoing Northern Illinois University President Doug Baker received a $700,000 package in a closed-door meeting with university trustees, after a state investigation detailed his mismanagement of the university.\n\nGolden parachute clauses written into university president contracts have been around for decades, just as private CEOs and college coaches continue to earn eye-popping rewards. Over the years, the perks have filtered down to other high-ranking university administrators like provosts and finance chiefs, Wilde said.\n\nMembers of the business elite, who populate university boards, are comfortable paying top dollar for talent to compete with private universities and the corporate sector. To that end, they sweeten contracts with allowances for housing, cars, entertainment and country club memberships, along with generous payments for unused sabbaticals and sick time that aren't available to faculty and other staff.\n\n\"If you add in all the extras, the contract could be twice [the base salary] or more,\" Wilde said.\n\nThe public City University of New York system, for instance, paid $19,500 a month to house its Chancellor James Milliken on the Upper East Side as part of his annual $670,000 compensation package. Milliken's rent in 2015 was roughly on par with an adjunct instructor's annual salary in the university system.\n\nOn the opposite coast, California has cracked down on executive compensation at public universities. In 2012, public outcry prompted the Board of Trustees of the California State University system to cap pay raises for new presidents at no more than 10 percent of their predecessor's earnings.\n\nIn 2015, the trustees barred the university system, which receives billions of dollars annually from taxpayers, from financing executive pay with foundation funds. The move came after a state audit revealed that university executives' salaries and benefits were significantly higher than those awarded to state employees with similar job functions.\n\nBut reining in executive compensation has real consequences, according to Raymond Cotton, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has negotiated compensation packages for hundreds of university presidents.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year, Cotton insisted that executive benefits prevent star academic talent from going elsewhere.\n\n\"In the business world, those people who bring substantial benefit get substantial pay,\" he said.\n\nCollege and university presidents have far-reaching responsibilities, including essential fundraising tasks. They also work in tumultuous, highly politicized environments. On average, chief executives at S&P 500 companies remain in their positions a decade or more, but university presidents typically leave before 7 years, according to a recent study by the American Council on Education.\n\nIRS records show that UD is not the only Delaware university to handsomely reward executives on their way out.\n\nSTORY: At Wilmington University, it's all in the family\n\nSTORY: University of Delaware Provost steps down for personal reasons\n\nThe last time the Chronicle of Higher Education published data on the highest-paid private university presidents for 2014, then-Wilmington University President Jack Varsalona led the pack with his more than $5.4 million compensation package. The bulk of that amount came from a one-time retirement bonus that Varsalona received after more than 25 years of service at the commuter school.\n\nMichael Townsley, Wilmington University's former senior vice president and chief financial officer, stopped working for the university in fiscal year 2002, but received more than $911,000 three years later as part of a supplemental retention and retirement plan, IRS forms show. Former Provost Betty Caffo, who retired in 2011, received more than $2.2 million the following calendar year, including $2 million in \"other compensation.\"\n\nLike UD, Wilmington University has declined to discuss its employment contracts.\n\nAt Goldey-Beacom College, which counts fewer than 3,000 students, former president Mohammad Ilyas earned nearly $1 million in retirement bonuses in 2015, bringing his total compensation that year to nearly $1.5 million.\n\nIlyas retired from the Wilmington college on June 30, 2015, but his compensation that year included accumulated sick time dating to 1975, Goldey-Beacom Executive Vice President Kristine Santomauro said. Goldey-Beacom's board of trustees has since nixed that policy and no longer automatically offers senior managers deferred compensation plans, she said.\n\nSantomauro declined to release current president Gary Wirt's contract, explaining that Goldey-Beacom is a private institution.\n\nDespite the secrecy surrounding lucrative top administrator contracts, universities aren't internationally trying to deceive the public, according to Finkelstein, the researcher. Federal tax forms \"only require you to report what an individual received in that year.\"\n\n\"The public isn't asking the right questions,\" he said.\n\nWhose legacy?\n\nRoselle, a mathematician credited with ushering in a renaissance at UD, also earned substantially more money than his predecessors.\n\nPast president E.A. Trabant, who served for more than two decades beginning in 1968, earned less than $121,000 in his final year, according to a 1991 News Journal article. Trabant's successor, Russel Jones, who served for less than two years, earned a nearly $138,000 salary. Following Jones, Trabant took over briefly before Roselle came on board.\n\nA former University of Kentucky president, Roselle was known as a soft-spoken straight-shooter who was fiercely protective of UD's national reputation. His name now graces the university's performing arts venue.\n\nWhile Roselle's $875,000 compensation package outshone those of presidents at institutions twice UD's size, he was praised for transforming the university into a respected and financially secure institution over his 17 years at the helm.\n\nRoselle nearly quadrupled the university's endowment to $1.2 billion, shepherded the construction or renovation of about two dozen buildings, and boosted endowed faculty positions, student study abroad opportunities and student aid programs.\n\nWhen Roselle retired in 2007, the university senior administration counted one provost, one executive vice president and six vice presidents at a cost of nearly $2.5 million, according to IRS forms.\n\nWhen Harker stepped down eight years later, UD had one provost, one deputy provost, one vice provost for research, one executive vice president and nine vice presidents at a cost of nearly $4.7 million.\n\nFormer UD employees said spiraling executive compensation under the Harker administration has dragged down the university since the recession, forcing UD to consolidate departments amid state budget cuts. In 1991, Delaware paid 24 percent of UD's budget, compared to half that percentage today.\n\nIn 2011, Harker, a former dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, asked the General Assembly to give UD more flexibility to spend state funds. He also sounded the alarm on layoffs.\n\n\"We have to put everything on the table right now,\" Harker told legislators at the time. \"If someone retires, will we fill that position? That's something we have to think about.\"\n\nFour years later, UD eliminated Joseph Filippone's job and four others in the Facilities Planning and Construction department after the department merged with the university architect's office.\n\nHarker \"ran the university like a business,\" according to Filippone, who said he earned a $47,000 salary working as a computer design technician. After 14 years of service, Filippone received nearly $8,000 upon his exit, which consisted of one month's salary and one month's worth of unused vacation time.\n\nAnother former employee, who requested anonymity, said she lost her job in 2008, along with 10 others in her division over the next two years, after the university's publications department merged with the public relations office.\n\n\"Everybody just got to the point that they were keeping their head down and crossing their fingers that they weren't on the list,\" the employee said.\n\nThrough a Fed spokeswoman, Harker declined an interview for this story, referring all questions to UD. During his tenure in a tough economy, he increased student diversity, built new residence halls and laid the foundation for the STAR (Science, Technology & Research) Campus on the site of the former Newark Chrysler plant.\n\nIn 2014, in addition to receiving more than $950,000 in salary and benefits from UD and its affiliates, Harker earned more than $500,000 serving on the boards at chemicals group Huntsman Corp. and power utility Pepco Holdings Inc., according to a Bloomberg News report.\n\nBoyle, the university spokeswoman, said she could not discuss layoffs in individual departments. UD may merge operations to \"reduce redundancy\" and boost efficiency in an effort to \"keep tuition cost at a reasonable level for our students,\" she said. The university counted more than 4,300 employees last year, an eight percent increase from 2007, according to UD statistics.\n\nFull-time faculty members at UD receive salaries and benefits above the national average, according to data from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Full professors, for instance, earn about $149,000 a year, while instructor-level faculty earn $72,000. The AAUP did not include data from part-time faculty members, the largest segment of the academic labor force.\n\nUD surpasses the national average in another area: Tuition and fees. In-state students pay $13,160, not including room and board, according to College Board data. Out-of-state students pay $33,150.\n\nOver the past decade, in-state tuition and fees at UD have increased by 61 percent, which is in line with the national average. Out-of-state students, however, saw a 71 percent increase, significantly higher than the national average. More than 60 percent of undergraduates at the Newark campus come from out of state.\n\nLast month, UD announced \"Delaware First,\" the largest-ever fundraising campaign in the centuries-old institution's history.\n\nThe $750 million fund drive will support student scholarships, endowed professorships, graduate fellowships, a $60 million transformation of the Delaware Stadium and a new building to house UD's public policy school and the Biden Institute, a domestic research and policy think tank.\n\nIn announcing the campaign, Assanis said that while the university appreciates its state funding and tuition dollars, it needs more money to make a difference globally.\n\n\"This is all about taking the University of Delaware to the next level,\" he said.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nWhere the money flows:\n\nFederal tax records dating to 2007 show that UD has distributed more than $6 million in payments to top administrators who have left their posts. Here are the highest earners:\n\nDavid Roselle\n\nServed: President from May, 1990 to July, 2007\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.9 million\n\nDetails: Roselle's total compensation of about $875,000 in 2005 was the highest nationwide that year among public university presidents. The following year, his last full year at the helm, Roselle earned more than $2.45 million, the university's IRS forms show. He continued to receive annual compensation from UD through 2011. Roselle now serves as executive director of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDavid Hollowell\n\nServed: January, 1988 to December, 2007, most recently as executive vice president and treasurer.\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.1 million\n\nDetails: Hollowell earned nearly $651,000 in total compensation in 2006, which ballooned to more than $1.1 million during his final year. In 2008, when he was no longer employed by the university, he received nearly $1.1 million, according to IRS forms. He now serves as a commissioner and treasurer for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in Philadelphia, which is chaired by Goldey-Beacom College President Gary Wirt. Hollowell could not be reached for comment.\n\nK.C. Keeler\n\nServed: Head football coach from March, 2002 to January, 2013\n\nExit pay: Nearly $2 million\n\nDetails: Keeler, who earned more than $300,000 annually, was under contract with UD through 2017. He was fired in January 2013, but received nearly $2 million from the university that year, including a $1 million \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Now head football coach at Sam Houston State University, Keeler did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJennifer \"J.J.\" Davis\n\nServed: Vice president for finance and administration from November, 2008 to March, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $454,000\n\nDetails: Davis left UD in early March of 2013, but still received more than $563,000 in total compensation from the university for the 2013 calendar year, including a more than $454,000 \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Previously, Davis earned about $346,000 a year from UD. She now works as senior vice president for finance and administration for George Mason University in Virginia. Davis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMark Stalnecker\n\nServed: Chief investment officer from October, 1999 to July, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $107,000\n\nDetails: Stalnecker was among UD's highest-paid employees, earning nearly $367,000 in 2012, his last full year at the university. Stalnecker left midway through 2013 but still earned more than 80 percent of his 2012 compensation. Stalnecker earned a bonus of more than $107,000 that year \"for services rendered through the date of his retirement,\" according to UD's Form 990.\n\nPatrick Harker\n\nServed: President from July, 2007 to July, 2015\n\nExit pay: At least $400,000\n\nDetails: Harker stepped down from UD at the close of the 2014-15 academic year. During his final full year at the helm, he earned nearly $951,000, including nearly $144,000 in bonus compensation. In 2015, Harker earned nearly $817,000 from UD for working 55 hours a week, according to UD's Form 990 filed with the IRS, despite working for the university for only half the year.

Somewhere in the calculus that comes out the other end, we would have to figure that out.”\n\nFourth District councilman David Anderson said it would have to be a sweet deal in order for him to sign off on any plan to sell the utility.\n\n“I’m on board with the other nine ideas in the Vision 2020, but I am not in favor of selling the utility unless someone dangles enough money to make it feasible,” he said.\n\nSTORY: Trial opens in deadly Howard High assault\n\nSTORY: Bills could pave way for Dover Mall road\n\nJudy Diogo, president of the chamber, said the reason it made this a priority in its Vision 2020 initiative is because some members believe the city’s commercial rates are too high.\n\nShe said members first expressed some concern in 2009, which led to discussions with city leaders and workshops where Delaware Electric Cooperative presented an option for buying the utility from the city.\n\nDiogo said that initiative lost momentum until new concerns were voiced in recent years.\n\n“What we are trying to do is make Dover as economically viable so that the companies that are here and the businesses we are trying to attract here can be competitive in today’s market,” she said. “Our purpose is to try to move our recommendation forward to establish some type of a task force to assist the city in at least looking at the opportunity of what we can do with the utility.”\n\nDover Downs Hotel & Casino and Dover International Speedway, two of the city’s biggest users of electricity, went to the chamber with concerns about the rates and asked if there was a way they could be lowered.\n\nJanie Libby, vice president for human resources at the casino and speedway, said the energy consumption for Dover Downs and Dover International Speedway is enormous. Last year, she said the electric bill exceeded $2.1 million.\n\n“It’s no secret that the Dover electric rates are significantly higher than those of any of our neighbors, including the other two casinos with which we compete right here in Delaware,” Libby said. “We are extremely interested in anything we can do to reduce our expenses.”\n\nCurrently, the City of Dover is a member of the Delaware Municipal Electric Corporation, Inc. (DEMEC), a public corporation and a wholesale electric utility. DEMEC represents nine municipal electric distribution utilities in Delaware; its other members are Clayton, Middletown, Milford, Newark, New Castle, Seaford and Smyrna.\n\nActing City Manager Donna Mitchell confirmed that in the last rate study by the city, Dover consistently had lower residential rates than private companies. In some of its commercial rate plans, however, the city was not as competitive.\n\nThat is why she proposed the city pay for a study by an independent consultant to include best practices and possible areas for improvement, and an updated full cost-of-service study to include rate design and street lighting with recommendations on changes to the current components of the city’s electric rates.\n\n“Some of our issue is our reliance on the utility to help support the General Fund,” Mitchell said. “However, it would provide more transparency to our customers to have all of the cost drivers benchmarked.”\n\nThe Committee of the Whole thought the studies would benefit the city and voted to pass the recommendation on to the City Council for action. The lone dissenting vote came from Anderson.\n\nSeparate issues?\n\nCouncilman William Hare believes there is a lot more to the discussion than just rates. He said the generation side is a concern, especially when the plant doesn’t generate the majority of the electricity the city uses.\n\nThe city pays more than $6 million annually to operate the generating plant, which includes all personnel and operating expenses. Mitchell said much of the city’s power is a mix of purchased power, solar power and generated power. She said the city doesn’t run its generators unless called on to run.\n\nAs these generators – three natural gas-powered units at McKee and a black start jet engine at the VanSant facility at Schutte Park – get older, the cost to maintain them will increase.\n\n“We pay a very high price for someone to run that plant and I have never been a big advocate of that,” Hare said. “If we are going to be in the electric business, we need to be in the electric business and not pay somebody $7 million to run an operation for us when we have people who can do it.”\n\nSTORY: Dover crime, clearance rates climb in 2016\n\nJonathan B. Justice, a professor in the School of Public Policy & Administration at the University of Delaware, said he believes generation and distribution can be looked at separately when determining if selling to a third party is the right way to go. He said in principle, it is a pretty simple financial analysis.\n\n“If the plan is to sell off distribution as well as generation, I'd be surprised if that didn't eventually result in more expensive service to the city's customers, based on the likelihood that the greater cost of capital -- no tax-exempt bonding, plus the need to generate a profit for shareholders -- would outweigh any efficiency gains a private owner might enjoy,” he said, stressing that he has not specifically examined Dover's situation. “These are separate issues, and I would approach them that way.”\n\nHarry Maloney III, the director of electric engineering and construction for the city, said the city has time to decide.\n\n“We have a good utility. If this utility had terrible liability, the rates were through the roof, the infrastructure needed millions of dollars of improvements and the plant was falling apart, then is the time to look at other options,” Maloney said. “We don’t have that. The revenues are healthy. In March, you transferred $6 million into reserve accounts. You are healthy and doing well. We have a healthy utility and we have an opportunity here to start working on our rates and becoming more competitive.”\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.
