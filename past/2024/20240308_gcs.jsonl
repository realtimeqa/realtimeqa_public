Tuesday the South Korean record-breaking boy band snagged their second Grammy nomination and got an apology from \"Late Late Show\" host James Corden.\n\nThe \"Butter\" artists joined Corden in-studio for the late-night appearance, reuniting the talk show host and the band for the first time in two years. While exchanging pleasantries, RM (real name Kim Nam-joon) brought up the blow-back Corden has received from the bands devoted fans.\n\n\"You've been in some hot water with (the) ARMY,\" RM said. \"Are you all right?\"\n\nThe question caused Corden to fall over in embarrassment. \"We did two jokes, which I didn't think were in any way offensive to anybody, where we said that we thought it was unusual that you were kicking off the UN Summit with a performance,\" the host began, catching viewers up about material from a September show. \"We said – and this was where I think it was wrong – we said that your fans were 15-year-old girls, which, of course, isn't true, because I'm 43-years-old, and I consider myself to be one of the biggest BTS fans on planet Earth.\"\n\nBTS wins song of summer with 'Butter,' returns to No. 1 and enters Guinness' Hall of Fame\n\nJon Batiste leads 2022 Grammy nominations; Justin Bieber, Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish vie for big awards\n\nOn Sept. 20, Corden cracked to viewers the band's UN appearance marked \"the first time 15-year-old girls everywhere found themselves wishing that they were (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres.\"\n\nFollowing the remark, \"Late Late Show\" bandleader Reggie Watts was the first to alert Corden to the uproar. The talk show host recalled Tuesday telling Watts someone had wished him dead.\n\n\"I was like, 'Well, someone's just told me that they hope I die today,' which did feel extreme,\" said Corden. \"It did feel extreme in response to what I thought were two quite harmless jokes, which we never wanted to be at anyone's expense. Because – I hope you know this – we absolutely love you, and we love the entire ARMY. We do!\"\n\nHe added: \"The prospect of doing anything that may have upset them – I didn't enjoy that feeling, and I hope they know that we would never do anything that would upset (them).\"\n\nRM was quick to forgive. \"James, it's all right,\" he said, extending his hand. \"We appreciate your apology.

Three months later, the Grammy-winning singer was accused of hitting a woman during an argument at a Los Angeles residence, according to multiple media reports.\n\nFor more than a decade, Brown has been repeatedly accused of violence against women. The most high-profile incident involved his former girlfriend Rihanna, who became a poster child for domestic abuse after Brown assaulted her the night before the 2009 Grammys and a photo of her face was leaked to TMZ. Brown pleaded guilty to a felony assault charge.\n\nIn 2017, Brown’s ex-girlfriend, actress Karrueche Tran, obtained a restraining order against him after she said he threatened her with violence. In 2016, a woman accused Brown of threatening her with a gun inside his house, though he was not convicted. Brown has also been accused of assaulting a woman at a club and at a party. In 2019, Brown was accused of raping a woman in Paris. He was released without charges.\n\nBrown's reps have yet to comment on the latest accusations against him.\n\nBefore Brown assaulted Rihanna, he was one of the hottest acts in music with a string of hits on the Billboard Hot 100. While public sentiment turned on him immediately following the assault, he has maintained a fan base and continued to sell records. The repeated accusations against Brown suggest he has not reckoned with his abusive behavior. His continued success suggests neither has the public.\n\n“Abuse is an intentional pattern of behavior intended to help one person gain and maintain power and control over another person — whether that’s a partner, a friend or family member, a stranger, or even a celebrity,\" said Deborah Vagins, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence. \"An abusive person is the only person responsible for their actions. It’s their decision to perpetrate abuse in the first place, and it’s their decision whether they ultimately want to change their behavior and stop the abuse. But society can hold them accountable and we can choose how we respond to them and decide whether they reflect the kind of public figure we want to support with our time, energy and money.\"\n\nBrown's most ardent fans – dubbed \"Team Breezy\" – have consistently defended him and suggest he's the target of racial profiling. Brown has occasionally used social media to defend himself. After a woman said Brown threatened her with a gun, he took to Instagram to lambaste the police, claiming \"every three months y'all come up with something.\" He also responded to the rape allegation on Instagram calling it \"false\" and against his \"character and morals.\"\n\nMore than half of U.S. women have been physically assaulted in their lifetime, according to the Justice Department, and one in 3 women has experienced intimate partner violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 1 in 5 women in the U.S. has experienced a completed or attempted rape, according to the CDC. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 75% of violent incidents involve male offenders.\n\nBrown's initial sentence 'did not hold him accountable'\n\nAfter Brown assaulted Rihanna, he was sentenced to five years probation and 1,400 hours of community service.\n\nRuth Glenn, president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said the sentence was too light to communicate the gravity of Brown's actions.\n\n\"God knows what Rihanna experienced in the weeks and months leading up to that, the emotional abuse as well, but the physical violence alone should have resulted in a much stronger sentence, which may have helped him understand the severity of what he had done and that society would not accept it,\" she said.\n\nWhile Glenn says the U.S. lacks a model for rehabilitating perpetrators, and there is debate around whether rehabilitation is even possible, she notes if a perpetrator has any hope of changing behavior, they need to contemplate what they've done.\n\n\"He needs time to be held accountable in ways where he can reflect and make personal behavior changes,\" Glenn said. \"It's certainly not going to happen during probation, and particularly for someone who we saw was as violent as Chris Brown.\"\n\nVagins said an abusive person must be truly committed to acknowledging the harm they’ve caused in order to change.\n\n\"It’s an intentional, lifelong process to unlearn the behaviors, mindsets, and values that allow someone to normalize their own violence toward someone else,\" Vagins said.\n\nBrown's exposure to domestic violence as a child and the role it played\n\nWhen Brown issued a public apology after assaulting Rihanna, he disclosed that he \"grew up in a home where there was domestic violence and I saw first-hand what uncontrolled rage can do.\"\n\nMore than 15 million children in the United States live in homes in which domestic violence has occurred, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which notes these children are at greater risk for \"repeating the cycle as adults by entering into abusive relationships or becoming abusers themselves.\"\n\nWhile she doesn't deny the connection, Glenn said using childhood trauma as a defense for perpetrating abuse is a slippery slope.\n\n\"I would challenge us to think about where our history and cultural experiences stop and where personal responsibility begins,\" she said. \"I know many wonderful men who grew up with violence in their homes and never harmed a woman.\"\n\nGlenn said men perpetrating violence must focus on their present-day choices and first stop committing violence before they can work backwards to explore causes.\n\nWhat supporting Chris Brown costs victims and the public\n\nBrown's continued success despite the accusations against him sends the message to women and abuse survivors that society still does not value their health or their lives.\n\n\"We're still second class citizens, we still live in a society that believes our lives don't matter as much as the lives of the men who harm us,\" Glenn said.\n\nAnalysis:The #MeToo survivors we forgot\n\n'Why didn't you leave?':This question is part of the problem\n\nTo minimize violence perpetrated by men such as Brown, society must continue to raise awareness about the power dynamics present in these forms of abuse, to continue to examine the root causes of violence against women and to give voice to the millions of women who have survived it.\n\n\"(We urge) the public to center the experiences and needs of the people that Chris Brown has harmed,\" Vagins said, \"and to support their requests for safety, accountability and justice.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/21/here-all-prominent-men-have-been-accused-sexual-misconduct-since-harvey-weinstein/881595001/", "title": "A list of celebrities accused of sexual assault since Harvey Weinstein", "text": "Since The New York Times published a harrowing, detailed report that uncovered three decades of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, women and men have accused other men in Hollywood and beyond of the same type of misconduct.\n\nHere is a list of all of the celebrities and prominent figures who have been accused of sexual misconduct since the Times' Weinstein story broke on Oct. 5, 2017. The list will be continuously updated if or when more are accused of misbehavior.\n\n►How Twitter reacted:'Today' host Matt Lauer fired over sexual misconduct claims\n\nMatt Lauer\n\nLongtime \"Today\" host Matt Lauer was fired by NBC over what it called \"inappropriate workplace behavior.\" NBC said it was the first complaint lodged against Lauer, but that “we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated” incident.\n\nVariety published the first account of Lauer's behavior. The magazine said Lauer once gave a colleague a sex toy as a present, reprimanded an employee after she refused to engage in a sexual act and often quizzed female producers about who they have slept with. He was also known for making lewd comments verbally or over text message, the magazine said.\n\nLauer is one of several high-profile journalists to be ousted recently, after accusations of sexual harassment in recent weeks, including Charlie Rose, who was dropped by CBS and PBS, after a Washington Post report that detailed years of alleged sexual misconduct with several women. Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes, formerly of Fox News, also have faced allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nGarrison Keillor\n\nGarrison Keillor, the former host of “A Prairie Home Companion,” said he had been fired by Minnesota Public Radio over allegations of improper behavior. Keillor told The Associated Press of his firing in an email, but he didn’t give more details of the allegation other than to say it was over “a story that I think is more interesting and more complicated than the version MPR heard.” Keillor retired last year from his longtime radio show, but he still produced The Writer’s Almanac for syndication.\n\nKevin Spacey\n\nAt least 15 people have accused actor Kevin Spacey of sexual misconduct since the Weinstein story broke, five of whom said they were teens at the time. Most notably, Anthony Rapp, an actor on \"Star Trek: Discovery,\" told Buzzfeed that Spacey made sexual advances towards him when he was 14.

His future on the show is in doubt.\n\nMario Batali\n\nThe chef, who co-hosted \"The Chew\" and owns B&B Hospitality Group, has had multiple accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate touching. Several women have claimed he groped their breasts or buttocks, as well as other allegations.

The Post also reported that he pursued relationships with other teens. The New Yorker reported that Moore had been banned from an Alabama mall because of his predatory behavior towards young girls, though the mall, according to Snopes, doesn't have records that date back that far. Moore has denied all of the allegations against him. Election day in Alabama is Dec. 12, 2017.\n\nJameis Winston\n\nBuzzfeed reported Nov. 17, 2017, that Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston is being investigated by the NFL for allegedly groping a female Uber driver in Arizona in 2016. Winston has denied the allegation, saying the accuser was confused about the number of people present in the car when the alleged incident took place. The league's investigation into Winston will not be complete by the end of the 2017-2018 season, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nWinston was also accused of rape in 2012 as a student at Florida State University. No charges were ever filed, but he settled a civil lawsuit with his accuser.\n\nAndy Dick\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter reported that Andy Dick was fired from a movie after being accused of sexual harassment and misconduct on set. His behavior included groping people's genitals, unwanted kissing and/or licking and sexual propositions, according to the Reporter. Dick denied he groped anyone, but admitted he may have kissed and licked people.\n\nLouis C.K.\n\nThe comedian has admitted to allegations reported by The New York Times that he masturbated in front of multiple women without their consent. Before the story came out, his movie \"I Love You, Daddy\" and an appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" were canceled.\n\nJames Toback\n\nToback has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than 200 women, with the Los Angeles Times doing the brunt of that reporting.

Doctors who attempted to help patients conceive through in-vitro fertilization, a fertility treatment used by millions of Americans, could also be locked up for destroying embryos, and certain contraception such as Plan B would be banned.\n\n“The taking of a life is murder, and it is illegal,” state Rep. Danny McCormick told a committee of state lawmakers who considered the bill in May, right after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\n\n“No compromises, no more waiting,” Brian Gunter, the pastor who suggested McCormick be the one to introduce the legislation, told the committee.\n\nLouisiana State Rep. Danny McCormick, pastor Brian Gunter and attorney Bradley Pierce (right to left) urged state lawmakers to move their bill, HB 813, out of committee earlier this year. Louisiana House of Representatives\n\nOnly four people spoke against the bill during the committee meeting— all women. They pleaded with the lawmakers to grasp the gravity of the proposed restrictions, which went farther than any state abortion law currently on the books, and warned of unintended consequences.\n\n“We need to take a deep breath,” said Melissa Flournoy, a former state representative who runs the progressive advocacy group 10,000 Women Louisiana. She said the bill would only punish women and that there wasn’t enough responsibility being placed on men.\n\nBut in the end, only one man and one woman, an Independent and a Democrat, voted against it in committee. Seven men on the committee, all Republicans, voted in favor of the bill, moving it one step closer to becoming law.\n\nMen at the helm\n\nA faction of self-proclaimed “abolitionists” are seeking to make abortion laws more restrictive and the consequences of having the procedure more punitive than ever before.\n\nEmboldened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they say they will not be satisfied until fetuses are given the same protections as all US citizens — meaning that if abortion is illegal, then criminal statutes should be applied accordingly. While major national anti-abortion groups say they do not support criminalizing women, the idea is gaining traction with certain conservative lawmakers. And the activists and politicians leading the charge are nearly always men, CNN found.\n\nThis year, three male lawmakers from Indiana attempted to wipe out existing abortion regulations and change the state’s criminal statutes to apply at the time of fertilization. In Texas, five male lawmakers authored a bill last year that would have made getting an abortion punishable by the death penalty if it had gone into law. A state representative in Arizona introduced legislation that included homicide charges — saying in a Facebook video that anyone who undergoes an abortion deserves to “spend some time” in the Arizona “penal system.” And a male Kansas lawmaker proposed a bill that would amend the state’s constitution to allow abortion laws to pass without an exception for the life of the mother.\n\nWhile most in the anti-abortion movement believe that human life begins at conception, “abolitionists” are particularly uncompromising in how they act on their beliefs — comparing abortion to the Holocaust and using inflammatory terms such as “slaughter” and “murder” to describe a medical procedure that most Americans believe should be legal in all or most cases.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Why a woman's doctor warned her not to get pregnant in Texas 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nBradley Pierce, the attorney who helped draft the Louisiana bill, said his organization has been involved with many of the “abolition” bills that have been introduced in more than a dozen states. All of this proposed legislation would make it possible for women seeking abortions to face criminal charges.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Americans said in a Pew Research Center poll they don’t believe men should have a greater say on abortion policy, but that is what is happening. Experts told CNN that the male dominance fits within the anti-abortion movement’s current framing as being focused on “fetal personhood” and “fetal rights” as opposed to maternal rights.\n\nEric Swank, an Arizona State University professor who has studied gender differences in anti-abortion activists, said his research found that while men aren’t necessarily more likely to consider themselves to be “pro-life” than women, they “are more willing to take the adamant stance of no abortion under any conditions.”\n\nThe most restrictive bills, which don’t include explicit “life of the mother” exceptions and would charge those who receive abortions with homicide, have failed to make it to the full vote needed for passage. But others that prohibit abortions even in cases of rape and incest have taken hold in around a dozen states, including Missouri, Alabama and Tennessee, according to Guttmacher Institute.\n\nThose laws, CNN found, were also overwhelmingly passed into law by male legislators. While female Republicans almost always voted in favor of the legislation, gender imbalances within state legislatures, as well as the fact that female lawmakers were more likely to be Democrats, fueled the voting gap. And male Democratic lawmakers were far more likely than female Democrats to cross the aisle to vote in favor of the abortion bans, according to CNN’s analysis.\n\nThe Texas Heartbeat Act, for example, outlawed nearly all abortions in the state when it criminalized the procedure as soon as a heartbeat could be detected — as early as six weeks of pregnancy. While men made up nearly three quarters of the 177 lawmakers who voted, nearly 90% of those who voted in favor of the bill were men.\n\nEncouraging ‘sacrificial behavior’\n\nScott Herndon, a bearded Idaho man and father of eight, once believed abortion was an issue that should be discussed “between a woman and her physician.”\n\nHe remembers watching the classic 80s movie, “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” and being relatively ambivalent about the fact that one of the characters received an abortion. He didn’t become a Christian until 1996, the same year he drove his pregnant girlfriend along the streets of San Francisco on his motorcycle. The pregnancy was unexpected, but that life development, along with a newfound religious practice, led Herndon to spend a lot of thinking about “the miraculous nature of life.” Over the years he began to feel compelled to get involved with the anti-abortion movement.\n\nHis daughter is now 25, and he and his wife went on to have seven more children. A longtime member of the Idaho Republicans, he told CNN he decided to run for state Senate this year with a mission of fighting government encroachment. Herndon, who touts his competitive shooting experience in high school and college, is a staunch supporter of the right to bear arms and strongly opposes vaccine mandates. He describes himself as a “true family-values conservative,” noting that his sons help him with his home-building business while his five daughters live on the family farm, milking cows, and raising chickens and pigs.\n\nOne of his longterm goals if elected, he said, is to abolish abortion in the state.\n\n“Success depends on changing hearts and minds,” he said. “I liken the effort to Martin Luther King Jr.’s civil rights movement for desegregation and equal treatment of African Americans.”\n\nThis comparison is one that abortion rights activists take serious issue with. “Let’s be clear: appropriating the word ‘abolition’ is particularly contemptuous,” a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement to CNN. “That word is a symbol of freedom and this group wants to put people behind bars for exercising their right to bodily autonomy.”\n\nAbortion rights demonstrators gathered outside the US Supreme Court after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nHerndon, however, says women should embrace their instinctual “sacrificial behavior.”\n\n“If a mother is in a life raft with a child and there’s only enough food and water to save one, I’m guessing most mothers would not throw their child overboard and drown them,” he said in an interview with CNN when asked about medical circumstances where a doctor may deem an abortion necessary to save a woman’s life, such as a cancer diagnosis that requires aggressive treatment.\n\nAs part of their efforts to abolish abortion, which is generally defined as the termination of a pregnancy, Herndon and others in the anti-abortion movement are attempting to redefine the term to the “intentional killing” of a fetus.\n\nThat way, they claim, the lives of mothers could still be saved as long as doctors make an equal attempt to save the fetus.\n\nGunter, meanwhile, said he disagrees with the medical establishment and does not believe abortion is ever medically necessary.\n\nDoctors point to a variety of medical situations where an abortion may be needed to protect a pregnant person's life. Rebecca Blackwell/AP\n\nMedical and legal experts told CNN this is a dangerous and inaccurate claim, saying there are plenty of situations that could result in women dying or being put through unnecessary bodily harm if explicit exceptions for the health and life of the mother are not included in the laws regulating abortion.\n\nLouise King, a gynecologic surgeon and professor at Harvard Medical School, said the claims are “disingenuous at best and intentional dissemination of misinformation at worst” and questioned why they “can’t simply trust medical professionals to do their job.”\n\n“Most of these ‘arguments’ are attempts to impose a minority religious view on the majority of our citizens,” she said. “This is not a matter of belief or opinion. This is a highly inappropriate way to use our legislative system.”\n\nAn immediate abortion may be needed if a pregnant person’s water breaks before 20 weeks, King said, or when patients have pre-existing conditions that could lead to heart or liver failure or they need aggressive treatment for a disease like cancer that would severely harm — if not destroy — the fetus. An “equal attempt to save the fetus” would require putting the life of the pregnant person at risk,” she said, adding that it is also not the well established standard of care.\n\nDoctors also note that abortion bans take away a patient’s ability to make decisions about their own health and pregnancy, sometimes forcing them to endure pregnancies and deliveries of fetuses that will not survive.\n\nStories like this are already making headlines as laws become increasingly restrictive. In some cases, doctors are already afraid to perform abortions in cases where a mother’s health is at risk, even with so called “life of the mother” exceptions in place. In Texas, one woman learned that her baby had heart, lung, brain, kidney and genetic defects and would either be stillborn or die within minutes of birth. At the same time, doctors warned her that carrying the baby to term threatened her own life, but she says she was still refused an abortion by doctors who said it could run afoul of the state’s strict six-week abortion ban. She ultimately drove 10 hours to a New Mexico abortion clinic to undergo the procedure. “I’m still so angry and hurt about it that I can hardly see straight,” she wrote on Facebook the next day.\n\nAnother Texas woman spoke out about being forced to carry her dead fetus for weeks after suffering a miscarriage. In Louisiana, a woman carrying a fetus without a skull was reportedly not allowed to get an abortion, while another was reportedly denied an abortion and instead forced into hours of labor when her water broke at 16 weeks, long before the fetus was viable.\n\nIdaho State Senate candidate Scott Herndon supports a total abortion ban in the state. Brook Joyner/CNN\n\nHerndon agreed that the health of the pregnant woman should be considered, but he worries that the medical community automatically prioritizes the mother’s life and does not treat the fetus as a person until birth, saying this needs to change. And he said that while locking up women is not his objective, it only makes sense for homicide charges to apply to a woman who chooses to undergo an abortion if fetuses are given equal protections under the law.\n\nAs chair of his county’s Republican Party, he attended the Idaho Republican convention in July and proposed an official change to the party platform in support of an amendment to the state constitution that would “strengthen” the rights of fetuses.\n\nAfter it easily passed the vote, a fellow Republican delegate took the floor with a proposal that was not met with the same support. She wanted to make sure an exception was included in the party platform for abortions needed for a woman’s physical and mental health, Herndon recounted.\n\nA heated debate ensued, with Herndon describing the proposal as not carefully crafted and unnecessary. The proposal was ultimately rejected by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, according to news reports. The Idaho Republican Party did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNo exceptions\n\nBack in 2019, a bill that would criminalize abortion even in cases of rape and incest was placed in front of Alabama’s legislature — a move so extreme that a number of high-profile Republicans initially said it went too far.\n\nWhen the bill reached the state Senate, 25 male legislators voted on party lines to enact it, and the state’s female governor signed it into law.\n\nA federal judge blocked it from taking effect, but it had an immediate domino effect as other states followed suit. Most of the laws, including near-total abortion bans known as “trigger” laws and six-week “heartbeat” bills, weren’t able to take effect at the time either, but they are being implemented across the country now that Roe v. Wade has been overturned.\n\nThis wave of unprecedented restrictions shows the power of the anti-abortion movement and how the Republican Party has shifted to appeal to a small but fervent group of voters, experts said.\n\n“The idea that a fully human life with full moral worth begins at conception is not an extreme view in the pro-life movement,” said Ziad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who has researched the movements on both sides of the abortion debate. “The real issue is the degree of power the movement has over the Republican Party in the political arena, where such viewpoints have – at least until recently – been outside the mainstream.”\n\nAnti-abortion protesters gathered at the Indiana State Capitol this summer. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nAnd in recent years, a particular brand of Republican candidate has become more prominent — one that touts the “Big Lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, doesn’t trust science and consider themselves to be Christian Nationalists, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.\n\n“Even a more moderate candidate may feel that they have to toe the line in what the anti-abortion movement is saying, and what (the movement) wants is changing,” said Ziegler, who has studied the anti-abortion movement’s influence on US politics. “So who you are catering to if you’re the Republican Party is changing.”\n\nAs a result, she said, what would have previously been considered a disqualifying stance on abortion for most voters is one of the issues now being used by a growing number of Republican candidates for state and federal office in the hopes of securing their party’s nomination.\n\nDuring the primary season earlier this year, two of the leading Republican candidates for governor of Pennsylvania said in a debate that they support banning abortion under any circumstances, including if the mother’s life is at risk. “I don’t give way to exceptions,” said Doug Mastriano, who will be on the ticket in November to succeed incumbent Democratic governor Tom Wolf, who has vetoed a number of abortion bans passed by the Republican-controlled state legislature.\n\nMen running for a number of statewide offices in Georgia have also vocalized their support of total abortion bans. “There’s no exception in my mind,” former football star Herschel Walker, a Republican who is running for the US Senate, told reporters.\n\nMastriano and Walker have not expressed support for prosecuting women who have abortions. They did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nWhile an overwhelming majority of Americans support legalized abortion when a woman’s life or health is at risk, Ziegler said the disappearing “life of the mother” exception stems from a deep distrust of both women, science and the medical establishment. The new focus on punishing women for undergoing abortions — as seen in several bills recently proposed — is also only likely to intensify, she said. As abortion providers close up shop in states with bans, it is going to become increasingly difficult to charge doctors if women travel to other states for the procedure.\n\n“That’s going to make it more appealing to punish women,” Ziegler said.\n\n‘Abolitionist, not pro-life’\n\nFor pastor Gunter in Lousiana, the “pro-life establishment” is not taking a hard enough stand against abortion.\n\nHe told CNN he doesn’t think someone can be truly “pro-life” while also believing that abortion is acceptable in certain circumstances. He said he will support nothing short of an all-out abortion ban with homicide charges and that unlike some of his peers, he refuses to sacrifice his principles for political reasons.\n\nGunter, who “grew up in church in diapers” and is now in his 30s, said in a recent speech that he once believed that opposing abortion simply meant voting for “pro-life” candidates. But when a seminary professor invited him and other men to spread the gospel outside an abortion clinic in 2008, he said everything changed.\n\nPastor Brian Gunter said he approached Rep. Danny McCormick about the Louisiana bill that included homicide charges for women who receive abortions. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThat day, he said he watched 15 women go inside the clinic and “murder their children.” One of them, Gunter said, couldn’t have been older than 13 and he believed she was being forced to undergo the procedure by her mother.\n\n“She’s a child, and her mother pulled her into that clinic,” said Gunter. “That day changed my life. I went home, and I was newly married… (my wife) was pregnant with our first child. I’d been seeing ultrasound pictures of my son and I thought to myself ‘My God, someone killed a child just like my son, same age as my son, looks like my son. How can they do that?”\n\nAfter that, he says he began confronting women as they entered abortion clinics every week. And in an attempt to create more sweeping change, he decided to get involved politically. He said he approached Rep. McCormick, who did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment, earlier this year about the Louisiana bill that ended up making waves across the country. It even sparked outrage from the largest anti-abortion group in the state — one that Gunter said he had worked for but recently parted ways with because he felt it wasn’t doing enough to outlaw abortion.\n\nGunter’s impassioned plea at the committee hearing in May was met with applause, and the vote in favor of moving the bill to the full House ultimately came down to a group of state lawmakers that included a former law enforcement officer, a criminal defense and personal injury attorney and an entrepreneur who makes a living designing “man caves” and selling game room furniture.\n\nAnti-abortion \"abolitionists\" gathered at the Louisiana State Capitol in support of a bill that would charge pregnant people who receive abortions with murder. Chris Graythen/Getty Images/File\n\nLawmakers then gathered on the House floor to debate the bill while dozens of supporters gathered outside the chambers in what resembled a church service, reciting Bible passages and swaying together while singing hymns such as “Amazing Grace.” Jeff Durbin, an Arizona-based pastor and head of a Christian production company Apologia Studios, which has more than 300,000 subscribers on YouTube, emceed and live-streamed the event. Durbin, who once played Michelangelo and Donatello in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise and became fervently religious after overdosing on ecstasy, is now “unapologetically seeking to criminalize and eliminate all forms of abortion without exception.” He did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHe and five other men addressed the crowd at the state capitol, citing proverbs and describing women who get abortions as murderers.\n\n“We have… a righteous bill that punishes those who choose to murder their children,” T. Russell Hunter, the founder of anti-abortion group Free the States, yelled into the microphone, saying that any truly “pro-life” law should hold pregnant women accountable for their decisions — not just the medical providers. “Abortionists do not wake up and go out into the culture looking for children to kill; mothers bring their babies to them to be murdered. They are guilty…they have murdered their children under the color of law and the Lord God hates it.”\n\nHunter’s group describes itself as “abolitionist, not pro-life” — echoing Gunter’s argument that many in the movement are compromising on their values. “While many who call themselves pro-life agree with us that abortion is murder,” Free the States writes on its website, “abortion has not been opposed by the pro-life political establishment in a manner consistent with its being murder.” Hunter told CNN this movement is not “about wanting to punish women or something silly like that,” and that anyone involved in the decision to terminate a pregnancy should face criminal charges — including fathers.\n\n“Pray for the legislators here,” Durbin, who also runs End Abortion Now, said at the capitol rally.\n\nBut this time, the prayers went unfulfilled.\n\nInside the House chamber, one of seven men to initially vote in favor of the proposed legislation, Rep. Alan Seabaugh, a Republican who describes himself as “pro-life,” apologized for his vote. He said he believed the bill was unconstitutional, “makes criminals out of women.” Other Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocates in the state also came out hard against the bill, saying it went too far — including a state representative who said her grandson wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for in vitro fertilization (IVF).\n\nThe bill never went to a full vote.\n\nIt was the first time such an extreme anti-abortion measure made it out of any state committee, however, and the vocal opposition has not deterred Gunter. He plans to work with McCormick, the Louisiana lawmaker, to introduce a similar bill next year.\n\nMomentum, he told CNN, is only building in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent decision.\n\nWhat should we investigate next?

The GOP and gas ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn 2019, the city council in Berkeley, California, held a stunning vote: it would ban natural gas hookups in all new building construction to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the city’s impact on the climate crisis.\n\nNo gas furnaces in new homes, the council said. No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law. It’s meant a lot of active outreach to local developers building in Flagstaff, encouraging them to build all-electric housing developments. It’s also reaching out to residents whose gas appliances are at the end of their lifecycles to consider buying electric.\n\n“Our challenge here is we have a 2030 deadline” to get to net-zero, Antonopoulos told CNN. “The urgency is so great so sometimes we don’t have that luxury in time.”\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct that Mejia Cunningham was speaking on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/politics/louisiana-abortion-ban-trigger-law/index.html", "title": "Louisiana governor signs bill to strengthen potential abortion ban if ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLouisiana’s Democratic governor has signed a bill that will toughen an abortion ban that is ready to be implemented in the event that the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe so-called “trigger law” allows for more exceptions to the 2006 version of the state’s abortion ban, but still does not make an exception for a pregnancy that is the result of rape or incest, and would impose harsher criminal penalties to anyone who performs an abortion.\n\nIn an announcement, Gov. John Bel Edwards said that although he objected to the lack of exceptions, he signed the bill anyway.\n\n“I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact,” Edwards, a rare Democrat who opposes abortion rights, said in a signing statement dated Saturday. “This does not belie my belief that there should be an exception to the prohibition on abortion for victims of rape and incest.”\n\nHe argued that vetoing the bill would “not accomplish that end” and would leave in place even more restrictions than the ones outlined in the new legislation.\n\nThe new law allows for legal abortion in the case of an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus and cannot survive. It also allows an exception for any pregnancy in which two doctors conclude that the fetus would not be able to survive after birth.\n\nAdditionally, the law permits the use of emergency contraception – also known as “morning-after” pills – that can be taken shortly after sex to prevent pregnancy.\n\nSenate Bill 342 has harsher penalties for anyone who “commits the crime of abortion,” imposing up to 10 years imprisonment and $100,000 in fines. Under the new law, a physician who performs a late term abortion, which is defined as when the gestational age of the fetus is 15 weeks or more, is subject to up to 15 years in prison and fined up to $200,000.\n\nThe law directs the closure of abortion facilities if Roe v. Wade is overturned and abortion is prohibited in the state. It blocks localities from enacting ordinances that are less stringent than the state’s abortion laws, but allows for localities to enact ordinances stricter than state laws.\n\nThe law also ensures that the state’s abortion laws are “severable in nature just in case one is ruled unconstitutional at any time,” the bill’s main sponsor, Democratic state Sen. Katrina Jackson, said during a committee hearing last month.\n\nThe goal of SB 342, according to Louisiana National Right to Life, is to make sure that the “trigger law” isn’t interpreted in court to be precluded by other abortion bills that have been passed after 2006.\n\nThe White House earlier this month lambasted the Louisiana state legislature for passing the bill, calling it “extreme” and “the latest step in a growing attack against the fundamental freedoms of Americans.”\n\nLouisiana and several Republican-led states have enacted legislation in anticipation that the Supreme Court’s conservative majority will overturn Roe v. Wade and leave it up to states to regulate abortion.\n\nA leaked draft opinion reported in May by Politico for the Supreme Court case Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization showed Roe v. Wade struck down. The court’s final decision is expected this month.\n\nLast week, Edwards also signed a bill into law that bans the sale or distribution of drugs used in a medication abortion without a prescription and creates criminal penalties for doing so. The bipartisan bill also blocks drugs used in medication abortions to be delivered to Louisianians via mail. Under the bill, women would not be subject to criminal penalties for having or taking the drugs.\n\nThe bill would not apply to “contraceptive drugs or devices, Plan B or the morning-after pill,” or “other emergency contraception.” The law goes into effect on August 1.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Andy Rose", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Andy Rose"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/us/everytown-weak-gun-laws-high-gun-deaths-study/index.html", "title": "States with weaker gun laws have higher rates of firearm related ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA study published in January by a leading non-profit organization that focuses on gun violence prevention found that there is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings.\n\nThe study by Everytown for Gun Safety determined that California had the strongest gun laws in the country. Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n“What this project does, is show what we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save lives,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. “We think this is going to be a really important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make that case clearly.”\n\nThe findings of the study have come into sharp focus following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials told CNN that the gunman legally purchased two assault rifles for his 18th birthday.\n\nTexas has steadily loosened restrictions on gun ownership over the past several years. Last September, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. Texas is ranked 34 out of 50 states in Everytown’s gun law strength ranking.\n\nTo compile its list, the group used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50 policies that they say are scientifically proven to be effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.\n\nThe research team then weighed the list of gun safety policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its implementation of those policies and compared that score with the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.\n\nThe CDC’s data includes homicides, accidental killings and suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 people in the United States were killed with a firearm in 2020 – more than half died by suicide.\n\nThe analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the top of the list for gun law strength – a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, with a low rate of 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 residents, and below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with firearms in 9% of households, the data shows.\n\nFew gun control laws passed as 2022 sessions wrap\n\nAs state legislatures wrap up their 2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across various states.\n\n“I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and effective,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Gun laws work, and we need them across the board to ensure that felons, domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can’t simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws meant to keep guns out of their hands.”\n\nCNN reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) to comment on the research before it was first published in January, but it declined to do so before seeing the data.\n\nMississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out of 100 and has a rate of 28.6 gun deaths per 100,000 residents – the highest of all states, the research shows.\n\nMassachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the second-lowest rate of gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.\n\n“Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can’t pretend to be ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at this report,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six educators.\n\nMother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is “tearing our community apart.”\n\nNearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre “Dre” Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic paralysis.\n\n“As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that was taken away,” Dycus said. “My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.”\n\n“But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it pertains to what it looks like to survive,” she said. “Dre has embodied that.”\n\nMembers of Moms Demand Action protest in Texas on Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Austin, Texas, after Gov.

These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that temporarily remove a person’s access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states – including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming – passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan. Four students were killed on November 30, when student Ethan Crumbley allegedly opened fire. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial “constitutional carry” legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an “artificial barrier” to residents’ right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to “the protection of themselves or their families” in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n“As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we’ve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials’ homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,” Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a “textbook example” of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year’s legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown’s research shows that 21 of the country’s states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded. There is no federal database of gun sales, but other independent surveys have found that gun sales have soared during the Covid-19 pandemic.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker Priya Krishnakumar", "Emma Tucker", "Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/01/politics/florida-red-flag-law/index.html", "title": "Florida's red flag law, championed by Republicans, is taking guns ...", "text": "Tampa, Florida CNN —\n\nTwice a week from her courtroom, Florida 13th Circuit Court Judge Denise Pomponio decides who in Hillsborough County can no longer be trusted with a gun.\n\nIn just the last two months, she has taken away the firearm privileges of dozens of people, including a dad accused of threatening to “shoot everyone” at his son’s school, a woman who police say attempted suicide and then accidentally shot her boyfriend during a struggle for her revolver, a husband who allegedly fired multiple rounds in the street to “blow off steam” after losing a family member, a bullied 13-year-old witnesses overheard saying, “If all of 8th grade is missing tomorrow you will know why,” and a mother arrested for brandishing a handgun at another mom after a school bus incident between their daughters.\n\nThis is Florida’s “red flag” law in action. Passed in the wake of the horrific 2018 mass shooting at a Parkland high school, the state law provides police a path to ask a judge to temporarily bar dangerous individuals from possessing or purchasing a firearm. Since its creation, Florida judges have acted more than 8,000 times to keep guns out of the hands of people authorities deemed a risk to themselves or others, according to data maintained by the Office of the State Courts Administrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pomponio added another one to the list: A man accused of pointing two guns at his stepfather.\n\n“He was enjoying the whole thing,” the stepfather told the courtroom. His stepson’s wife even filmed the encounter, he said. “He said he wanted to eff me up.” One of the guns was later found in the bed of the stepson’s 11-year-old brother, a sheriff’s deputy told the courtroom.\n\nIn the aftermath of recent massacres in Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, those looking to change the country’s gun laws see in Florida a blueprint to move forward – not only because leaders moved to restrict firearms, but because it emerged out of a Republican stronghold unofficially known as the “Gunshine State.”\n\n“The Florida law is a good law, and it’s a signal of what’s possible,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, one of the most vocal advocates in Congress for gun control, said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”\n\nIn Florida, a red flag policy, also known as risk protection orders, was one piece of a sprawling gun reform package that then-Gov. Rick Scott signed into law just three weeks after a teenage gunman killed 17 people inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It included $400 million in new spending for priorities like school security and mental health resources, and allowed trained school staff to carry firearms for the first time. Republican lawmakers also agreed to raise the age to own a gun to 21 and implemented a three-day waiting period to purchase most rifles.\n\n“I knew the time for thoughts and prayers, although necessary, was not enough,” said Bill Galvano, a Republican and the former state senator who sponsored the legislation.\n\nGalvano told CNN he began drafting the bill at his kitchen table after a tour of the carnage in Parkland. He incorporated ideas he had picked up from interviewing teachers and staff at the school. He was intent on including some gun safety reforms and focused on what he thought could pass. He was still learning how red flag laws worked when it was added to the draft.\n\nLooking at the data on the people who had guns taken away in Florida, Galvano says, “You have to believe that makes a difference.”\n\nResearch suggests red flags have made a difference where they’ve been implemented. One analysis of Connecticut’s red flag law, in place since 1999, found that for every 10 to 20 guns removed by a risk protection order led to one averted suicide. Another study found intimate partner homicides dropped in states where authorities can prohibit people convicted of “nonspecific violent misdemeanors” from possessing firearms.\n\nThe National Rifle Association and its Florida lobbyist, Marion Hammer, fiercely opposed the 2018 gun safety legislation. The organization’s influential scorecards loomed over the head of most Republican lawmakers. Hammer, a towering figure in Florida politics for decades, called GOP supporters “turncoat Republicans” and the organization urged its members to pressure lawmakers into abandoning the legislation. Galvano acknowledged that some of his colleagues were concerned the NRA would mount primary challenges against them in the coming elections.\n\nFormer state Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Democrat who attended Marjory Stoneman Douglas, recounted the headwinds they faced with Republicans in power and the NRA throwing arounds its weight.\n\n“Yet, we rolled the NRA,” Moskowitz said, adding: “Not one Republican who voted for that bill in Florida has paid a political price for protecting kids and doing the right thing.”\n\nThe NRA responded by docking the scorecards of anyone who voted for the bill, and it knocked Scott from an A+ to a C. The organization also filed a lawsuit against the state over the new legislation. The case remains in court under appeal.\n\nHammer did not respond to an email for comment.\n\nStill, the law has survived as the legislature has grown more conservative and through the first term of Gov. Ron DeSantis. As a candidate in 2018, DeSantis said he opposed the gun restrictions in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Act, telling one Florida newspaper he would have vetoed it.\n\nDeSantis has not publicly commented on the shooting in Uvalde and his office did not respond when asked if the governor supports Florida’s red flag law. He recently promised Florida would join other states that no longer require training or a permit to carry a firearm in public, like Texas.\n\nRepublicans lukewarm\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell previously told CNN he has encouraged Texas Sen. John Cornyn to work with Murphy on a middle-ground solution in response to the massacre inside the Uvalde elementary school.\n\nHowever, support for adopting risk protection orders like Florida’s appeared tepid as senators headed into the Memorial Day recess.\n\nEven Scott, who once called Florida’s response to the Parkland massacre “an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast,” now seems uncertain about a national risk protection policy. Scott, elected in 2018 to the US Senate, told The Washington Post: “It ought to be done at the state level.”\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of red flag laws have grown increasingly vocal as gun reform advocates hone in on the proposal.\n\n“What you’re essentially trying to do with the red flag law is enforce the law before the law has been broken. And it’s a really difficult thing to do, it’s difficult to assess whether somebody is a threat,” said Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Republican from Texas. “Now if they are such a threat that they’re threatening somebody with a weapon already, well, then they’ve already broken the law. So why do you need this other law?”\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd defended Florida’s red flag law against Crenshaw’s characterization. Polk is a conservative county between Tampa and Orlando that former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by 14 points, and it is also the county that has issued more risk protection orders than any other in the state.\n\n“Let me tell Rep. Crenshaw, if that were so, then Florida, which is dominated by conservatives, the Republicans wouldn’t have passed (risk protection orders),” Judd said.\n\nJudd – who simultaneously describes himself as a law-and-order sheriff and a “Second Amendment guy” – defined a risk protection order as a “cooling off period” for people who have displayed dangerous behaviors. Some are experiencing a mental health episode or expressed a desire to hurt themselves. Others have made threats that may not rise to an arrest, or they are charged with a crime that won’t result in a loss of gun charges. The risk protection orders, he said, allows law enforcement to focus on prevention instead of reacting to an active shooter when “it’s too late.”\n\nIn a Polk courtroom last week, a young woman described her boyfriend putting a loaded gun to his head in front of her and his mother. In another case, a prosecutor told the judge that a woman named Carol “threatened to burn down her house and shoot any responders that would get there.” In both instances, the judge took away their ability to have a firearm.\n\nDavid Carmichael, an attorney who represents local police departments in Polk County in these cases, says in his experience, about half of the people facing risk protection orders willingly give up their right to a weapon without having to go through a hearing.\n\n“They don’t have an objection,” he said. “They say, ‘I’m in a bad place. I fully understand it’s a good idea.’ I expected more people to aggressively defend themselves.”\n\nRisk protection orders\n\nIn Florida, orders last for one year, and can be extended for another 12 months. At the time of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 2,845 people under risk protection orders in Florida, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nJudges may require someone to undergo a mental health or substance abuse treatment before the order is lifted. However, unless convicted of a felony, most people are likely to get their firearms returned after a year.\n\nTampa city attorney Michael Schmid described an individual under the influence of a drug who was acting strange in public and making people uncomfortable. Police confronted him and found guns in every part of his car. They later searched his home and found an arsenal of 100 guns “if not more,” Schmid said, with some hidden in stuffed animals and a cat scratch post. A sign in the house said, “If they ever come in my house, I’m not going easy.”\n\n“I hope he accomplished something during the cooling off period and having him evaluated helped,” Schmid said. “But at the end of the day, he will get his guns back.”\n\nAs it is, some activists don’t see red flag laws as going far enough to curb gun violence. Many Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for the 2018 legislation to include a ban on the AR-15, the weapon used in the vast majority of mass shootings, and other semiautomatic long guns.\n\nIn a news conference with Florida Democrats in response to the Uvalde tragedy, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith of Orlando noted some states allow loved ones and family members to petition the courts for a risk protection order. Those are the people “who know the person best,” he said. Florida limits petitions to law enforcement.\n\n“That’s why it’s important in Florida that we expand on the good move we made in enacting the red flag law in the first place, to make sure we can continue to prevent these instances of gun violence,” Smith said.\n\nMoskowitz, now running to represent Parkland in the US House of Representatives, said moving the ball 20 yards is still a victory. “And you come back and you move the ball another 20 yards.”\n\nGalvano said Florida was able to act because the legislation “had aspects that both parties wanted and liked and aspects that both parties did not support.”\n\n“Look at the politics and understand we are a conservative state,” Galvano said. “We’re red by all accounts. And we were still able to make some reforms that were not traditional.”\n\n‘It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect’\n\nTony Montalto’s daughter Gina was killed inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018. Within days of the massacre, he and other Parkland parents became a unified force in pressuring Florida lawmakers to take meaningful action.\n\nMontalto, as president of Stand with Parkland, has spent the last four years urging more states to follow Florida’s lead in hopes no parents would have to experience his pain. There are 19 states plus the District of Columbia with red flag laws, and 14 were passed after Parkland.\n\nIt’s a legacy that makes Montalto proud, but makes it all the more difficult to watch a similar tragedy unfold in Texas.\n\n“They would’ve been a lot safer had they taken advantage of simple things, such as red flags that we passed in Florida. This is simple stuff that keeps the majority of people safe,” Montalto said. “We heard extremists say this was a gun grab and all these bad things would happen. But the sky has not fallen. People still own guns. People still hunt. People still protect themselves. And yet, thousands of people in Florida have had their guns taken away to protect the majority of people.”\n\n“We had President Trump support red flag laws. We’ve seen President Biden support red flag laws. How come Congress has not acted?”\n\nShannon Frattaroli, a professor in the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, is reviewing risk protection cases in six states, including Florida. Her research has found hundreds of examples of police using red flag laws to remove weapons from people who have threatened mass violence.\n\n“If even 1% of the orders that are issued in response to a threat of mass violence makes a difference, that’s pretty powerful,” Frattaroli said. “It doesn’t have to be highly effective to have an effect.”", "authors": ["Steve Contorno Leyla Santiago Denise Royal", "Steve Contorno", "Leyla Santiago", "Denise Royal"], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/06/politics/louisiana-anti-trans-sports-ban-enacted/index.html", "title": "Louisiana enacts anti-trans sports ban after its Democratic governor ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLouisiana banned transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams consistent with their gender at all public and some private elementary and secondary schools and colleges on Monday after the state’s Democratic governor declined to take executive action on the controversial measure.\n\nGov. John Bel Edwards’ decision not to veto or directly approve SB 44 means that his state’s Republican-led legislature succeeded in passing the ban nearly a year after the governor had killed a similar version of the legislation last June, calling it discriminatory. Per state law, the governor needed to take direct action on the legislation before Monday in order to have a say in its fate.\n\nLouisiana now joins a growing list of states that have enacted such bans in recent years, including at least six in 2022 alone. In pushing such measures, conservatives have argued that transgender women and girls have physical advantages ​over cisgender women and girls in sports, though a 2017 report found “no direct or consistent research” on any such advantage.\n\nEdwards said at a news conference on Monday that he remains opposed to the ban but it was clear to him that lawmakers would move to override his veto if he issued another one this year.\n\n“Whether it’s intended or not, the effect is to tell – send a strong message to at least some of these young people that they shouldn’t be who they think they are, who they believe they are, who they know that they are,” he said. “And I find that very distressing. I do believe that we can be better than that.”\n\nLouisiana’s law, titled the Fairness in Womens Sports Act, is like many of the other bans passed by Republican-led states this year and in 2021. It requires all public schools and some private schools that receive state funding to designate sports teams based on “biological sex,” thus prohibiting trans women and girls from participating on women’s athletic teams.\n\nThe law defines “biological sex” as “a statement of a student’s biological sex on the student’s official birth certificate which is entered at or near the time of the student’s birth.”\n\nWhile sex is a category that refers broadly to physiology, a person’s gender is an innate sense of identity. The factors that go into determining the sex listed on a birth certificate may include anatomy, genetics and hormones, and there is broad natural variation in each of these categories. For this reason, critics have said the language of “biological sex,” as used in this legislation, is overly simplistic and misleading.\n\nThe law shields schools, coaches and other school employees enforcing the ban from any legal action and allows cisgender women to take legal action if they claim they were “deprived of an athletic opportunity” because of a violation of the ban.\n\nWhen Edwards vetoed the ban last year, he said in a statement that “discrimination is not a Louisiana value, and this bill was a solution in search of a problem that simply does not exist in Louisiana.” He also pointed to an announcement by the NCAA that the body doesn’t support such bans and is closely monitoring them to make sure NCAA championships can be held “in ways that are welcoming and respectful of all participants.”\n\nSo far this year, other GOP-led states that have enacted such bans include Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Last year, Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Mississippi, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia enacted similar sports bans, infuriating LGBTQ advocates, who argue that conservatives are creating an issue where there isn’t one.\n\nThe Human Rights Campaign, one of the nation’s largest LGBTQ rights groups, had urged Edwards to veto SB 44, saying in a statement after the bill cleared the state House last month that the legislation “is a discriminatory attack and further isolates students that are already struggling to live a normal childhood.”\n\n“This false narrative that Louisiana politicians are ‘defending’ women in sports is dangerous and misleading; they have cared about women’s sports for exactly as long as they’ve used it as a reason to attack LGBTQ+ people, and not a second longer,” Cathryn Oakley, the group’s state legislative director and senior counsel, said in a statement in May.", "authors": ["Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/politics/state-abortion-bans-democrats-invs/index.html", "title": "Republicans have unlikely allies in their fight to restrict abortion at ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTexas state Sen. Eddie Lucio, Jr. has voted for anti-abortion legislation more than a dozen times in the last decade. He was one of the state lawmakers who both sponsored and voted for the controversial “Heartbeat Bill,” which criminalized abortion as soon as a fetus’ heartbeat is detected and did not include exceptions for victims of rape or incest. He also voted for the state’s so-called trigger ban, which outlawed the procedure almost entirely upon the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nHe is “the extremist right’s trusted vote when it comes to attacking abortion access,” one abortion rights advocacy group in Texas proclaimed in 2021.\n\nHe is also a lifelong Democrat.\n\nA CNN analysis of legislative records and reported party affiliations shows that the Republicans passing increasingly strict abortion bans around the country have been joined by scores of unlikely allies: Democrats.\n\nMore than 140 Democrats from eight of the roughly dozen states with the most restrictive abortion laws voted in favor of the bans, and the vast majority of these state lawmakers were men.\n\nAll but one of the laws would have passed with Republican votes alone, and a few were passed without a single vote from a Democratic lawmaker. Republican legislators almost always voted in favor of the restrictions, which experts say shows how the issue has been much more of a litmus test for Republican state lawmakers than it has for Democrats.\n\nThe right to abortion had been guaranteed in the United States for nearly 50 years until the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in June. In its wake, the procedure has been outlawed or severely restricted thanks to state trigger bans and other anti-abortion laws passed between 2005 and today that are now taking effect. Most of these laws were passed in the last five years, though two of the state trigger bans were passed more than a decade ago in the hopes that Roe v. Wade would someday be overturned. In Mississippi, for example, a law that passed in 2007 received yes votes from more than 60 Democrats — some of whom have since crossed over to the Republican Party. In this case, the law would not have passed without that support from Democrats.\n\nThese strict abortion bans run contrary to public opinion, with more than 60% of Americans saying they disapprove of the recent Supreme Court decision in a July CNN poll. In August, voters in Kansas rejected a ballot measure that would have limited abortion rights in the state, while in upstate New York, a Democrat won a special election for a swing House district – a sign of the motivating power of abortion rights as an issue.\n\nTexas State Senator Eddie Lucio Jr., a Democrat, spoke in favor of a controversial anti-abortion bill in 2021. He told CNN most of his constituents are \"Christians whose upbringings taught them fundamental values of what is right and wrong.\" Jay Janner/AP\n\nLucio told CNN that being an anti-abortion Democrat “feels lonely” at times, but that most of his constituents are “Christians whose upbringings taught them fundamental values of what is right and wrong.”\n\nHe said he doesn’t believe abortion is only a women’s issue, since both men and women are involved in conception, and that men “have shown that they have a natural instinct to protect the human race.”\n\n“Many times, I believe, women would choose not to have an abortion if men would demonstrate a moral sense of responsibility,” he said.\n\nMore than 140 Democrats from eight of the roughly dozen states with the most restrictive abortion laws voted in favor of the bans.\n\nThe national Democratic Party’s stance on abortion is clear. “Like the majority of Americans, Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion,” its party platform states. “We oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights…”\n\nBut that is not always the case for individual Democratic state legislators.\n\nIn Arkansas, four of the state’s 29 Democrats voted in 2019 to pass the trigger ban that criminalized abortion under nearly all circumstances. They were all men. That same year, 14 male and five female Democrats in Kentucky voted for a similar state ban, representing nearly 40% of all Democrats in the state legislature at the time. And in Mississippi, nine male Democratic lawmakers voted in 2018 to pass the 15-week abortion ban that ultimately led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The laws received almost unanimous support from Republicans, except for a single no vote in Arkansas.\n\nA 2022 bill strengthening Louisiana’s trigger ban, meanwhile, was passed with the help of 10 male and two female Democratic lawmakers and signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. “I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact,” Edwards said in a statement in June, noting that he signed the bill despite his objection to the lack of exceptions for rape and incest victims. A spokesperson for Edwards told CNN that the governor intends to work with lawmakers to hopefully pass an exception for victims of rape and incest and noted that the bill he signed “sought to clarify” a ban passed in 2006 before he became governor.\n\n\"I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact,\" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who is a Democrat. Matthew Hinton/AP\n\nFormer Kentucky Democratic state representative and gubernatorial candidate Rocky Adkins said in a 2019 radio interview that in addition to his personal beliefs, his votes represent the views of his constituents in a “very conservative district.” Bruce Maloch, who no longer serves in the state legislature, is one of the Arkansas Democrats who voted in favor of the state’s trigger ban. He was described as a “a deer-hunting, abortion-opposing local Baptist deacon” in a 2020 local newspaper column lamenting the Republican attack ads against him. Maloch and Adkins did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAlso in Kentucky, former state Rep. Joe Graviss told a local newspaper in 2020 that he had tried to emphasize his “pro-life” beliefs throughout his campaign for state Senate but still lost. Graviss declined to discuss his anti-abortion votes with CNN, saying the issue is a “very personal” one for him, but also said he is frustrated with how local Democrats are painted as being the same as national Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which is not always the case. “You have people putting up big signs in their fields on major parkways saying if you vote for a Democrat you’re going to hell,” he said. “You have pastors telling their congregations who to vote for and putting the list tacked on church front doors with damning repercussions if they don’t vote that way.”\n\nFormer Kentucky representative Joe Graviss said he is frustrated with how local Democrats are painted as being the same as national Democrats. Nikki Boliaux/USA Today Network\n\nIn all, men represented more than 80% of the Democratic votes in state legislatures in favor of the bans.\n\nCNN’s analysis of state Democrats echoes how gender has played a role in Congress as well. An analysis of abortion-related voting in the House of Representatives between 1993 and 2018 published last year by two Georgetown researchers found that Democratic men were more likely to vote in favor of bills restricting abortion than their female counterparts, which the researchers attributed to how female Democrats are often elected in more liberal districts.\n\nCurrently, the only two Democratic members of Congress to publicly oppose abortion are: Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, which was noted in a recent column about the “end of pro-life Democrats” at the federal level. Republican women in the House, meanwhile, have historically been more likely than Republican men to oppose anti-abortion legislation, the Georgetown researchers noted, but that gender gap has disappeared in recent years as more moderate candidates were replaced by “strongly pro-life women from the South and Midwest.”\n\nAt the same time, experts say framing abortion as a women’s issue may prevent men from taking up the abortion-rights side of the cause, whether as advocates or lawmakers — saying anti-abortion activists have strategically capitalized on the power men wield in politics and business. “Let’s be real: there’s a WHOLE lot of men whose lives, careers, and families have benefited from an abortion,” US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted in the wake of Roe’s reversal. “Men, we need you right now. You can get through in rooms others can’t. Your power matters.” Some abortion rights advocates also note that gender-based framing of the issue leaves out transgender and nonbinary people who could be affected.\n\nZiad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who specializes in the politics of abortion, said that “politicians often have easily identifiable political reasons for their stance on abortion,” saying that some Democrats may be voting for anti-abortion legislation more to maintain their seat in a conservative district than because it is a deeply-held personal belief.\n\nMunson noted that the finding that Democratic state lawmakers have been more likely to cross party lines shows how abortion became much more of a core issue for the Republican Party, while Democrats have allowed “for more diversity of views for a longer period of time.” This has been particularly true in the South, he said, where Democrats have been historically more conservative.\n\nThat may be changing, however, as lawmakers adapt to a shifting political landscape. Munson said it will be telling to see how Democrats vote as Republicans push for even stricter bans in a post-Roe v. Wade world.\n\nPeople protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after the overturning of the landmark 50-year-old Roe v. Wade case. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nIn Congress, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who previously described himself as a “pro-life” Democrat, recently voted with his party on a bill that would have codified the federal right to abortion — though it did not receive enough votes to proceed. In a statement, Casey said he was motivated by reports that Republicans would attempt to pass a federal six-week abortion ban — an extreme restriction that he said he had never supported during his time in public office. Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, said in a June statement that he was “deeply disappointed” in the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe and that he supported exceptions for rape and incest, but he still voted against the bill, saying on CNN that he believed the congressional proposal went beyond codifying Roe and would expand abortion rights, which he could not support.\n\nFormer Tennessee state Rep. John DeBerry, meanwhile, had served as a Democrat for more than 20 years but was stripped from the primary ballot by the state Democratic party in 2020. The move came after DeBerry, who later ran as an independent, was targeted by attack ads from the political arm of Planned Parenthood, and party representatives reportedly said at the time that his votes for anti-abortion and school voucher bills, among others, didn’t align with the party’s values.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Tennessee's political arm took out attack ads against Democrat John DeBerry after he voted in favor of strict anti-abortion legislation. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Life has mattered my entire career,” he said in a 2020 interview with Christianity Today. “My principles have not changed, and I am not changing my principles because I have a D behind my name.”\n\nAnd back in Texas, longtime Democratic state Rep. Ryan Guillen announced in November 2021 he would be officially switching his affiliation from Democrat to Republican. Like Lucio in the Senate, Guillen had voted in favor of both the state’s trigger ban and controversial six-week ban enforced through civil litigation. “Rep.

Ron DeSantis' signing of a new bill on April 20, 2023. The bill allows juries to recommend a death sentence with an 8-to-4 vote, a change from the previous requirement of a unanimous decision from all 12 jurors. This change has sparked a renewed debate about the use of capital punishment in the state.\n\nThe new law differs from Florida's previous law, which required a unanimous decision from a jury in order to recommend the death penalty. Supporters of the new law argue that it will make it easier for prosecutors to seek justice for victims and their families, while opponents worry that it will lead to more wrongful convictions and executions.\n\nThe governor's office said parents of the victims of the Parkland shooting joined DeSantis as he signed SB 450.\n\nThe bill received some bipartisan support from Florida lawmakers and some families of the victims of the Parkland shooting who felt that the man who killed 17 people at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 got off too easy after a Broward County jury rejected the death penalty months before.\n\nSigned into law:Death penalty is easier to get in Florida than anywhere in the county under new law\n\nChild rape death penalty bill:Though likely unconstitutional, Florida child rape death penalty bill makes headway\n\nWhat is Florida’s death penalty law?\n\nFlorida's death penalty law allows for the execution of individuals who have been convicted of certain crimes. Prosecutors trying capital felony cases can seek the death penalty after a jury unanimously agrees to convict a defendant — this part of the process remains unchanged. Under the new law, once eligible, prosecutors must convince eight of the 12 jurors that the defendant deserves the death penalty.\n\nIf that threshold isn’t met, the jury’s recommendation will be a life sentence. The decision then moves to a trial judge who will issue the same decision. If a jury recommends the death sentence, the trial judge then has the discretion to determine if they will issue a death or life sentence. The judge must then justify their reasoning in a written order.\n\nWhat crimes get the death penalty in Florida?\n\nA prosecution can only seek the death penalty after the conviction of a capital felony.\n\nAs defined in Florida Statute 921.141 (6), the court will consider a list of aggravating factors such as whether the defendant knowingly created a risk of death to people, whether the crime happened while also committing or attempting to commit robbery, sexual assault, burglary or other serious felonies and more.\n\nWhat forms of execution does Florida use?\n\nIn 1923, the Florida Legislature passed a law replacing hanging with the electric chair. An oak chair was built by prison inmates in that year.\n\nFlorida’s current three-legged electric chair, nicknamed “Old Sparky,” was built of oak by Florida Department of Corrections staff and installed at Florida State Prison in Raiford in 1999.\n\nLegislation passed in 2000 allows for lethal injection as an alternative to the electric chair.\n\nColumn:I witnessed the executions of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. UF killer Danny Rolling\n\nWhere are Florida executions carried out?\n\nExecutions by lethal injection or electric chair are carried out at the execution chamber located at Florida State Prison in Raiford.\n\nThe executioner, a private citizen allowed to remain anonymous by state law, is paid $150 per execution.\n\nWhen was Florida’s last execution?\n\nThe most recent execution in Florida was that of Louis Gaskin, 56, who was executed by lethal injection on April 12, 2023.\n\nKnown as the \"Ninja killer,\" Gaskin was executed by lethal injection on April 12 for the 1989 double-murder of Palm Coast couple Robert and Georgette Sturmfels inside their home.\n\nDonald David Dillbeck, 59, was executed by lethal injection on Feb. 23, 2023.\n\nDillbeck's last words:Donald Dillbeck was executed by Florida. He used his last words to insult Ron DeSantis\n\nDillbeck escaped from custody in 1990 while serving a life sentence for the 1979 killing of Lee County Sheriff’s Deputy Dwight Lynn Hall. Two days after his escape, he fatally stabbed Faye Vann in Tallahassee and took her car. Dillbeck was sentenced to death for Vann’s murder in 1991 and was executed Feb. 23, 2023, by lethal injection.\n\nPrior to Dillbeck's execution, Gary Ray Bowles, 57, died by lethal injection on Aug. 22, 2019. In 1996, a jury in Duval County recommended a death sentence for Bowles for the 1994 murder of Walter Hinton, of Jacksonville.\n\nBowles killed six gay men in three states during an eight-month period in 1994.\n\nHow many people are on death row in Florida and where are inmates held?\n\nFlorida’s Department of Corrections currently houses 297 death row inmates — 294 men and three women.\n\nMen on death row are housed at Florida State Prison and Union Correctional Institution in Raiford. Women are housed at Lowell Annex in Lowell.\n\nIn his own words:So-called 'Ninja killer' describes how he murdered Palm Coast couple\n\nHow many death row inmates has Florida executed?\n\nFrom 1924 until May 1964, 196 executions were carried out in Florida. There were no executions from May 1964 until May 1976.\n\nIn 1972, the United States Supreme Court struck down the death penalty. Florida has carried out 101 executions since it was reinstated in 1976.\n\nLast meal for Florida death row inmates\n\nPrior to execution, death row inmates can request a last meal.

Wade may have been offered a glimpse of what’s to come when Politico revealed a draft Supreme Court opinion Monday night that would upend the landmark abortion rights case.\n\nThough the unearthing of the draft has no immediate effect on abortion access, the preliminary opinion, which was confirmed to be authentic by the court, would overturn Roe v. Wade if a majority of justices decided to join, leaving state legislators to weigh their own abortion policies.\n\nThe 1973 Roe v. Wade court decision affirmed the right to receive an abortion under the 14th Amendment, ruling that abortions were constitutionally protected up until about 23 weeks when a fetus could be able to live outside the womb.\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban, setting the court up to examine decades of precedent set by Roe. Some state legislatures have enacted policies to increase abortion access, including in California, which passed a law in March to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for abortion services covered by health plans, and in Colorado, where Democratic lawmakers codified the right to receive an abortion in the state.\n\nBut many Republican-led state legislatures have already moved to limit abortion access and others are poised to enforce restrictive laws that have remained unenforced since Roe was passed. In total, an analysis by the Guttmacher Institute finds that 23 states have laws aiming to limit abortion access, including some states that have multiple provisions in place.\n\nStates including Michigan, Wisconsin and West Virginia had abortion restrictions before the Roe ruling that have never been removed. Others have approved near-total bans or laws prohibiting abortion after a certain number of weeks – but many of them have been blocked by courts, including those in Alabama, Georgia, Iowa, Ohio and South Carolina.\n\nLegislators in 13 states have passed so-called “trigger laws,” which are bans designed to go into effect if Roe is overturned. In some cases, the law requires an official such as an attorney general to certify that Roe has been struck down before the law can take effect.\n\nThese are the states with “trigger laws” poised to go into effect almost immediately if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas has a law on the books that would ban nearly all abortions in the event that Roe is overturned, except for in the case of a life-threatening medical emergency. A medical provider who violates the law could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $100,000 or both.\n\nLast year, a federal judge blocked another bill passed by state legislators which aimed to block nearly all abortions and made no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho’s trigger ban would make providing abortions a felony punishable by up to five years in prison if Roe is struck down. Exceptions are provided to prevent the death of the pregnant person or in the case of rape or incest.\n\nIn March, Idaho legislators passed a separate bill modeled after Texas’ restrictive law, which prohibits abortion once fetal cardiac activity can be detected, which can happen as early as six weeks. The law also allows family members of the fetus to sue the medical provider who performed the procedure.\n\nThe ban was temporarily blocked by the state Supreme Court last month after abortion providers challenged it in a lawsuit.\n\nKentucky\n\nKentucky’s legislature passed a bill in 2019 which would ban abortions and make performing them a felony offense if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Very limited exceptions would be provided to prevent the death or serious injury of the person giving birth.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLouisiana has a law in place that would ban a medical provider from performing an abortion procedure or providing drugs intended to induce an abortion in the case that Roe is overturned. The ban would not apply to life-threatening or serious medical emergencies, but requires the physician makes “reasonable medical efforts” to preserve the life of the adult and the fetus.\n\nMississippi\n\nMississippi law states that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the mother’s life.\n\nMississippi passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which is the source of the case currently in front of the Supreme Court. The court is expected to announce its decision in June, but a draft opinion revealed by Politico suggests a majority of the justices may be poised to strike down Roe.\n\nMissouri\n\nMissouri approved a law in 2019 that would make it a felony for medical providers to perform or induce an abortion except in cases of medical emergencies if Roe is struck down.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nA law approved by the North Dakota legislature in 2007 would ban abortion and make it a felony to perform the procedure except in cases when it would save the life of the mother. The law would go into effect “as a result of new decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States” that would make the provision constitutional.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill last month that would make performing abortions illegal in the state, only allowing exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person. The measure makes performing an abortion or attempting to perform one a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both.\n\nA second bill signed into law last week sets a timeline for provisions to go into effect, depending on how the Supreme Court rules.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSouth Dakota has had a trigger ban on the books since 2005, when a law was passed to set up an almost outright ban on abortions in the event that Roe is overturned. The law would make it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies and would become effective “on the date states are recognized by the United States Supreme Court to have the authority to prohibit abortion at all stages of pregnancy.”\n\nTennessee\n\nTennessee law contains a provision that would prohibit all abortions except those that would prevent the death of the mother and would go into effect 30 days after Roe is struck down. Medical providers could be charged with a felony for violating the law.\n\nTexas\n\nTexas’ so-called trigger ban was signed into law in June 2021 and would make abortions illegal unless the pregnant person’s life is threatened or they are at risk of serious injury. The law would go into effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a judgment overruling Roe.\n\nUtah\n\nUtah passed a law in May 2020 banning almost all abortions if Roe is overturned. Exceptions include cases of rape or incest, detection of severe birth defects, or prevention of the death or serious injury of the person giving birth. Performing an abortion in violation of the law is a second-degree felony.\n\nWyoming\n\nSigned into law last month, Wyoming’s bill added a provision that would make it illegal to perform an abortion if Roe is overturned, with extremely limited exceptions for cases of sexual assault, incest, or the risk of death or severe injury to the person giving birth.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/07/13/tennessee-abortion-ban-judge-halts-new-law-signed-gov-bill-lee/5429866002/", "title": "Tennessee abortion ban: Judge halts new law signed by Gov. Bill Lee", "text": "A federal judge halted the roll out of a controversial abortion law in Tennessee less than an hour after Gov. Bill Lee signed it into law.\n\nLee on Monday signed into law the state's wide-ranging abortion ban, legislation that will enact some of the nation's most restrictive abortion regulations.\n\nHe signed the bill around 11 a.m. By 11:45 a.m., the court ruled against the law.\n\nReproductive providers including Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and other abortion rights groups filed a lawsuit against the bill in federal court in Nashville in June after the bill passed the Senate 23-5 in an early morning vote.\n\nAbortion providers asked for the restraining order in an attempt to delay implementation of the ban while the case is before the courts.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThey argue the bans are unconstitutional and contradict U.S. Supreme Court rulings in Roe V. Wade and other landmark cases.\n\nDistrict Judge William L. Campbell agreed Monday with the plaintiffs that if immediately implemented, the bill could cause a significant impact to Tennesseans seeking abortions, and the roll out should be halted while the case remains before the court.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have demonstrated they will suffer immediate and irreparable injury, harm, loss, or damage if injunctive relief is not granted pending a preliminary injunction hearing. The Act will immediately impact patients seeking abortions and imposes criminal sanctions on abortion providers. The time-sensitive nature of the procedure also weighs in favor of injunctive relief pending a preliminary injunction hearing,\" Campbell wrote in the order granting the restraining order.\n\nCampbell also found the reverse to be true, that the public interest of the state will not be meaningfully harmed by preserving the status quo pending a hearing on the case.\n\nRestrictive bans\n\nIn addition to banning abortions after the point a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which is as early as six weeks, the legislation, which takes effect immediately, also prohibits the procedure:\n\nIf the doctor knows that the woman is seeking an abortion because of the child's sex or race;\n\nIf the doctor knows the woman is seeking an abortion due to to a diagnosis of Down syndrome; and\n\nFor juveniles in custody of the Department of Children's Services, including removing the current option to petition a judge for permission.\n\nWhile there is an exception to the restrictions if a woman's life is in danger, there are no exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nThe law makes it a Class C felony for a doctor to perform an abortion in any of those situations, and the physician must also:\n\nDetermine and inform the mother of the gestational age of the fetus;\n\nAllow the woman to hear the fetal heartbeat and explain the location of the unborn child within the uterus;\n\nConduct an ultrasound and display the images to the mother; and\n\nProvide an explanation of the fetus's dimensions and which external body parts and internal organs are present and visible.\n\nUnder the law, abortion clinics will also be required to post a sign in the waiting area and in patient rooms informing people that it may be possible to reverse a chemical abortion. Failing to do so can result in a $10,000 fine for the clinic, though that portion of the new law would take effect Oct. 1. There remains no medical consensus on whether that reversal is possible.\n\nLee broadcast his signature of the measure on Facebook on Monday, saying the law is \"arguably the most conservative, pro-life piece of legislation in the country.\"\n\n\"It's our responsibility to protect the most vulnerable in our community,\" the governor said as he signed the measure from inside his office. \"With the signature of this bill, Tennessee is one of the most pro-life states in America.\"\n\nSimilar six-week bans have been struck down in Mississippi, Ohio and other states. In 2019, 25 abortion bans filed in 12 states remain blocked by litigation from rights groups including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, as well as the Center for Reproductive Rights.\n\nOngoing lawsuits\n\nAbortion providers from across the state, including Memphis, Knoxville, Nashville and Mt. Juliet, and two physicians, filed the suit against Lee's new bill on behalf of themselves, their staff and patients.\n\nThe plaintiffs say the state already limits abortion to the fullest extent possible under the state Constitution, but that the new bans' reach would be unconstitutional.\n\nMonday's order does not reflect a judge's ruling on the constitutionality of the law itself, just whether it can be implemented before a court rules.\n\n“This is a victory for patients in Tennessee, but the fight is far from over. This sweeping abortion ban is part of a multi-layered effort to target people who already face systemic barriers to care because of racist and discriminatory policies,” said Ashley Coffield, president & CEO, Planned Parenthood Tennessee and North Mississippi, in an emailed statement. \"As we continue to fight for all of our patients, we’re glad that today’s ruling will allow Tennesseans to continue to seek the health care they choose in their home state.”\n\nThe temporary restraining order went into effect at noon Monday and will expire at noon on July 27 pending a further court order.\n\nA hearing on a preliminary injunction, which may stop the roll out for a longer period or reverse the restraining order, has been scheduled for July 24.\n\nAttorney General Herbert H. Slatery III was named as a defendant in the suit, alongside the district attorneys general of Davidson, Knox, Shelby and Wilson counties, the state health department director and the president of the board of medical examiners in their official capacities.\n\nThe new bans are not the only Tennessee limit on abortion before the federal courts.\n\nThis latest battle push against the state's efforts this year was supplemental to a long-running suit against Tennessee's required 48-hour waiting period before an abortion, which remains pending, as it has for five years, before a federal judge.\n\nAnd SCOTUS last month struck down state restrictions on abortion clinics for the second time in four years, signaling that its conservative shift under President Donald Trump has not eliminated a deep split over abortion rights.\n\nMore:Supreme Court strikes down abortion clinic restrictions in Louisiana, a defeat for conservatives\n\nThe court ruled 5-4 in late June that a Louisiana law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals would unduly burden women. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote, though he did not sign on to the lead opinion endorsed by the court's four liberal justices.\n\nThe court reached the same conclusion in 2016 regarding a Texas law, but since then, Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh succeeded retired Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, giving abortion opponents hope for more substantial restrictions. Kavanaugh joined the dissenters in Monday's ruling.\n\nDiscrimination at heart of suit\n\nPlaintiffs say that the new law would disproportionately affect the health care access of minority Tennesseans.\n\nThe restrictive ban limits access to medical care, including abortion, particularly for those struggling financially and those who already face significant barriers to health care — including people of color and people who live in rural areas, according to a statement from the ACLU of Tennessee.\n\n“It’s past time for the politicians in our state get the message that they cannot insert themselves in someone else’s personal, private decision to end their pregnancy. We will continue to stand with our partners and fight back against politicians’ attacks on constitutionally-protected abortion care,\" said Hedy Weinberg, executive director, ACLU of Tennessee, in an emailed statement.\n\nA request for comment has been sent to Lee's office.\n\nNatalie Allison and Joel Ebert contributed.

And Mourinho was quick to remind Arsenal fans after the game that their team hasn't won the title since 2004.

Chelsea's doctor came onto the field to attend to Oscar but the playmaker returned to action and was only substituted at halftime.\n\nMourinho said Oscar went to a hospital because \"we were a bit scared.\" But when asked if the player suffered concussion in the collision, Mourinho replied: \"I don't know.\"\n\nArsenal couldn't exploit Chelsea's injury problems, only managing one shot on target when Mesut Ozil's effort was collected by Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.\n\nIt left Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger without a victory in 13 attempts against Mourinho's Chelsea.\n\n\"In the first half we had the right intensity,\" Wenger said. \"We dropped that in the second half and came back into the right level for the last 20 minutes.\n\n\"We could have finished the game off...

Yet it was the hosts who did most of the running afterward and were unlucky to lose, with Marcus Tavernier squandering two fine chances.\n\nCity stayed firmly in the hunt for another title ahead of a crucial March that contains league matches against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal.\n\nCity edged past Brentford on Tuesday thanks to a goal from Haaland, but his finishing deserted him after nine minutes at Vitality Stadium.\n\nSent through after Foden flicked on Bernardo Silva’s lofted pass, Haaland — the top scorer in the league — curled the ball wide from 20 yards (meters) to spark big cheers from the home faithful.\n\nThe Bournemouth fans were almost on their feet celebrating 60 seconds later when Andoni Iraola watched his team create an opening for left-back Milos Kerkez, who tested Ederson with a dipping effort.\n\nChances remained at a premium, with the main first-half flashpoint being Adam Smith’s forceful tackle on Matheus Nunes until Foden continued his outstanding month with what proved to be the only goal.\n\nIt was more akin to route one than excellent football as Mateo Kovacic chipped the ball into the path of Haaland, who brilliantly rolled Marcos Senesi before Neto saved his effort. Foden stroked home the rebound from close range for his sixth goal involvement of February.\n\nMoments later, Silva failed to play through Haaland as City started to get into its stride.\n\nBournemouth's players spent much of the first half allowing their frustration with referee Jarred Gillett to get the better of them, but eventually posed City problems with Ederson called upon to parry Ryan Christie’s low effort in stoppage-time.\n\nThey fashioned a decent opening early in the second half but Kerkez wasted a chance before Justin Kluivert tried his luck soon after, with Ederson saving the long-range strike.\n\nThe champions nearly highlighted their overwhelming power minutes later when Haaland bundled his way into the area, but Illia Zabarnyi got back well to block with his backside.\n\nIt failed to halt Bournemouth’s momentum and they should have leveled in the 55th minute. Antoine Semenyo again got the better of Nathan Ake and his cross found Tavernier, but the Cherries attacker fired his effort into the ground and Ruben Dias headed the wayward shot clear for good measure.\n\nBournemouth was in the ascendancy now and another gilt-edged chance was squandered when in-form Dominic Solanke twisted away from Dias and set up Taverner, who dragged his shot wide.\n\nThe next chance for the hosts came when Taverner’s inswinging corner found Solanke, but his header was clawed away on the goalline by Ederson and Kerkez’s follow-up shot was blocked by Rodri.\n\nFireworks were let off near the stadium moments later, before Haaland was substituted by an increasingly agitated Guardiola with 15 minutes left, straight after Neto denied the Norway international from close range.\n\nKevin De Bruyne came off the bench for a late cameo for City after hamstring trouble led to him missing the Brentford game.

It succeeded and, in a rapid response, Marc Albrighton crossed to Vardy whose header was saved by Petr Cech.\n\nIt epitomized a title challenge built on making the most of counterattacks, with Leicester having the third-worst possession statistics in the league.\n\nKante was wreaking havoc, unsettling Arsenal's defense and his curling shot five minutes before halftime was only kept out of the net by Cech's expertly-executed save.\n\nThe opener came just before half time with Kante down on the field. Play was allowed to continue, with Vardy cutting in from the right toward goal before Monreal stuck a boot out to block the top scorer.\n\nVardy sent Cech wrong way for his 19th goal of the season.\n\nManchester United loses at Sunderland after late own goal\n\n\"We are staying up,\" Leicester fans responded ironically. The target for the season was survival.

Bellerin's cross from right was deftly headed down by Giroud into the path of the unmarked Walcott, who steered the ball into the net.\n\nGiroud came close several times to snatching the winner himself before Welbeck found the net.\n\n\"This just shows you at this level the bench plays a big part,\" Wenger said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/02/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2023/01/08/3rd-tier-derby-advances-in-fa-cup-man-city-chelsea-later/51166755/", "title": "City routs Chelsea in FA Cup, 4th-tier Stevenage ousts Villa", "text": "AP\n\nDifferent competition, same outcome. Manchester City beat Chelsea for the second time in less than three days, on this occasion in the FA Cup.\n\nAnd this time it was a 4-0 thrashing, without even needing Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nCity's top two players were given a rest after the 1-0 win over Chelsea in the Premier League on Thursday yet they weren't especially missed, with Riyad Mahrez, Julián Álvarez and Phil Foden scoring first-half goals and Mahrez adding another late on in a third-round cruise.\n\nNext up for City in world soccer's oldest knockout competition is a rival that is likely to be its biggest threat to the defense of the Premier League title. Arsenal, which leads second-place City by five points in the league, will be heading to Etihad Stadium in the fourth round if it beats third-tier Oxford United on Monday.\n\nMahrez scored the only goal in the teams' league match at Stamford Bridge on Thursday. While that was a tap-in, this one in the cup was a curling shot from a direct free kick that sailed into the top corner in the 23rd minute.\n\nÁlvarez, making his first start for City since winning the World Cup with Argentina, converted a 30th-minute penalty after Chelsea forward Kai Havertz bizarrely chose to lead with his left arm as he attempted a headed clearance at a corner and succeeded only in punching the ball away to concede a spot kick.\n\nFoden capped a three-goal flurry in a 15-minute span at the Etihad when he guided home a close-range finish at the end of a flowing team move involving Rodri, Mahrez and then Kyle Walker, who sprinted upfield to deliver a cross for Foden.\n\nMahrez scored his second from the penalty spot in the 85th after Foden was bundled over by Kalidou Koulibaly.\n\nThe problems mount for Chelsea manager Graham Potter, whose injury-hit squad is in 10th place in the Premier League and is already out of both cups — having already lost to City in the League Cup in November.\n\nChelsea fans sang the name of the team's former manager, Thomas Tuchel, during the game and many left the stadium early. It was the first time since 1998 that Chelsea exited the FA Cup in the third round.\n\n“You can make excuses or look for reasons, and you can say it isn't good enough,” Potter said. “Both of those answers are correct. We have to keep improving and stick together. Because clearly we are suffering as a football club.\"\n\nCity manager Pep Guardiola urged Chelsea to stick with Potter, who has been in charge since September.\n\n“I would say give him time,\" Guardiola said. \"At Barcelona, I had (Lionel) Messi there. That's why I didn't need two seasons (to prove himself) and one was enough.”\n\nCity is still in the hunt for trophies in all four competitions and plays Southampton away in the League Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nVILLA SHOCKED\n\nAston Villa conceded twice from the 88th minute and was beaten 2-1 at home by fourth-tier Stevenage in probably the biggest shock of the third round.\n\nAhead thanks to Morgan Sanson's 33rd-minute goal, Villa was reduced to 10 men when Leander Dendoncker was red-carded in the 85th for a professional foul that gave Stevenage a penalty.\n\nThat was converted and the visitors, who are in second place in League Two, grabbed an unlikely winner in the 90th.\n\nVilla has been eliminated at the third-round stage — when teams from the top two leagues enter the competition — in each of the last seven seasons. It has lost eight straight FA Cup matches since 2016.\n\nLEEDS' RALLY\n\nJesse Marsch had quite the ride in his first match in the FA Cup.\n\nThe American coach saw his Leeds team rally from 2-0 down against second-tier Cardiff to draw 2-2 thanks to an equalizer in the third minute of stoppage time by substitute Sonny Perkins.\n\nRodrigo began Leeds' recovery by pulling a goal back in the 65th before the Spain striker had a penalty saved in the 81st after Cardiff defender Joel Bagan stopped a goal-bound shot from Junior Firpo with his outstretched hand and was shown the red card.\n\nThe 18-year-old Perkins came to Rodrigo's rescue with a close-range goal to send the teams to a replay.\n\n___\n\nFOURTH-ROUND DRAW\n\nWrexham, the non-league team owned by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, was rewarded for beating second-tier Coventry in the third round by getting a home match against another club from the Championship — Sheffield United.\n\nIn other standout matches from the draw made Sunday, Manchester United will host second-tier Reading, Brighton will be at home to the winner of the replay between Liverpool and Wolverhampton, Tottenham will visit second-tier Preston and fourth-tier Walsall will host Leicester.\n\nThe games will be played from Jan. 27-30.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2023/05/14/injured-pogba-limps-off-in-tears-as-juventus-beats-cremonese-2-0/70216824007/", "title": "Injured Pogba limps off in tears as Juventus beats Cremonese 2-0", "text": "DANIELLA MATAR\n\nAP\n\nMILAN (AP) — Juventus consolidated second spot in Serie A with a 2-0 victory over relegation-threatened Cremonese on Sunday but midfielder Paul Pogba left the field in tears after yet another injury.\n\nJuventus moved back three points above Inter Milan and was eight points above fifth-place AC Milan, with three rounds remaining.\n\nCremonese was six points from safety.\n\nPogba was making his first start for Juventus since his move back from Manchester United in the offseason but limped off the field in the 22nd minute, to the applause of fans in the stadium.\n\nPogba fell to the ground clutching his left leg after kicking a ball with his other leg.

I can't believe that its true, but it's us.\"\n\nLiverpool has also been the more efficient team, scoring 10 more than Madrid from 19 fewer attempts, according to UEFA match statistics.\n\nThe goal glut in the competition is not just due to more mismatches. Liverpool's habit of conceding goals when leading games led to a 3-3 draw against group rival Sevilla, and thrilling semifinals against Roma — a 5-2 win and a 4-2 loss.\n\nMadrid's defense also struggled in the knockout rounds. A 3-1 home loss in the quarterfinals second leg against Juventus was followed by a 2-2 draw against a wasteful Bayern Munich side in the semifinals second leg.\n\n___\n\n7:10 p.m.\n\nLiverpool hopes European Cup history from May 1981 will repeat itself.\n\nWhen Liverpool beat Real Madrid 1-0 in the final 37 years ago, it was the only time an English team beat a Spanish opponent to lift the iconic, large-handled trophy in the competition's 63-year history.\n\nEach England vs. Spain final since then went Spain's way, though none involved Madrid.\n\nBarcelona accounted for all three wins, beating Arsenal in the 2006 final, and Manchester United twice, in 2009 and two years later.\n\nMadrid has lost all three of its European finals against British teams.\n\nAn Aberdeen team managed by Alex Ferguson beat Alfredo Di Stefano's Madrid in the 1983 European Cup Winners' Cup final.

Liverpool appears to have brought more fans from Asia and Africa, while Real has supporters from South America.\n\nSome had long journeys, like Liverpool supporter Eric Luk, who came from Hong Kong via Kazakhstan over almost a whole day and night.\n\nIt's not been all plain sailing.

Now it's packed with fans ahead of the Champions League final.\n\nPopularly known as Maidan, in late 2013 and early 2014 the square was the scene of protests which eventually ousted then-President Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nCrowds camped out on the square for weeks, battled police, and more than 100 people were shot dead on the square and in surrounding streets.\n\nOn Saturday, Real Madrid and Liverpool supporters mixed with locals on the square as musical fountains played Frank Sinatra's \"My Way.\"\n\n\"I came here in 2014 and these buildings were all charred and there were tires everywhere after the demonstrations,\" says Stefan Polotajko, a British Liverpool fan with relatives in Ukraine. \"The way it's been transformed is absolutely amazing.\"\n\nAlso on the square was Lyudmyla Agafonova, who moved to Kiev with her family because of the conflict with Russia-backed separatists in her home city of Donetsk.\n\nShe says \"the Real fans are more fun. Liverpool are a bit more restrained, like the English in general. We're happy it's all happening here.\"\n\nHer husband Serhiy adds \"it's great to have all these foreigners here,\" and \"Ukraine is slowly getting closer to Europe.\"\n\n___\n\n4:39 p.m.\n\nKiev police say they evacuated five stations on the city's subway network after a hoax caller warned of bomb attacks.\n\nAhead of the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid, police checked the stations and \"dangerous items were not found.\"\n\nSubway operations are now back to normal.\n\nThe police say they're now hunting the hoax caller.\n\nBesides the bomb scare, police have so far registered 26 crimes involving foreigners, whether as victims or perpetrators.\n\nThat includes 10 cases of theft, three of hooliganism and two of fraud. Other foreigners were fined for causing a road accident and drinking in public.\n\nPolice earlier detained two people after Liverpool fans were attacked at a restaurant on Thursday, leaving two injured.\n\n___\n\n4:23 p.m.\n\nFans are thronging the center of Kiev after many experienced travel problems.\n\nFlight cancellations meant more than 1,000 Liverpool supporters could not leave Britain, while soaring accommodation prices persuaded roughly the same number of Madrid fans to have their ticket money refunded rather than travel to Ukraine.\n\nOrganizer UEFA has said refunded tickets will be made available to locals but there is likely to be the unusual sight of empty seats at a Champions League final.\n\nThose fans who did make it are largely positive about Kiev, where the beer is cheap and a festival atmosphere is apparent in the city center.\n\nMadrid fans Fabino Mohino and Yago Saez said they spent about 750 euros ($875) apiece on flights and traveled for 20 hours through Barcelona.\n\n\"We were lucky to have a friend of a friend in the suburbs,\" Mohino said, meaning they could dodge Kiev hotel prices which are as much as $2,000 a night.\n\n\"Loving it,\" added Saez, who has attended six of the last seven Champions League finals. \"So far, so good.\"\n\nSecurity is tight in Kiev, with police lining the center, which has been closed to traffic.

Wagner was Klopp's best man. They played for the same Mainz team in the Bundesliga in the early 1990s. They were coach (Klopp) and assistant coach (Wagner) for Borussia Dortmund from 2011-15.\n\nKlopp was hired by Liverpool in 2015 when Wagner was appointed Huddersfield manager.\n\nWagner says Klopp \"is able to deliver an atmosphere where everyone is relaxed but focused enough and this is why I am pretty confident they have a chance.\"\n\n___\n\n12:45 p.m.\n\nThere is 4.5 million euros ($5.2 million) extra prize money at stake for the winner Saturday, on top of the tens of millions Liverpool and Real Madrid have earned already from organizer UEFA this season.\n\nThe champion will earn 15.5 million euros ($18.1 million) and the runner-up gets 11 million euros ($12.8 million). That money from UEFA includes each club's share of ticket revenue.\n\nUEFA will distribute more than 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in prize money among the 32 teams that qualified for the group stage.\n\nAll 32 clubs get almost 13 million euros ($15.2 million) for entering, bonuses for wins and draws in group-stage games, fees for reaching each knockout round, and a share of their national broadcasting deal (known as \"market pool\" money).\n\nMadrid is on target to pocket at least 80 million euros ($93.3 million) from UEFA. Liverpool should get at least 75 million euros ($87.5 million), including a 2 million euros ($2.3 million) bonus for advancing from the playoff round last August.\n\nPrize money is expected to rise by around 30 percent next season when a new, three-year cycle of broadcasting and sponsorship deals kick in.\n\n___\n\n11:50 a.m.\n\nDon't be surprised if it takes until Sunday for the Champions League title to be decided.\n\nReal Madrid and Liverpool kick off at 9:45 p.m. local time in Kiev, that's 1845 GMT. The game will go beyond midnight if the score is level after 90 minutes and 30 minutes of extra time are needed.\n\nThree of the past six finals also needed a penalty shootout after extra time, and that would push the action close to 12:30 a.m. in the Ukrainian capital.\n\nMadrid and Liverpool have combined to win 17 titles since the competition began in the 1955-56 season.\n\nWhile Madrid is chasing a record-extending 13th win, Liverpool would go third on the all-time list by winning its sixth. AC Milan ranks second with seven European titles.\n\nOf all the teams with at least three titles, Madrid and Liverpool boast the best record in finals.\n\nTwo-time defending champion Madrid is chasing the first hat-trick of titles since Bayern Munich won each European Cup final from 1974-76. Ajax also won three in a row from 1971-73.\n\nIt would also give Madrid four titles in five years — the best streak since the Spanish club won the first five editions through 1960.\n\n___\n\n11:45 a.m.\n\nLiverpool and Real Madrid fans are gathering in Kiev for the first Champions League final to be played in Ukraine.\n\nThe final is a rare prestige moment for a country whose recent years have been dominated by the conflict with Russia-backed separatists and severe economic problems.\n\nBut it's one of the most logistically-challenging locations chosen by UEFA for its showpiece club final, with a shortage of hotel rooms and a lack of flight landing slots.\n\nFueled by Cristiano Ronaldo's goals, Madrid is chasing a 13th European Cup title.\n\nLiverpool has reached the final for the first time in 11 years.

Kagawa then wrong-footed Norwich goalkeeper Mark Bunn in the 76th after running onto Rooney's pass and he chipped Bunn to complete his hat trick three minutes from time.\n\nThe 23-year-old Kagawa had scored only twice for United before Saturday and Ferguson said he expects more from him next season.\n\n\"He is a good finisher,\" Ferguson said. \"His second goal was composed and intelligent, his last was brilliant.\n\n\"He missed that period of football in October and November that set him back a bit. He is gradually getting his form back but next year he will be far better, you will see a really good player then.\"\n\nUnited defender Rio Ferdinand, who didn't play against Norwich, took to Twitter to praise Kagawa and his \"2 silky feet.\"\n\nDespite his exploits, Kagawa is unlikely to be retained in United's team for Tuesday's Champions League match against Real Madrid having started with midfielders Nani, Ashley Young and Tom Cleverley on the bench for the Norwich game.\n\nGiggs wasn't even in the matchday squad on Saturday but will return against Madrid, where he will make his 1,000th senior competitive appearance, taking in club and country.\n\nChelsea 1, West Bromwich Albion 0\n\nLONDON (AP) — Demba Ba gave under-fire Chelsea manager Rafa Benitez some much-needed respite by scoring the winner in a 1-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday, provisionally moving the team into third place in the English Premier League.\n\nA toxic atmosphere had been expected at Stamford Bridge after Benitez's outburst on Wednesday, when he criticized the club's board and supporters for not giving him their full backing since his appointment as interim manager.\n\nHowever, the backlash never materialized and Ba's 28th-minute goal, from David Luiz's nod-down, helped remove any tension that may have surfaced.\n\nChelsea was dominant save for a nervy final 10 minutes, and secured a third straight home win in the league to climb above Tottenham, which plays Arsenal on Sunday.\n\nThere was a muted response when Benitez emerged from the tunnel and he received only isolated abuse during the game. He has had far worse in his troubled 101-day tenure and maybe his plea for unity got through to some fans, although there was a smattering of banners around the ground — including one that read 'Divided We Fall (hash)Rafaout.'\n\n\"I was really pleased with the performance on the pitch and the atmosphere was really good,\" Benitez said.\n\n\"I was really pleased with the fans behind the team,\" he added. \"The players played with more confidence and it was clear it was very positive.\"\n\nWith Chelsea playing some delightful football in the first half, there was no real need for supporters to vent their anger at Benitez after that.\n\nOscar and Juan Mata had already been denied by West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster by the time Ba opened the scoring with a well-worked corner routine that saw the ball arrive at the feet of Oscar. His cross was met at the far post by fellow Brazilian Luiz, whose header back across goal was met by a low finish from Ba. It was his 15th league goal.\n\nWest Brom, which was without top scorer Romelu Lukaku because he was ineligible to play against his parent club, was posing Chelsea no problems and the hosts maintained their dominance in the second half, although the second goal wouldn't come.\n\nBa missed a great chance to score a second goal when his goalbound shot from close range was blocked while winger Eden Hazard was denied a penalty after appearing to be bundled over by Jonas Olsson. Oscar's volley from Ba's nod-down was well saved by Foster in the 78th.\n\nThe longer the game went on, the more tense the crowd became and substitute Peter Odemwingie drew a great save out of Petr Cech with a long-range free kick. From the resulting corner, the Czech Republic goalkeeper needed to show more reflexes to bat away a header toward his own goal by Cesar Azpilicueta.\n\nThere is recent precedent for a change of Chelsea manager following losses to West Brom, with the Baggies being the final Premier League opponent for both Andre Villas-Boas and Roberto di Matteo.\n\nMany wondered if this would be Benitez's last stand, but the win should ensure he stays on for the time being.\n\nEverton 3, Reading 1\n\nLIVERPOOL, England (AP) - Everton stayed in the hunt for a Champions League spot by beating struggling Reading 3-1 on Saturday in the Premier League. Marouane Fellaini headed the hosts ahead with his 12th goal of the season late in an evenly-fought first half, and Everton then dominated after the break.\n\nSteven Pienaar doubled the lead with a stunning long-range strike and Kevin Mirallas made it 3-0 before Hal Robson-Kanu grabbed a consolation.\n\nThe loss left Reading in the relegation zone and just three points ahead of last-place Queens Park Rangers.\n\nEverton is sixth, six points behind fourth-place Tottenham ahead of Spurs game against Arsenal on Sunday.\n\nLiverpool 4, Wigan Athletic 0\n\nWIGAN, England (AP) - Luis Suarez netted a hat trick Saturday as a rampant Liverpool beat Wigan 4-0, putting the Uruguay forward atop the Premier League scoring list.\n\nAfter Stewart Downing put the visitors ahead in just the second minute, Suarez effectively decided the game by making it 3-0 by the 34th - his second goal coming with a stroke of luck as he slipped when taking a free kick but the ball deflected off the defensive wall and into the net.\n\nHe then completed his hat trick shortly after the break for his 21st league goal of the season, putting him ahead of Manchester United's Robin van Persie on 19.\n\nHe joins Robbie Fowler and Fernando Torres as the only Liverpool players to score at least 20 goals in a Premier League campaign. Suarez has now scored 15 goals in as many matches in all competitions, making him one of the top contenders to be crowned player of the year, along with Van Persie and Tottenham's Gareth Bale.\n\n\"He's such a pleasure to work with,\" Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said. \"He has quality, finishing, work-rate and that's what makes him world class.\"\n\nThe win kept Liverpool in seventh place, while Wigan is only out of the relegation zone on goal difference.\n\nDowning set the tone for Liverpool as he lost his marker in the penalty area to head home a cross from the impressive Philippe Coutinho, making only his third appearance since joining from Inter Milan.\n\nCoutinho was also involved in the second goal in the 18th minute, taking a pass from Steven Gerrard and providing a perfectly-weighted ball for Suarez, who controlled it and finished clinically.\n\nSuarez was then brought down outside the area by Gary Caldwell and stepped up to take the free kick himself. While the Uruguayan slipped as he connected with the ball, his shot clipped Shaun Maloney on the edge of the wall and beat Ali Al Habsi with the help of the post.\n\nThere was no luck involved in the third one, though, as Suarez took a pass from Glen Johnson and beat Al Habsi with a low shot from inside the area.\n\nWhile Liverpool struggled to convert its possession into goals in the first half of the season, Brendan Rodgers' team has now scored 18 goals in its last six league games - including two 5-0 victories.\n\nQueens Park Rangers 2, Southampton 1\n\nWest Ham United 1, Stoke City 0\n\nSunderland 2, Fulham 2\n\nSwansea City 1, Newcastle United 0", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/11/12/arsenal-beats-wolves-2-0-leads-premier-league-by-5-points/50928603/", "title": "Arsenal beats Wolves 2-0, leads Premier League by 5 points", "text": "AP\n\nWOLVERHAMPTON, England (AP) — Arsenal will head into the World Cup break with a five-point lead over Manchester City in the Premier League after Martin Odegaard’s double clinched a 2-0 win at Wolverhampton on Saturday.\n\nThe captain’s goals in the 55th and 75th minutes showed City, which lost 2-1 to Brentford earlier in the day, that its crown is under threat.\n\nMikel Arteta’s team is a genuine contender, grinding out a 12th victory in 14 matches with a performance which demonstrated their steel and composure.\n\nWolves will be in last place at Christmas — league play resumes on Dec. 26 — but held their own for long spells and there are reasons to be positive with recently hired manager Julen Lopetegui’s era about to start.\n\nWolves chairman Jeff Shi called the search for Bruno Lage’s replacement painful after Lopetegui initially rejected the club and Michael Beale performed a U-turn to stay at second-tier Queens Park Rangers.\n\nIntroduced to the home fans before the game, Lopetegui took the acclaim during a lap of the field six years after Wolves first tried to appoint him.\n\nIt has been a long wait and the former Spain and Real Madrid coach will be expected to work wonders to beat the drop but will have the same problems as caretaker Steve Davis and Lage.\n\nLopetegui will need reinforcements in January — especially a striker — for Wolves to extend their top flight stay to a sixth season though he will have at least been encouraged by the hosts’ resilience which will be desperately needed during a relegation fight.\n\nArteta has no such problems and his team will be top at Christmas, something not even the most optimistic Gunners fan would have predicted.\n\nCity’s surprise loss gave Arsenal the chance to push further clear but the visitors were initially frustrated.\n\nGabriel Jesus drilled home a shot but was offside, and goalkeeper Jose Sa hurriedly turned Bukayo Saka’s deflected cross over.\n\nArsenal lost Granit Xhaka, forced off after 15 minutes after needing treatment, and replaced him with Fabio Vieira.\n\nThe Gunners dominated the ball but Wolves reminded the visitors of their threat when Goncalo Guedes fired over following a quick break.\n\nDespite its territorial dominance, Arsenal struggled to create clear openings — a credit to Wolves’ organization.\n\nA driving run from Saka created a chance for Jesus and, with a hint of offside, the striker hit the bar with 10 minutes of the half remaining. The Brazil international, without a goal in his previous 10 games, then wasted a promising opening when he volleyed wide off Ben White’s cross.\n\nWhile it remained tight, the struggling hosts were always in the contest and William Saliba gifted them a golden chance just before the break.\n\nThe defender’s back pass was read by Guedes, who had a free run on goal, but Gabriel came to the rescue to deflect his shot wide.\n\nBut if there were any growing Arsenal frustrations, they disappeared 10 minutes after the break when Odegaard opened the scoring.\n\nIt was the first time the visitors wriggled in behind Wolves and when a delightful ball from Jesus gave Vieira space in the box, his cross was turned in by Odegaard from close range.\n\nFrom then, it was comfortable for the Gunners and Odegaard added a second with 15 minutes left.\n\nDexter Lembikisa lost the ball to Gabriel Martinelli, who teed up Oleksandr Zinchenko to cross.

Even fewer believe the Principality club can now mount a last-minute challenge for the French title.\n\nBut with 12 matches remaining before the end of the season, Monaco still has a mathematical chance of winning the championship. Ahead of a crucial match against defending champion Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday, fourth-place Monaco lags 11 points behind leader Lyon, with a match in hand, as the race for the title remains wide-open.\n\nPSG trails the seven-time champions by two points, with Marseille in third place, two points further back.\n\nMonaco's hermetic defense this season has helped the club to cope with the departures of Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez, although a poor start to the season forced the team to play a game of cat-and-mouse with the leaders.\n\nMonaco's profligacy and lack of attacking spark has long been a source of worries for coach Leonardo Jardim, but he seems to have found the winning formula. Monaco has won its last three matches in all competitions with a combination of grit and style, scoring seven goals and conceding only two.\n\nEven with a tem depleted of half of its regular starters, Jardim gave a masterclass of efficient football to Arsenal counterpart Arsene Wenger in the first leg of the last 16. And given that PSG will travel to Monaco without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Monaco is now hoping for a big win that would mark a turning point in a lively season.\n\nHere are some things to know about this weekend's matches:\n\n___\n\nAMBITIOUS YOUNGSTERS\n\nDespite limited offensive options, Jardim has succeeded in his task of fine-tuning a well-balanced squad filled with talented youngsters. Among them are 19-year-old forward Anthony Martial and winger Yannick Ferreira Carrasco.\n\nGifted with huge physical qualities and technical skills, the highly-praised Martial set up Dimitar Berbatov's goal against Arsenal and slotted home the equalizer in added time against PSG in the corresponding match last October.\n\nMartial's fine performance in London drew comparisons with Thierry Henry in the French press, but he remains behind the aging Berbatov in Jardim's pecking order as the Bulgarian veteran's experience will be a precious asset in the closing stages of the season.\n\nThe 21-year-old Ferreira Carrasco is also at the heart of Monaco's rebuilding project. The Belgian winger, who has extended his deal with the club until June 2019, is fast and always dangerous on the break. He replaced Berbatov with 15 minutes to go on Wednesday and scored Monaco's important third goal.\n\n___\n\nNO IBRA? NO PROBLEM\n\nParis Saint-Germain has three matches to play before taking on Chelsea in the Champions League. Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be missing two of them, a double-header against Monaco in the league and the French Cup.\n\nIbrahimovic, the league's third-best striker this season with 11 goals, is serving a two-game ban following an altercation with a Saint-Etienne player and a third yellow card in 10 matches.\n\nPSG coach Laurent Blanc should not be scratching his head too long as the in-form Edinson Cavani proved decisive earlier this season when Ibrahimovic was sidelined by a heel injury. The Uruguay striker also earned PSG a 1-1 draw with Chelsea when he scored the equalizer after threatening throughout.\n\n___\n\nTWITTER ADDICT\n\nLyon president Jean-Michel Aulas can't help taking to Twitter to lash out at his rivals. But Aulas might have gone too far recently when he answered in provocative fashion to Saint-Etienne fans he called \"autistics\" and criticized referee Clemet Turpin for his supposed mistakes during Lyon's 1-1 draw with PSG earlier this month.\n\nAulas was reproaching Turpin for allowing Ibrahimovic to retake a penalty kick and score after his initial effort was stopped.\n\nAulas' mind games could backfire at him, with the French federation's ethics committee now expected to summon him.\n\nAulas was suspended for one month by the league's disciplinary committee in 2012 for contesting a referee's decisions.\n\nLyon travels to Lille on Saturday looking to extend its unbeaten run to 12 league games.\n\n___\n\nBATSHUAYI ECLIPSING GIGNAC\n\nAfter scoring two goals in the space of three minutes in a 2-2 draw at Saint-Etienne, super-sub Michy Batshuahy is threatening Andre-Pierre Gignac's status at Marseille.\n\nWhile the France international is not as sharp as he was during the first half of the season, the 21-year-old Belgian striker bought from Liege last year is blossoming into a clever and skilled forward with a natural instinct for goals.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Batshuahy will be given a starting spot against Caen, as Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa refuses to choose between the two.\n\n\"Gignac really knows how to play on the flanks, he does that very well. Batshuayi is tracking back to play with the midfielders,\" Bielsa said. \"They have different profiles, and it doesn't take anything away from their main quality, which is their sense for goal.\"\n\nMarseille's main concerns at the moment come in the defensive sector, with Cameroon center back Nicolas Nkoulou out for at least six weeks with a left knee injury and Bielsa short of options to replace him.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/02/26"}]}

Its waters boasted low salinity, just the right acidity and all the chemicals needed to support living organisms. Other than on Earth, the lake was the most life-friendly place in the solar system, according to a study published in the journal Science and announced Monday at American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco.\n\n\"Is this the smoking gun that says there was life on Mars? No,\" says NASA soil mineralogist Douglas Ming, who took part in the new research. \"Is this a smoking gun that this was a habitable environment? There's pretty good evidence for that. We have an environment that is very much … like on Earth.\"\n\nDespite the difficulties of finding evidence of past life on Mars, \"I've always been an optimist that we will find it someday,\" says astrobiologist Clark Johnson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who was not involved with the study. \"This is a wonderful step forward.\"\n\nAfter its triumphant arrival on the Red Planet in August 2012, Curiosity trundled only a quarter-mile from its landing spot to a tantalizing depression named Yellowknife Bay. There it didn't take long for the rover's instruments to reveal an expanse of thick, fine-grained rock, the footprint of an ancient lake. Tests showed the rock, a type known as a mudstone because it's formed from mud, is similar to 10-million-year-old rocks in Southern California. This single lake probably covered tens of thousands of acres, and there were probably at least several other lakes nearby, says Caltech's John Grotzinger, project scientist for Curiosity.\n\nVeins of mineral in the rocks show that even after the lake dried out, water still flowed across the site. That extra water could have allowed life to persist at the site long after the lake's disappearance, perhaps for tens of millions of years, according to the study in the current issue of Science. Adding to the appeal of this watery real estate, a rock sample collected by Curiosity and analyzed in the rover's on-board laboratories showed a wide array of chemicals needed for life: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and others.\n\nWhat Curiosity didn't find beyond a doubt were hydrocarbons, carbon-containing molecules that can serve as an energy source for life and a potential signature of life. The rover did detect hydrocarbons, but at least some of them came from solvents that leaked out of a storage container on the rover itself. The scientists think the hydrocarbon levels measured by Curiosity are too high to be accounted for just by the solvents, but they readily acknowledge they haven't closed the case.\n\n\"Most of us feel there is a good chance that there's something there,\" Grotzinger says. \"It's just that we haven't been able to tease it out at the level of confidence we'd like.\"\n\nGrotzinger and his team argue that even without hydrocarbons, the lake could've supported life, though not the little green men of popular imagination. The obvious candidates are bacteria and other microscopic creatures that make their living off chemicals rather than sunlight. Such microbes are found at Earthly hot springs on both land and the ocean floor, some living under extreme conditions that would be lethal for many other forms of life.\n\nOther scientists find most of the new results generally convincing, though they are skeptical that Curiosity has found hydrocarbons.\n\nThe scientists' arguments that the rover found more hydrocarbons than would be expected from contamination alone are \"tenuous at best,\" says Jeffrey Bada, an emeritus professor of marine chemistry at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, via e-mail. He says that if Curiosity really had stumbled on hydrocarbons, other kinds would've been detected, not just the few purified by the rover's chemistry set.\n\nOthers point out that living things have colonized much harsher environments on Earth than this gentle Martian lake, making it possible that microbes once called it home.\n\n\"If you give it an environment, life is going to spontaneously develop, so why not?\" Johnson says. \"But it's not proven, and people should realize that to actually prove it … is probably many years down the road.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/07/25/atlantic-current-collapse-possible-in-two-years-study-suggests/70434388007/", "title": "Is Atlantic Ocean current near collapse?

Warm, salty water moves north from the tropics along the Gulf Stream off the U.S. East Coast to the North Atlantic, where it cools, sinks and heads south.\n\nThe faster it moves, the more water is turned over from warm surface to cool depths.\n\nThe cycle keeps northern Europe several degrees warmer than it would otherwise be and brings colder water to the coast of North America.\n\nStudies in 2018 and 2021 have found that a collapse of the AMOC is possible at some point this century.\n\nWhat's new in this study?\n\nUsing new statistical tools and ocean temperature data from the past 150 years, researchers calculated that the AMOC will stop – with 95% certainty – between 2025 and 2095. \"Using new and improved statistical tools, we’ve made calculations that provide a more robust estimate of when a collapse is most likely to occur, something we had not been able to do before,\" said study co-author Susanne Ditlevsen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen.\n\nThe researchers' prediction is based on observations of early warning signals ocean currents exhibit as they become unstable.\n\nThe calculations contradict the message of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, in which an abrupt change in the AMOC is considered \"unlikely\" this century.\n\n\"Our result underscores the importance of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible,\" said study co-author Peter Ditlevsen, also from the University of Copenhagen.\n\nHow could climate change cause the AMOC to collapse?\n\nStudy co-authors Peter and Susanne Ditlevsen explained to USA TODAY how the collapse of the AMOC could occur: \"Greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming, which speeds up the melting of Greenland ice. The melted freshwater entering the North Atlantic can then disrupt the AMOC, potentially causing major climate disruptions.\n\n\"When the increased meltwater from Greenland enters the North Atlantic, it's freshwater, which is lighter than the salty seawater around it,\" the Ditlevsens said. \"This excess freshwater can disrupt the normal sinking of the salty water, weakening or even shutting down the AMOC. If the AMOC collapses, it can have far-reaching effects on weather patterns and ocean currents, leading to significant climate changes.\"\n\nWhat do others say?\n\nExperts not involved in this study offer mixed reviews of its conclusions. Michael Mann, of the University of Pennsylvania, said, \"I’m not sure the authors bring much to the table other than a fancy statistical method. History is littered with flawed predictions based on fancy statistical methods; sometimes they’re too fancy for their own good.\"\n\nBut Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told USA TODAY that \"a single study provides limited evidence, but when multiple approaches lead to similar conclusions, this must be taken very seriously. Especially when we're talking about a risk that we really want to rule out with 99.9% certainty. The scientific evidence now is that we can't even rule out crossing a tipping point already in the next decade or two.\n\n\"There is still large uncertainty where the tipping point of the AMOC is, but the new study adds to the evidence that it is much closer than we thought just a few years ago.\"\n\nThe study was published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed British journal Nature Communications.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2023/09/21/osiris-rex-to-return-nasas-first-asteroid-sample-to-utah-desert-after-cape-canaveral-launch/70889914007/", "title": "Touchdown! NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to return an asteroid ...", "text": "Update: Touchdown of NASA's OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return capsule in the desert of Utah at 10:52 a.m. EDT Sunday.\n\nScreaming into Earth's atmosphere Sunday at 7 miles per second, a precious ½-pound sample of rocks and dust from an asteroid should make a soft parachute landing in the Utah desert, giving NASA scientists an unprecedented window in time to study conditions when our sun and planets were forming 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nOSIRIS-REx, the first U.S. mission to collect a sample from an asteroid, gathered 8.8 ounces of material from the surface of asteroid Bennu. That's the most ever \"grabbed\" by a spacecraft.\n\nUpdates from Sunday's event below:\n\nOSIRIS-REx sample return capsule landing confirmed:\n\n10:52 a.m. EDT: NASA has confirmed that the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule has successfully touched down in the desert of the Department of Defense's Test and Training Range and Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah.\n\nSample recovery operations will now get underway. After teams have secured the sample return capsule and delivered it to a clean room, it will be packed up and shipped by a C-17 aircraft to NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nThis concludes NASA's seven-year OSIRIS-REx mission to the asteroid Bennu and back.\n\nEntry, descent, and landing procedure underway:\n\n10:42 a.m. EDT: According to NASA, the return sample capsule has pierced the Earth’s atmosphere, traveling in at about 27,650 mph.\n\nHere's a look at the milestones still to get through over the next 13 minutes:\n\nParachutes will bring the capsule’s descent to a safe landing speed.\n\nA drogue parachute designed to provide a stable transition to subsonic speeds will deploy first, about 2 minutes after the capsule enters the atmosphere.\n\nSix minutes later – at about 1 mile above the desert – the main chute will unfurl, carrying the capsule the rest of the way to a 36-mile by 8.5-mile area on the military range.\n\nAt touchdown, the capsule will have slowed to about 11 mph.\n\nFinally, just 13 minutes after entering the atmosphere, the capsule will be on Earth for the first time in seven years, awaiting the recovery team’s approach.\n\nCapsule released & sample inbound:\n\n9:22 a.m. EDT: According to NASA, a little over an hour ago, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft released the sample return capsule to begin its final descent through the Earth's atmosphere. Since then, with the final leg of its journey now underway, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft has, \"fired its engines to divert past Earth toward its new mission to asteroid Apophis and was renamed OSIRIS-APEX.\"\n\n\"Roughly 1,000 feet wide, Apophis will come within 20,000 miles of Earth – less than one-tenth the distance between Earth and the Moon – in 2029. OSIRIS-APEX is scheduled to enter orbit of Apophis soon after the asteroid’s close approach of Earth to see how the encounter affected the asteroid’s orbit, spin rate, and surface,\" a NASA blog post said.\n\nThe OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule is still on schedule to complete a touchdown at 10:55 a.m. EDT. Stay tuned.\n\n— Jamie Groh\n\nWelcome to live coverage:\n\n9:00 a.m. EDT: Good morning, all, and welcome to our Space Team live coverage of the landing attempt of NASA's OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission.\n\nAfter punching through the atmosphere, the OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule is expected to float down to the Department of Defense's Utah Test and Training Range and Dugway Proving Grounds under a parachute canopy and touchdown at 10:55 a.m. EDT.\n\nStay tuned for more updates as events progress this morning.\n\n— Jamie Groh\n\nOriginal story below:\n\nCapsule to make fiery reentry\n\nThe OSIRIS-REx sample return capsule will make a fiery atmospheric reentry, reaching peak temperature of 5,000 degrees. During a ½-hour span, engineers expect the capsule to slow from 27,000 mph to 11 mph by the time it floats via parachute to the surface, Sandy Freund, Lockheed Martin’s OSIRIS-Rex program manager, said.\n\nThe capsule will leave the spacecraft as an unguided ballistic object that cannot be steered, she said.\n\nNASA officials will unveil the asteroid sample during an Oct. 11 news conference at Johnson Space Center in Houston. Science team members are scheduled to discuss an initial analysis of the rocks and dust.\n\n\"NASA built a new OSIRIS-REx Sample Curation Laboratory where curators from the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science team will manage distribution of samples to scientists around the world over the coming years,\" a press release said.\n\n\"Those scientists seek to learn more about how our planet and solar system formed, as well as the origin of organics that may have led to life on Earth. A portion of the sample will also be reserved for research decades from now, utilizing technologies that will improve over the years,\" the press release said.\n\nRoughly 20 minutes after the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft releases its sample return capsule on Sunday, the thrusters will fire for a new mission to explore asteroid Apophis in 2029.\n\nEverything you need to know about OSIRIS-REx:\n\nAfter completing a 200-million-mile return trek, OSIRIS-REx is scheduled to release the 110-pound sample capsule Sunday from 63,000 miles above Earth’s surface. Tucked inside a protective heat shield, this asteroid sample should touch down at 10:55 a.m. EDT at the sprawling, military-controlled Utah Test and Training Range 80 miles southwest of Salt Lake City.\n\n“My team, including myself, will be waiting in a series of helicopters to fly out, welcome the samples to Earth, recover the capsule, document the environment, and then prepare for shipment to NASA's Johnson Space Center,\" said Dante Lauretta, the mission's principal investigator and a University of Arizona professor of planetary sciences and cosmochemistry.\n\n\"We will hopefully arrive on Sept. 25 to begin the process of disassembly, sample extraction and the final campaign of sample analysis,\" Lauretta said.\n\nAhead of the event, NASA’s OSIRIS-REx engineers briefly fired the spacecraft's thrusters Sept. 17 to change its velocity by a paltry 7 inches per minute relative to Earth. This final correction maneuver shifted the sample capsule’s predicted landing location eastward nearly 8 miles, aiming at the center of its 36-mile by 8½-mile target zone in the Utah Test and Training Range.\n\nMore:Rocket launch schedule: Upcoming Florida launches and landings\n\nScientists consider Bennu one of the most potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids in our solar system. It makes its closest approach to our planet every six years — and in 2135, Bennu could pass closer to Earth than the moon, NASA reports.\n\n\"The asteroid is about as tall as the Empire State Building and could potentially threaten Earth late in the next century, with a 1‐in‐2,700 chance of impacting our planet during one of its close approaches,\" an October 2020 NASA press release said.\n\nProbing an asteroid with an 11-foot arm\n\nThe Lockheed Martin-built OSIRIS-REx spacecraft blasted off in September 2016 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station atop a 19-story Atlas V rocket. The probe reached Bennu in December 2018. After mapping the asteroid for almost two years, it collected the sample of rocks and dust during an October 2020 tricky touch-and-go operation.\n\n“We had about an 11-foot-long arm, and on the end of that arm is a round canister that kind of looks like a car air filter. That's what actually made contact with the surface of Bennu,\" Freund said.\n\n\"And when we saw contact, we fired a nitrogen gas bottle to stir up material — and that device kind of works like a reverse vacuum cleaner,\" Freund said.\n\nOSIRIS-REx embarked on its return voyage to Earth in May 2021. NASA scientists believe Bennu is rich in organic molecules, comprised of chains of carbon bonded with oxygen, hydrogen, and other elements. What's more, Bennu may have water trapped in its minerals.\n\nOSIRIS-REx marks the first time NASA attempted to obtain an asteroid sample. In 2010, Japan's Hayabusa spacecraft brought back flecks of asteroid Itokawa. Then Japan's Hayabusa2 mission brought back about ⅕-ounce of asteroid Ryugu in 2020.\n\nOSIRIS-REx return kicks off 'Asteroid Autumn' for NASA:\n\nSunday's spacecraft-sample return marks the first of a trio of groundbreaking September-October-November events that NASA is touting as \"Asteroid Autumn.\" The other two:\n\n◼ Oct. 5: The spacecraft Psyche is scheduled to launch no earlier than 10:38 a.m. EDT from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy triple-core rocket.\n\nPsyche will travel 2.5 billion miles via solar-electric propulsion to reach the asteroid Psyche — the largest metallic object in our solar system — in July 2029 between Mars and Jupiter.\n\nMore:'Asteroid Autumn': NASA's Psyche mission to orbit and study rare metallic asteroid\n\n◼ Nov. 1: NASA’s Lucy spacecraft will fly within 265 miles of Dinkinesh, an asteroid measuring less than ½-mile in diameter, during its dozen-year voyage visiting 10 asteroids.\n\nLast week, NASA released the first photos Lucy snapped of Dinkinesh from 14 million miles away. The asteroid was discovered in 1999.\n\n\"NASA has invested in multiple missions that are focused on these richly diverse populations of asteroids, and the unique roles that each of those populations can play in telling the story of our solar system history,\" NASA's Planetary Science Division Director Lori Glaze said during a media briefing earlier this month.\n\nRick Neale is a Space Reporter at FLORIDA TODAY (for more of his stories, click here.)

NASA's newest robotic explorer has safely landed on the red planet and is transmitting its first images, wrapping up years of work to get the rover there. After a series of checkouts, the rover's two-year journey to find signs of life will begin. Read the full story here.\n\nOn the surface, Mars presents itself as a world on the verge of inhospitality.\n\nAverage temperatures that hover around negative 81 degrees. A thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere sometimes rendered opaque by planet-wide dust storms that can even be seen from Earth. Gravity that’s just one-third of what humans have evolved to tolerate.\n\nBut the red planet’s features tell a different story.\n\nLooking at photos captured by satellites in orbit, it doesn’t take much imagining to see Mars was likely once home to rivers of running water and enormous crater-lakes. With the right conditions, perhaps this planet that gets its rusty color from iron oxide-rich rocks could once have been suitable for life – or at least life as we know it.\n\nThis dichotomy has left experts asking one of the most difficult-to-answer questions in science today: What happened to Mars, and can the same thing happen here on Earth?\n\n“We know that Mars had a bad past,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate. “We used our Spirit and Opportunity rovers (2003) to follow the water in search of answers as to why this once ocean world is now dry and desolate. Following those missions came our Curiosity rover, which landed on Mars in 2012 and is still operating.”\n\nNow it’s time for NASA’s next robotic explorer – Perseverance – to follow in the dusty tracks of its predecessors. After a 293 million-mile trek across the expanse since its July 2020 launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the upgraded rover is slated to land on the red planet at 3:55 p.m. Eastern time Thursday.\n\nIts target: Jezero Crater, a harsh surface feature that was likely once a deep lake fed by rivers of running water.\n\n“Perseverance is our robotic astrobiologist, and it will be the first rover NASA has sent to Mars with the explicit goal of searching for signs of ancient life,” Zurbuchen said.\n\nBut before it can begin roving its targeted landing site at a neck-breaking 0.1 mph, Perseverance has to pull off a series of risky landing maneuvers all by itself.\n\nThe landing\n\nGetting to Mars with help from a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and interplanetary cruise stage was one thing, but slowing down from thousands of miles an hour to a soft 1.7 mph at landing is another.\n\nThis seven-minute process – from 3:48 p.m. to 3:55 p.m. Eastern – is known as the “seven minutes of terror.” Because signals take 11 minutes to reach Earth, human input in the event of a mishap is impossible – Perseverance is on her own.\n\nThe nail-biting entry is made even more tense by the fact that once mission managers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California get the first confirmation of entry, Perseverance will have already landed – or crashed – in real-time. The unavoidable signal delay, however, is a short hurdle for teams that have been waiting for this moment for a decade.\n\n“Landing on Mars is really all about finding a way to stop and land in a safe place,” said Al Chen, NASA's entry, descent, and landing lead at JPL.\n\nAs it approaches Mars’ thin atmosphere, the heat shield affixed to the front of Perseverance's protective capsule will bear the brunt of fiery entry while also acting as an airbrake of sorts. A massive 70-foot parachute then automatically deploys, further slowing down the 2,200-pound rover.\n\n“While coming down on the parachute, Perseverance needs to figure out where it is,” Chen said. “It’ll jettison the heat shield that protected us during entry and it will use a radar and a new system we call Terrain-Relative Navigation to figure out where it is.”\n\nAfter the newly exposed radar and cameras have a lock on Perseverance’s location and landing prospects, it’s time for the riskiest part: dropping out of the protective capsule with a web of machinery and eight retrorockets, which begin firing to slow the rover down.\n\nAbout 65 feet from the surface, the still-firing retrorockets slow Perseverance’s approach to 1.7 mph. The descent stage then kicks off the “Sky Crane Maneuver,” which uses strong nylon cords to slowly lower the rover down to the ground. After confirmation of touchdown, the sky crane severs the cords and flies off to put distance between it and the rover.\n\nPerseverance is expected to begin transmitting photos of its new surroundings immediately after landing.\n\nThe search\n\nNASA’s 10-foot-long, $2.4 billion Perseverance rover is equipped with suites of technologies designed to aid in the hunt for life.\n\n> Sixteen engineering and science cameras support safe navigation and help observe the surface from extreme closeups to far away. Some of these are part of larger scientific systems, like an ultraviolet spectrometer and another that uses X-rays.\n\n> A seven-foot arm attached to the front of Perseverance includes a powerful drill that can pull core samples from rocks that interest scientists. The samples can then be sealed and stored in tubes inside the rover’s main body for more analysis later.\n\n> Perseverance also has the capability to remove the stored samples and leave them in designated spots around Jezero Crater. A future mission – yet to be scheduled – could one day land on the red planet, pick up the tubes, then fly off to return them to scientists on Earth.\n\n> Unlike older Mars rovers, Perseverance and its Curiosity sibling rely on nuclear power. Essentially a “nuclear battery,” both rovers use energy generated by the decay of plutonium to charge onboard lithium batteries during dormancy. While the Department of Energy-provided hardware can power Perseverance for up to 14 years, the rover’s mission is currently set to last at least one Martian year (two Earth years).\n\n> Perseverance even has a friend hitching a ride for this mission: Ingenuity. This four-pound drone will host the first-ever flight on another planet during a roughly month-long window. Though it has no science hardware, two cameras will help steer the drone and teach NASA engineers how to fly on a world with an atmosphere just 1% as dense as Earth’s.\n\nBut why look for life – past or present – in the first place? For Manasvi Lingam, a professor of astrobiology, aerospace, physics, and space sciences at Florida Tech, it’s the ultimate journey.\n\n“Any sign of life will of course be one of the most momentous discoveries in the entire history of humanity,” Lingam said. “Even if it is extinct life, just knowing that there was something out there is certainly Nobel Prize-level.”\n\nLingam admits getting even a hint of an answer usually leads to more questions.\n\nWould finding life on Mars inform our perception of how common it is elsewhere in the universe? If life on Mars and Earth appear to be similar, could the millennia-old theory of panspermia – that life can spread via asteroids or comets, for example – see a resurgence? Or what if the discovery is so foreign that it doesn’t appear to rely on the building blocks of life we’re used to, like DNA and RNA?\n\n“All of these questions are really fascinating,” Lingam said. “If you find something very alien, that’s great and we can try to understand what it is.”\n\n“It might even have some practical implications because humans learn from biology all the time. That’s in fact how we’ve made a lot of drugs – we looked at actual organisms and borrowed ideas from them,” he said.\n\nThe future\n\nNo follow-up rovers are solidly planned after Perseverance. Nicknamed “Percy” by her JPL mission managers, she’s on her own in Jezero Crater for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut what about dropping sample tubes for pickup by a separate mission? That’s still in the works at NASA.\n\nLingam said a sample return mission has two advantages for scientists: the breadth and number of instruments available on Earth vastly outclass what’s available on Perseverance; and despite technological advances, having a human eye looking at samples is still the preferred method.\n\nFor his research, Lingam would like to see more missions to Venus – a planet that hasn’t seen enough investigation surrounding potential for life, he said. Missions like Perseverance, combined with upcoming investigations of other parts of our solar system, will ultimately provide a more holistic view of the history of life.\n\n“There’s definitely part of me that wants to believe there’s life in the oceans of Europa, that there was life on Mars, and potentially even in the clouds of Venus,” Lingam said. “It’s always more tempting to think of a cosmos that is filled with all kinds of weird and wonderful life because that would mean we’re not alone.”\n\n“One should not allow the belief to cloud one’s mind about the data and the scientific method. But I do hope that there is life out there.”\n\nContact Emre Kelly at aekelly@floridatoday.com or 321-242-3715. Follow him on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram at @EmreKelly.

And its impeccable condition – with no evidence that the reef has yet been harmed by the climate crisis – suggests the need for urgent action to protect the ocean’s remaining healthy reefs.\n\nAlexis Rosenfeld, the photojournalist who led the team of international divers, said the reef, which stretched “as far as the eye can see,” was “magical to witness.”\n\n“It was like a work of art,” he said.\n\nA diver swims above a coral reef found off the coast of Tahiti in November. @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nA detailed view of coral from the reef. @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nThe research mission, led by UNESCO, found the reef stretches for nearly two miles and exists at depths down to 70 meters, or 230 feet. This is around the ocean’s “twilight zone,” where there’s just enough light to sustain life, and below which the ocean transitions into a dark abyss.\n\n“For once, it’s a positive story about coral reefs in the news, which is quite rare these days,” Julian Barbiere, head of marine policy at UNESCO, told CNN.\n\nWarming oceans and acidification caused by the climate crisis has led to widespread coral bleaching. Last year, scientists found the global extent of living coral has declined by half since 1950 due to climate change, overfishing and pollution.\n\nThe outlook is similarly grim, with scientists predicting about 70% to 90% of all living coral will disappear in the next 20 years.\n\nOnly around 20% of the ocean floor has so far been mapped, according to UNESCO. And until its latest discovery, the vast majority of the planet’s known coral ecosystems were believed to extend to a depth of just 25 meters, illustrating how much of the ocean – which covers more than 70% of Earth’s surface – still needs to be explored.\n\n“The discovery suggests that there are, in fact, many more large reefs out in our ocean at depths of more than 30 meters, which have not been mapped,” Barbiere said. “It’s quite a puzzling finding.”\n\nThe dive team was able to spend about 200 hours studying the reef using specialized scuba equipment called rebreathers. @alexis.rosenfeld\n\nCoral reefs are an important food source and habitat for a wide array of marine organisms, such as the fish seen here. @alexis.rosenfeld/ Lacaz'a Productions\n\n“While we are witnessing major investment in space exploration, there’s not enough on studying our own home and the ocean in particular,” Barbiere said. “And I think this is really where we want to put our emphasis in the next 10 years – to create the knowledge we need to put the planet on the sustainable path through marine protected areas.”\n\nDespite its depth, researchers say the newly discovered reef still receives enough sunlight for the corals to grow and reproduce. Some of the divers even witnessed the corals spawning.\n\nResearchers went into the mission in November last year with little knowledge of the reefs existing in the region, and came out with an incredible understanding of how widespread, unique and pristine the coral there is.\n\nDepsite its depth, the reef still receives enough sunlight for the corals to grow and reproduce. @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nA researcher swims above the reef, which stretches for nearly two miles. @alexis.rosenfeld\n\nUsing scuba rebreathers, which filter carbon dioxide out of exhaled air and recycle much of the unused oxygen, the dive team was able to spend about 200 hours studying the reef. Rebreathers allow divers to go deeper into the ocean floor and stay for longer periods of time. The rebreathers contain a special helium-based gas mixture that guards against narcosis or a state of drowsiness.\n\nBarbiere said researchers were surprised to learn that the coral was fully intact and healthy, a sign they’ve survived for decades, given large reefs take roughly 25 to 30 years to expand and flourish.\n\nThe UNESCO team plans to study the reef more to learn how the coral has thrived for so long in the face of increasingly hostile ocean conditions, in hopes that it may hold the secret to saving endangered reefs.\n\n“We think that deeper reefs may be better protected from global warming,” said Laetitia Hédouin, a marine biologist with the French National Centre of Scientific Research and the environmental research center CRIOBE. “So the discovery of this reef in such a pristine condition is good news and can inspire future conservation.”\n\nThe reef exists in what's known as the ocean's \"twilight zone.\" @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nCoral reefs under threat\n\nCoral reefs are crucial to Earth’s biodiversity. They are an important food source, as well as habitat, for a wide array of marine organisms. But human-caused climate change threatens these ecosystems around the globe.\n\nRoughly 4,000 miles west of Tahiti, off the coast of Australia, the Great Barrier Reef – the largest reef system in the world – has suffered several large-scale coral bleaching events over the past two decades due to extreme ocean warming. A 2021 study found 98% of the reef had been impacted by bleaching since 1998. And despite having adapted to higher heat thresholds, the study found the corals now have less time to recover between more frequent bleaching events.\n\nThough the Tahiti reef appears healthy right now, there’s still concern that the effects of climate change will reach it, said Steven Mana’oakamai Johnson, a postdoctoral research scholar and marine scientist at Arizona State University.\n\n“Just because the reef currently doesn’t show any impacts from climate change, it doesn’t mean that’s going to hold into the future,” Johnson told CNN. “And so we can’t just assume that because no one knew it was there, and when we found it, it was in good shape that it will continue to dodge the proverbial climate bullets.”\n\nRose-shaped corals blossom from the sea floor off the coast of Tahiti. @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nFish swim in the reef. @alexis.rosenfeld/Lacaz'a Productions\n\nJohnson’s recent research found that 60% to 87% of the world’s oceans are expected to experience devastating biological and chemical changes, including higher levels of acidity and shifts in oxygen levels by 2060, which would drastically harm the planet’s vast coral reefs.\n\nIn a special report on oceans in 2019, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded with high confidence that the impact on marine ecosystems will worsen if fossil fuel emissions continue at-pace.\n\nEven if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius – the ideal goal of the Paris Agreement – “coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions,” scientists reported, noting that efforts to restore them will likely be futile at that point, given the enormous stress they are already under.\n\n“The big takeaway is that [the UNESCO team] found this track of reef that’s in good condition, which definitely speaks to how little we’ve done to truly map the ocean,” said Johnson, who is not involved with the research. “This emphasizes the importance of passing meaningful climate policy including finding ways to support the traditional stewards of these oceanscapes.”\n\nA group of researchers examine the reef. @alexis.rosenfeld\n\nThe coral in the reef was found to be healthy, with no sign that they had yet been affected by the increasing stress of the climate crisis. @alexis.rosenfeld\n\nBarbiere said more expeditions have been planned for the coming months to investigate the reef, particularly to study how it has thrived around the ocean’s twilight zone.\n\nAn international network of governments, ocean scientists and volunteers are on a mission to map the world’s seabed by 2030 to better understand not only the impacts of the climate crisis, but to improve tsunami warning systems. Studying the ocean, according to Barbiere, could lead to similar discoveries at deeper depths that would require more extensive protection.\n\n“You can only protect what you can measure,” Barbiere said. “And as we are trying to set targets for global ocean conservation around the world, this is the basic information that we need to start establishing marine protected areas.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/17/ticket-mars-red-plant-mars-one/23543053/", "title": "Who wants to live (or die) on Mars?", "text": "Mary Bowerman\n\nUSA TODAY Network\n\nOne hundred people are one step closer to making a giant leap for mankind; winning a trip to Mars. But there's a big catch. The 'winners' won't be coming back.\n\nMars One has reduced 200,000 applicants to 100 finalists who could leave Earth in 2024, the group said in a statement.\n\nFor finalists like Peter Felgentreff, 50, the chance to visit Mars is worth the risk.\n\n\"I've always had a curiosity for all things science, especially when it comes to space exploration,\" said Felgentreff, an entrepreneur and vice president of a start-up organization outside San Francisco.\n\nFelgentreff is married and would be leaving his wife behind for the quest.\n\n\"It's a one-way ticket to anywhere. I would probably die on Earth if I stayed here too,\" Felgentreff said.\n\nHe said his wife shares his curiosity of combining, \"humans with an element of risk and using technology to overcome those risks.\"\n\nListen to the audio of the interview with Felgentreff\n\nThe desire to put a man on Mars isn't new. NASA is planning on developing capabilities to send astronauts to Mars by the 2030s, but those going will return to Earth.\n\nIn comparison, the Dutch not-for-profit organization began its own \"search for astronauts\" in April 2013. It plans on sending an initial crew to Mars by 2024, and the wannabe Martians range from doctors to people without jobs in their mid-20s.\n\nBas Lansdorp, CEO and co-founder of Mars One, said they look for candidates who can psychologically handle living on a planet with just a few other people and accept that they cannot return to Earth.\n\n\"We can teach people engineering, farming and medical skills, but finding people and teams that can actually pull off the mission is our biggest challenge,\" Lansdorp told USA TODAY Network.\n\nOf the 100 finalists, only 24 people will be chosen to actually go to space. Lansdorp said four people will make the initial planned trip to Mars in 2024, followed by new crews every two years.\n\nHow long will they survive?\n\nAn MIT analysis of the Mars One claim that humans can successfully sustain life on Mars found that people could start dying from oxygen related issues as early as 68 days.\n\n\"A lot of the technologies you need to sustain life on Mars are very much in development or there aren't even development programs existing that could support life,\" Sydney Do, researcher and Ph.D. candidate in the Aeronautics and Astronautics department at MIT.\n\nEven if the technologies were created by the time the missions start, the amount of equipment and money needed for parts over the lifetime of the inhabitants would make the system unsustainable, according to Do.\n\nThe group has contracted the space development firm Paragon Space Development Corporation to create a copy of what the Mars outpost would look like. Lansdorp says the mock Mars will be used to \"train our teams for engineering skills and assess their psychological components of living in that environment.\"\n\nWhat's the cost?\n\nThe group estimates that putting the first four people on Mars will cost $6 billion. Lansdorp said the revenue model centers around crowdfunding broadcasting deals and private investments.\n\n\"I can't disclose the level of investment we received, but it's been successful,\" Lansdorp said. \"We are in negotiation with a U.K. investment firm that is interested in financing the entire first manned mission.\"\n\nThe group announced the candidates by also releasing a trailer of a reality series that will chronicle the process that leads to the final 24 candidates.\n\nNorbert Kraft, chief medical officer for Mars One, told USA TODAY Network in an e-mail that \"the audience will have a possibility to be involved.\"\n\nFifty men and 50 women made the cut, including 33 Americans (and five others living in the United States).

That would ...", "text": "Due to global warming, a deep ocean current around Antarctica that has been relatively stable for thousands of years could head for \"collapse\" over the next few decades.\n\nSuch a sudden shift could affect the planet's climate and marine ecosystems for centuries to come.\n\nSo says a recent study that was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature.\n\nThe cold water that sinks near Antarctica drives the deepest flow of a network of currents that spans throughout the world’s oceans, known as the overturning circulation. The overturning carries heat, carbon, oxygen and nutrients around the globe.\n\nThis in turn influences climate, sea level and the productivity of marine ecosystems. Indeed, the loss of nutrient-rich seawater near the surface could damage fisheries, according to the study.\n\n'Headed towards collapse'\n\nThis deep ocean current has remained in a relatively stable state for thousands of years, but with increasing greenhouse gas emissions and the melting of Antarctic ice, Antarctic overturning is predicted to slow down significantly over the next few decades.\n\n“Our modeling shows that if global carbon emissions continue at the current rate, then the Antarctic overturning will slow by more than 40% in the next 30 years – and on a trajectory that looks headed towards collapse,” said study lead author Matthew England of the University of New South Wales in Australia.\n\nSpeaking about the new research, paleoclimatologist Alan Mix told Reuters \"that's stunning to see that happen so quickly.\" Mix, a paleoclimatologist at Oregon State University and co-author on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessments, who was not involved in the study, added \"It appears to be kicking into gear right now. That's headline news.\"\n\n'Uncharted levels':Gases fueling climate change still rising at an alarming rate, NOAA says\n\nAtlantic current also affected\n\nSuch a collapse would also impact a nearby Atlantic Ocean current, known as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, which transports warm, salty water from the tropics northward at the ocean surface and cold water southward at the ocean bottom.\n\nThis current includes the well-known Gulf Stream, which affects weather patterns in the U.S. and Europe. \"The main issue for the AMOC at the moment is meltwater from Greenland, which slows that current,\" England told USA TODAY.\n\nOther studies in recent years about the AMOC drew comparisons to the scientifically inaccurate 2004 disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” which used such an ocean current shutdown as the premise of the film. In a 2018 study, authors said a collapse was at least decades away but would be a catastrophe.\n\nThe Day after Tomorrow?:Study warns of 'irreversible transition' in ocean currents that could rapidly freeze parts of North America\n\nCause of the current slowdown\n\nWhat's causing the currents to slow down and potentially collapse? \"Climate change is to blame,\" England wrote for the Conversation. \"As Antarctica melts, more freshwater flows into the oceans. This disrupts the sinking of cold, salty, oxygen-rich water to the bottom of the ocean\".\n\nSpecifically, more than 250 trillion tons of that cold, salty, oxygen-rich water sinks near Antarctica each year. This water then spreads northward and carries oxygen into the deep Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.\n\n“If the oceans had lungs, this would be one of them,” England said.\n\n\"Simply put, a slowing or collapse of the overturning circulation would change our climate and marine environment in profound and potentially irreversible ways.\" he wrote.\n\nClimate change and hurricanes:Climate change could push more hurricanes toward US coasts, new study suggests\n\nHow would it impact the US?\n\nEngland told USA TODAY that the main impact for North America would be sea-level rise along the East Coast.\n\nIn addition, another impact of the collapse of the AMOC would be a transition to a more La Nina-like-state in the Pacific Ocean, England said. La Niña, a natural cooling of sea water in the tropical Pacific Ocean, affects weather and climate in the U.S. and around the world.\n\nIt tends to lead to worsening droughts and wildfires in the Southwest U.S., and more hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\n\"Our study shows continuing ice melt will not only raise sea levels, but also change the massive overturning circulation currents which can drive further ice melt and hence more sea-level rise, and damage climate and ecosystems worldwide,\" England wrote in the Conversation. \"It’s yet another reason to address the climate crisis – and fast.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/world/repurposed-poop-waste-natural-resource-scn/index.html", "title": "No pooh-poohing poo: Researchers envision an extreme circular ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nImagine you’re eating dinner on a ceramic plate and drinking water from a plastic cup while sitting in a brick house – a seemingly ordinary scenario except that your plate, cup, and your home are all fashioned in part from recycled feces.\n\nNow imagine using your poop to propel a spaceship to and from Mars and shield you from cosmic radiation along the way.\n\nIn my upcoming book, “Flush: The Remarkable Science of an Unlikely Treasure,” I describe how the misunderstood byproduct of our daily living is a vastly undervalued natural resource.\n\nCourtesy of Grand Central Publishing\n\nPoop has power: as medicine, fertilizer, biomethane gas and reclaimed water, among other proven applications. But that’s just scratching the surface of our excremental potential; its biological, chemical and physical attributes have inspired even more wide-ranging and forward-looking brainstorming about what else we can create from our waste.\n\nA hidden asset for space exploration\n\nThe extreme limits of space, in particular, have driven scientific innovation toward a more circular economy where nothing is wasted. That invention, in turn, has hinged upon a universal truth: everybody has to go sometime, even astronauts. Among NASA’s poop-themed crowdsourcing challenges, one recent competition sought a new design ideas for a lunar toilet while another – the Waste to Base Materials Challenge: Sustainable Reprocessing in Space – asked the public to help brainstorm how to repurpose both astronauts’ trash and bodily waste.\n\nIt’s all about self-sufficient flight: Steve Sepka, project manager for the Trash Compaction and Processing System at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California, said one goal is to create polymers from organic waste that could be used in propulsion systems for spaceflight – as well as planetary surface missions.\n\nFor a return flight from Mars, the space agency had initially looked at producing fuel from resources on the red planet, Sepka wrote in an email. But NASA is now considering whether repurposing waste from the crew itself could help the astronauts, well, blast off.\n\nAs for protecting crewmembers from dangerously high radiation levels in outer space during an extended voyage, scientists have suggested that the density of molecules in wastewater could offer a solution. One multi-purpose NASA proposal, called “Water Walls Architecture,” envisions a space capsule lined with multiple compartments of water as well as sterilized waste deployed as radiation shielding. The primary ingredient of both urine and feces is water, and the tightly packed atoms of hydrogen and oxygen in water offer a higher density of cosmic ray-blocking nuclei than metals do. Think of it as a doo-doo deflector.\n\nA water-based shield could work well to block radiation particles, said Peter Guida, the liaison biologist for NASA’s National Space Radiation Laboratory and a scientist at its host institution, Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York.\n\nIn space, every ounce of cargo – including heavy but necessary water – is precious. “If you have it anyway, can you use it for something?” he said. “In theory, it should work.”\n\nA plastic proposal\n\nNow try to reimagine wastewater treatment plants on Earth doubling as multipurpose resource recovery facilities. As an alternative to plastics made from fossil fuels, for example, researchers are making headway in producing safe and biodegradable bioplastics from existing waste streams.\n\nCreating planet-friendly bottles, containers, and other bioplastic products from what we leave behind is still a work in progress, said Zeynep Cetecioglu Gurol, an associate professor of industrial biotechnology at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Even so, developing an efficient and affordable method for recovering new products from wastewater could help offset the money, time, and effort spent by treatment plants to meet pollution limits in discharged water. “I think it’s a win-win,” she said.\n\nMany wastewater treatment plants are already using a microbe-dependent process called anaerobic digestion to create biomethane gas, a sustainable fuel alternative, from sewage. Cetecioglu Gurol and other researchers have found that organic compounds created during that biogas production process provide a good source of carbon for creating bioplastics. The goal now is to ramp up production efficiency. “We are still in the baby steps,” she said.\n\nOne type of bioplastic called polyhydroxybutyrate, or PHB, is naturally produced by some bacterial species as they feed on organic material. Tests suggest that PHB can replace a variety of petroleum-based plastics and that unlike them, it biodegrades rapidly under normal environmental conditions.\n\nA bacterial strain called Zobellella denitrificans ZD1 has attracted the attention of researchers like Kung-Hui Chu, a professor of environmental, water resources and coastal engineering at Texas A&M University. Chu and colleagues have found that the strain, which normally lives in mangrove wetlands, can also thrive on glycerol (an industrial byproduct), wastewater, and sewer sludge. Its ability to accumulate PHB when grown in such a variety of conditions makes it a promising candidate for transforming waste into bioplastics or into other useful products like fish food.\n\nA lofty load of bricks\n\nAround the world, treated sewage solids are still commonly burned or buried. But incinerating waste creates ash that, while reduced to a fraction of the starting volume, is still often dumped into landfills. Here too, researchers are actively investigating how to convert the solids and ash into useful products.\n\nSuch recycling processes could yield a ton of bricks. Engineers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia have focused on relieving the environmental problem of excavating clay soil for brick production, in part by exploring how to incorporate treated sewage solids, or biosolids, into fired bricks. If making poop bricks seems like an unusual application, consider that animal dung has been used to build homes and produce pottery for centuries.\n\nPiles of cow manure to be recycled by the Museo Della Merda pictured on March 28, 2017. Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen fired for 10 hours at nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, clay bricks with varying amounts of treated biosolids from Melbourne residents weren’t quite as strong as traditional counterparts. But they were lighter and better insulators – and otherwise indistinguishable in both appearance and odor. A 2019 paper from civil engineer Abbas Mohajerani and colleagues at the institute suggested that bricks made with at least 15% biosolids could still meet engineering requirements while theoretically recycling the millions of tons of leftover poop.\n\nA follow-up study by another group of researchers at the Melbourne institute suggested that raw biosolids, biochar (charcoal made from biosolids), and incinerated sewage sludge ash could all be used as cement replacement materials. Other researchers in the United Kingdom have suggested that sewage sludge ash could be feasibly reused in tiles and glass ceramics as well, with the potential for wide-ranging applications in the building industry.\n\nThe Museo Della Merda in Lombardy, Italy has, in fact, already created terra cotta tiles, flowerpots, and tableware from a cow pie-and-clay mix. It’s called Merdacotta.\n\nThe yuck factor, of course, may be a higher barrier for repurposed-poop consumer products such as bioplastic cups and ceramic plates. But the hostile environment of space and the multiplying challenges of extracting resources on our own planet are helping researchers get behind a wellspring of raw materials that could aid exploration and boost investments in sanitation infrastructure by converting waste streams into revenue.

The jury found that local regulators were falling down on the job, that local elected officials were serving corporations rather than citizens, and that we needed to take immediate action to stem the tide of toxins in our community.\n\nThe grand jury issued an array of recommendations to improve pollution control, environmental monitoring, government accountability and other issues, but 20 years later, we're still seeing a lot of the same old problems.\n\nIn this special series, the News Journal will look at the state of our natural resources to help answer: Have we squandered paradise?\n\nPart 1: Escambia County haunted by legacy of pollution\n\nSometimes, the water stings her skin.\n\nSometimes, she comes out of the water smelling like a rotten egg.\n\nSometimes, she frets about how much time she allowed her five children to spend in the water, before she learned it was the terminus point for an industrial mill's waste.\n\nBut despite it all, Jackie Lane still swims in Perdido Bay.\n\n“I’d hate to live on such a beautiful body of water and not swim,” she said.\n\nA marine biologist, Lane has lived on the shores of the upper Perdido Bay since 1975. She and her late husband, Jim, built their home amid a swath of moss-covered trees a short walk from the bay's banks.\n\nFor more than a decade, they waded and swam and fished and raised a family, paying little mind to the industrial paper mill to the north. That was, Lane said, until foam, muck and dead fish washed up to her property in late 1986 and propelled her into a life-long battle to keep pollution out of her backyard bay.\n\nLane said it’s been mostly a losing battle.\n\nThe paper mill — whose ownership has changed hands three times since Lane arrived— has perpetually struggled to meet the emission standards mandated by the state, regardless of its owner. Since the 1960s, the mill has been cited as a likely cause of excessive nutrients, depressed oxygen levels, high levels of bacteria, elevated conductance and other problems in Eleven Mile Creek and Perdido Bay.\n\nStill, over the past 20 years alone, the mill’s owners have received approximately $14 million in tax breaks — a time frame when the mill has increased production but shed approximately 50% of its workforce. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection has continually renewed and extended the mill’s operating permit regardless of whether it was in compliance.\n\nVoicing her frustration with the whole system, Lane said, “They want you to think that they’re regulated. That the government is protecting you. They’re not.”\n\n'Those responsible for protecting, maintaining, and improving the environment, did not do so'\n\nEscambia County certainly isn't the only place in America with pollution problems, but the severity of our environmental issues would likely surprise folks who just know us for our beautiful beaches.\n\nEach year in our area, approximately 35 million pounds of industrial waste are emitted into the air, discharged to local surface waters or deposited underground, according to data from the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nCurrently, of 893 metropolitan areas across the U.S., the Pensacola area ranks No. 12 for the total toxic releases per square mile.\n\nOur local landscape is pockmarked with chemical mills and plants that are still leeching toxins into our soil, creeks, bayous and bays decades after the owners packed up and moved on.\n\nCitizens have long been at the front lines of the battle to safeguard our environment, and in 1999, citizens raised such vocal concern about the state of the local environment that then-State Attorney Curtis Golden — with approval from First Judicial Circuit Chief Judge John Kuder — assembled a special grand jury to review the area’s air and water quality.\n\nAfter 10 months of research and expert testimony, the grand jury ultimately concluded what many had long alleged: “Regulators, in general, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, in particular, who were responsible for protecting, maintaining, and improving the environment, did not do so.\"\n\nThe report noted that even though regulators sometimes disagreed about which specific factors were most significant in causing local pollution, they all knew the causes and effects of pollution in our community.\n\n\"Instead of acting to protect, maintain and improve the environment, regulators have done more studies, duplicating previous work,\" the report said. \"They have substituted studies for action, because studies are less costly, and less controversial, than acting to improve or restore the environment.”\n\nThe grand jury ultimately issued 27 recommendations for the county to improve and protect its natural resources.\n\nFrom the timely processing of permits and enforcement of regulations, to more robust sampling and monitoring protocols, to a recommended moratorium on new surface water discharges, to comprehensive stormwater drainage plans, to a call to make dereliction of duty by a public officer a criminal offense, the grand jury offered a wealth of suggestions intended to help the county clean up its act.\n\nMany of the recommendations have been attempted or implemented to some degree, but the sweeping changes the grand jury likely envisioned haven't come to pass.\n\n'Escambia County is a greatly polluted place'\n\nWe've had some big, bombastic environmental disasters like the Saufley Landfill fire that burned for approximately four months in 2005 and 2006, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010 that sent 97% of the oil that washed ashore in Florida to Pensacola Beach and the 2017 International Paper spill explosion that covered nearby Cantonment neighborhoods in sticky, black debris.\n\nBut in many instances, our most damaging environmental issues didn't come with fires and flash and fury.\n\nHistorically, our biggest polluters have simply walked into government offices and applied for permits.\n\nThere are six Superfund sites in the county — areas that have been contaminated by heavy industry and marked for cleanup by the federal government. For context, there are seven states in the U.S that have six or fewer Superfund sites.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2008, more than 400 households were permanently relocated from the Clarinda Triangle area in Pensacola because of concerns regarding dioxin and other pollutants.\n\nUnderground plumes of toxic chemicals have migrated into Bayou Texar, forcing the closure of some private irrigation wells and contamination of sediments in the bayou.\n\nUnfortunately, the list of issues goes on and on.\n\n\"Escambia County is a greatly polluted place from historical mistakes and current ongoing mistakes,\" said Linda Young, founder of the Florida Clean Water Network.\n\nStill, government officials and environmental regulators stress that these are largely legacy issues from Pensacola's history as one of Florida's first industrialized cities.\n\nAs resources have allowed, municipalities, utilities and industries have built up a network of air scrubbers, water filtration systems, monitoring and sampling programs, restoration projects and other initiatives to help keep citizens safe and our natural resources clean.\n\n\"We’re continually marching forward with a series of programs that are incrementally making things better,\" said Tim Day, Escambia County environmental programs manager.\n\nHalf a billion dollar investment in environment\n\nWe've made clear progress in some areas.\n\nIt took until 2012, but Emerald Coast Utilities Authority's downtown sewage plant — dubbed \"Old Stinky\" by locals — was relocated, sparking a downtown development boom that is still picking up steam.\n\nAdditionally, ECUA has been working to help citizens remove or safely abandon thousands of septic tanks that leaked waste and bacteria into surface and ground waters. Likewise, the Florida Department of Health in Escambia County has been systematically removing underground petroleum tanks left behind by shuttered filling stations.\n\nThe city and county have leaned into efforts to improve the area's stormwater infrastructure.\n\nOver the past five years, the city of Pensacola has invested $33 million into stormwater management projects, and previously invested heavily into box culverts to trap trash and debris that made its way into surface waters.\n\nEscambia County has invested about $125 million in BP oil spill settlement funds into environmental projects, as well as close to $180 million in Local Option Sales Tax dollars on drainage and dirt road paving projects.\n\nIn a statement, current paper mill owner International Paper said, \"In 2010, International Paper set 12 voluntary sustainability goals aimed at improving our impact on people and the planet. In alignment with these sustainability goals and with approval from (DEP), International Paper completed a comprehensive $70 million improvement project that upgraded the Pensacola mill’s effluent treatment plant, constructed a 10-mile pipeline for treated wastewater to eliminate discharge into Eleven Mile Creek, restored historic wetlands, and reduced water consumption through the use of municipal reclaim water.\"\n\nThe DEP reports providing close to $118 million in loans and grants related to water quality projects in Escambia County.\n\nJessica Bibza, the National Wildlife Foundation's Florida and Alabama policy specialist, said she believes overall, Escambia County has turned a corner.\n\n\"(After the grand jury report) I think a light bulb went off, and there was a concerted effort to invest in projects and programs and efforts that will help environment water quality and legacy issues,\" Bibza said. \"... I don’t buy into the 'corrupt Escambia County' theory at all. There may be some lingering old ways of doing business, but I see a lot of people who are really passionate about improving the county and the county's water.\"\n\nMany local citizens and environmentalists allege that too often, government entities only take action when problems get too big to ignore, and even then are rarely effective in tackling root causes or holding polluters accountable.\n\nStill more work ahead\n\nNot all of our troubles are behind us, however.\n\nTake for instance the Wedgewood area, a middle-class black neighborhood that found itself with a new landfill for a neighbor in 1990.\n\nAs the years have passed, residents began complaining that the landfill that was polluting their groundwater and air, reducing their quality of life and property values, and causing respiratory illness and cancer.\n\nIn 2011, the landfill was found in violation for storing unauthorized wastes and failing to have a valid remedial action plan. Over the next few years, the facility continued to rack up violations for contaminating ground and surface waters, failing to reduce \"objectionable odors\" and failing to have financial assurances in place for corrective actions.\n\nAfter years of legal wrangling, the landfill's permit was revoked in 2015. In 2016, the DEP was granted a judgement requiring the landfill owners to provide $566,000 in financial assurances for closing the landfill and $38,000, plus interest, in fines. To date, the contaminants on the landfill haven't been properly contained and DEP is still seeking payment.\n\nSeparately in Santa Rosa County, it took months of public badgering to get the local government, the DEP and the Department of Transportation to take action on citizen concerns of red clay being washed into Indian Bayou during a state road project.\n\nAnd in Perdido Bay, citizens have spent decades calling for the owners of the International Paper mill to come into full compliance with the Clean Water Act.\n\nLane, who is head of the Friends of Perdido Bay environmental group, said, \"we're not fighting the mill, we're fighting the government.\"\n\n'Meets all government standards?'\n\nA consistent complaint remains among citizens that officials are still prone to putting industry ahead of citizens, to taking a reactive approach to conservation and enforcement, and to obfuscating the true extent of our environmental issues.\n\nA common refrain from area leadership is that local industries comply with state and federal standards.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Enforcement and Compliance History Online website indicates there are 51 facilities in Escambia County that have violated the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act or other environmental standards within the past three years.\n\nThe list includes all three of the county's biggest dischargers — Ascend Performance Materials, International Paper and Gulf Power's Crist Plant — and several municipal facilities including ECUA and the town of Century's wastewater treatment plants and Escambia County's solid waste management plant.\n\nTracking state-level violations is a much more difficult process, as the DEP's public and official database \"OCULUS\" is notoriously nightmarish to navigate even for those who know specifically what they are looking for.\n\nThe Northwest Florida District of the DEP declined multiple requests to be interviewed by the News Journal, but sent emailed responses to inquiries about its responsiveness to the 1999 grand jury recommendations.\n\n\"The department takes its mission to protect, conserve and manage Florida’s natural resources and enforce its environmental laws very seriously,\" a statement from the agency said. \"We are tasked with the important responsibility of ensuring our regulated facilities operate in a manner that is protective of the environment. Along with state and federal rules and statutes, permits issued by DEP establish criteria and conditions that help protect and preserve Florida’s air and water quality while also supporting a vibrant economy.\"\n\nStill, alongside the many environment-specific recommendations the grand jury made in 1999, several recommendations were aimed at DEP processes and culture.\n\nThe report notes that state and federal law allows industries to continue operating beyond the life of their original permit — regardless of whether they are in compliance — as long as they are timely in applying to renew their permit. Arguing that the process allowed polluters to operate in perpetuity, the grand jury noted that at the time of its report in 1999, the paper mill was on a state permit that had been issued in 1982 and scheduled to expire in 1987.\n\nNot much has changed today, as the mill is operating on a 2010 permit that was set to expire in 2015, but was recently \"administratively continued\" into 2020.\n\nAnother issue raised in the report is that DEP uses compliance monitoring to measure the success of its air and water pollution control systems, but the monitoring only determines compliance with permit conditions and not the actual health of, or risk to, the populace or the environment.\n\n\"When we speak in terms of water quality, in broad stokes one of the very first things you look at is nutrient levels,\" Wade Jeffrey, a distinguished professor of the University of West Florida and director of the university's Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Bioremediation, said in explaining the purpose and limitations of sampling.\n\n\"Water clarity can be a real critical component, oxygen is another big one, and there are others, but it doesn’t get into looking for specific toxins. So if you're really paranoid and worried about a particular pollutant, standard water quality measures don’t (look for) that.\"\n\nLiving at the end of the pipe\n\nMany local environmentalists are deeply concerned about contaminants for which standard testing may not be screening.\n\nYoung, with the Florida Clean Water Network, long championed for regulation of PFOA and PFOS, a dangerous toxin commonly found in firefighting foams. The DEP has \"cleanup target levels\" for the substances, but no formal regulations.\n\nIn a recent report, Washington nonprofit corporation Environmental Working Group released a drinking water report that claimed that while ECUA is within all state and federal drinking water standards there are eight contaminants — including PFOA and PFOS — that exceed standards the organization recommends.\n\nBarbara Albrecht, a marine biologist and a longtime member of the Bream Fisherman's Association, raised concerns about a lack of transparency regarding what's in our environment and how it's monitored.\n\nBetween McDavid Creek at the north end of the county and Pensacola and Perdido bays in the south, there are 14 local water bodies listed on the DEP's \"impaired\" list.\n\nStanding near the shore of Bruce Beach — a downtown park that has recently been reclaimed for public use — Albrecht noted that despite plans to redevelop the area into a major community park, no one is talking about the fact that the area is next door to the former site of ECUA's old wastewater treatment plant, and the water is still plagued by high levels of bacteria.\n\n\"If I don't know the history, I’m gonna come out here and go fishing,\" Albrecht said. \"I'm gonna catch something, and I’m going to go home and eat it. But if I saw a sign that said 'Catch fish but release because we're treating this area for water quality issues,' that would be honest. You can find that information on the Department of Health's website, but it's buried. Why?\"\n\nAnd Lane is worried about what's below the surface of her backyard bay, particularly dioxin and heavy metals she said are accumulating in sludge that sinks to the bottom and isn't being tested.\n\nLane runs a website and a regular newsletter for citizens and neighbors who are interested in the health of Perdido Bay, keeping them updated on pH levels, sampling results and historical data.\n\nShe's been watching with interest to see if new standards DEP has asked of International Paper — including a $131,000 settlement and $1,000 per day fines when the mill is in violation — actually stick.\n\nLane acknowledges that industry is a necessity, and pollution was an unfortunate byproduct of things we need like electricity, nylon, roads and, yes, paper.\n\nBut still, “Living at the end of the pipe changes your outlook totally,\" Lane said. \"People say we need paper, and we do, but not like this.”\n\nPart 2: What's really lurking in the water at Perdido Bay?\n\nWhat do we know about the state of Perdido Bay?\n\nStudio 850, a non-partisan, citizen-led journalism initiative, has been investigating the history of Perdido Bay in a multi-part documentary called \"Have We Lost Perdido Bay?\"\n\nThe documentary features interviews with independent scientists and people who have spent years living on the bay and believe it's in dire shape. That notion has sparked fierce resistance from local government, particularly Escambia County Commissioners Doug Underhill and Jeff Bergosh, who have set out to debunk the group's work.\n\nBergosh toured International Paper's mill in Cantonment — long believed to the chief source of the bay's contamination — and later posted photos of himself having a successful day crabbing in the bay.\n\nUnderhill made his point by drinking a glass of saltwater from the bay.\n\nNonetheless, there is no question that the bay has water quality issues.\n\nThe Northwest Florida Water Management District issued a Surface Water Improvement and Management plan for the Perdido River and Bay in October 2017.\n\nThe SWIM plan indicates that DEP has broken the the Perdido River and Bay watershed into 72 distinct sections known as segments.\n\nDEP had identified 27 impaired segments with 32 total impairments, including 22 segments for mercury in fish tissue, six segments for bacteria (five for fecal coliforms and one for number of beach advisories), one segment for turbidity (cloudiness), and three segments for dissolved oxygen. Some segments had more than one pollutant.\n\nThe upper bay is currently on the DEP's list of \"impaired\" water bodies because samples have repeatedly returned high levels of enterococci bacteria. Enterococci are not typically considered harmful to humans, but their presence may be an indicator for other disease-causing agents such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa.\n\nA 1993 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service study of sediment toxicity found the Perdido Bay system was generally free of toxic compounds, but noted that certain segments were contaminated with toxic organic compounds and metals — to include high levels of the carcinogen dioxide in Eleven Mile Creek's sediment.\n\nToday, the bay is considered a high-priority for a total maximum daily load study, which would determine the levels of various contaminants the bay can safely absorb.\n\nEscambia County staff have been adamant that water quality in the bay has been improving in recent years.\n\nDespite the concerns of community-driven groups like Friends of Perdido Bay and Studio 850, the county's top scientist, Chips Kirschenfeld, director of the Department of Natural Resources Management, said there is nothing in recent data that gives him any concerns.\n\n\"Yes, IP has water quality issues,\" he said. \"Certainly, we get the annual reports and I go over those, and I share that data with the county administrator. I tell them about any water quality violations, and I'm fair about it and I point out that 'yes, there are these violations, but they are at the end of the pipe that discharges into the wetlands.' It travels through 14,000 feet, 2.5 miles of wetlands where it receives additional treatment before it gets to Perdido Bay.\"\n\nHe emphasized, \"All of the data that I’ve seen is acceptable, with no violations of any standards that would make it unsafe for swimming and recreational use.\"\n\nStill, even residents are divided about the Bay's safety\n\nFor the uninitiated, Perdido Bay is a shallow, vaguely hour-glass shaped water body on the Florida-Alabama border. Its upper bay and lower bay are split roughly in half by U.S. 98. The upper bay doesn't \"flush\" well, meaning things that wind up in the bay tend to stay there rather than get washed out into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe bay is fed primarily from the northwest by the freshwater Perdido River, but a smaller stream, Eleven Mile Creek, terminates at the north-northeastern tip of the bay.\n\nWhen the paper mill first opened in 1941 as the Florida Pulp and Paper Co., the mill's effluent was discharged directly into Eleven Mile Creek. This continued until 2012, when International Paper completed a 10-mile pipeline that feeds effluent south into a 1,400-acre treatment wetland. There, the effluent meanders through the wetlands over three to four days before eventually flowing into lower Eleven Mile Creek and then to the upper bay.\n\n\"It is important to note that regulatory compliance is demonstrated at the mill site, prior to discharge to the effluent transmission pipeline,\" IP noted in a written statement to the News Journal. \"The wetlands are not relied upon for primary treatment; however, they do add value to the overall system by further refining effluent quality.\"\n\nThe shoreline around the bay is dotted with little communities and subdivisions — Bay Forest, Ramsey Beach, Perdido Terrace and so on — and from his new dock in Ramsey Beach, Steve Swiler can see it all.\n\nA Louisiana native with a big personality, a slight Cajun accent and a passion for LSU football, Swiler and his wife, Connie, like to tie inflatable chairs to their dock and melt into the water.\n\n\"The water, the beauty of it all,\" Swiler said, describing what brought his family to Ramsey Beach five years ago. \"It's just beautiful out here.\"\n\nHe didn't know about the bay's history when he moved in, and it doesn't bother him much. Swiler is president of the area homeowner's association, and he champions the neighborhood as an indisputably great place to live.\n\nHaving a beer on the dock with his neighbor John Schleich, an elder statesman of the community, there was a faint tension as Schleich gave a much bleaker assessment of the bay.\n\nSchleich has lived in Ramsey Beach since 1985, and in the late '80s he was a part of a fleet of Friends of Perdido Bay volunteers who would go out on boats and collect samples at monitoring stations around the bay. He said he remembers local fisherman catching flounder and redfish from their docks, but as time went on they had to take boats out of Perdido Bay to bring in decent hauls.\n\n\"My wife wouldn't swim in it,\" Schleich said of the upper bay. \"She wouldn't eat the fish out of it. We had a son who was 5 or 6 at the time, and she wouldn't let him swim in it.\"\n\nSwiler stressed that he and Connie weren't afraid to go in, and they agreed they sometimes see dolphins breach the flat, glassy surface or bait fish swimming underfoot.\n\nStill, Connie said, \"I would like to know more. If there is pollution, where it comes from and if there's any danger. I'm in it all the time, so I want to know about it.\"\n\nWhat is the paper mill worth to the community?\n\nAt the time a grand jury reviewed Escambia County's air and water quality back in 1999, the permit on Champion International's paper mill was supposed to have expired 12 years prior.\n\n\"Through all 12 years ... Champion has not complied with state water quality standards and permit conditions,\" the grand jury noted in its final report.\n\nNonetheless, the permit was effectively transferred over to a new owner, International Paper, which today is operating on a permit that was issued in 2010 and scheduled to expire in 2015. It has been \"administratively continued\" through at least 2020 — despite the fact the paper mill is still not in compliance.\n\nThe state has proposed charging IP $131,000 in civil penalties, and an additional penalty of $1,000 per day for each day the mill is not in compliance. The DEP and IP remain in negotiations regarding the terms of the consent order.\n\n\"That should be interesting,\" Jackie Lane, president of the Friends of Perdido Bay, said of the negotiations. Whether the state will institute regulations with some proverbial teeth, \"that will be the litmus test.\"\n\nThe 1999 grand jury dedicated a large chunk of its final report to the paper mill, noting its review of DEP records revealed \"neither (previous mill owners) Champion, nor St. Regis, ever fully met state water quality standards. We found instead a pattern of violations, studies and promises to improve, followed by more violations, more studies and more promises and so forth — all of which was accommodated and or constructively approved by (state regulators).\"\n\nThe DEP declined multiple request for an interview with the News Journal, but issued written responses to general questions. The agency noted, \"along with state and federal rules and statutes, permits issued by DEP establish criteria and conditions that help protect and preserve Florida’s air and water quality while also supporting a vibrant economy.\"\n\nThe paper mill received about $14 million in tax breaks as it shed hundreds of jobs\n\nThe mill has historically been the biggest employers in the Cantonment area, and in 1999 it reportedly employed about 1,200 people, provided approximately $80 million in payroll and paid $3.5 million in taxes to Escambia County.\n\nToday, the Pensacola mill employs more than 500 team members and 100 daily onsite contractors, according to International Paper. The total economic impact is estimated to be $300 million, with an annual payroll of $54 million. The mill contributes more than $3.7 million annually in state and local taxes.\n\nThe mill is also a critical customer of local timber growers. A 2017 economic impact study for the Florida Forestry Association says Escambia County's forestry industry creates more than 5,600 jobs and $38 million in state and local taxes.\n\nAccording to records and estimates from the Escambia County Property Appraiser's Office, the mill has seen three tax hefty tax exemptions since 1999 for \"new\" operations.\n\nIn 1999, the mill received a seven-year, approximately $1.2 million Economic Development Ad Valorem Tax Exemption for improvements that increased production by 66,500 tons and added 25 new jobs.\n\nThere was another $1.8 million EDATE in 2001 when IP expanded operations at a McDavid facility, but the exemption was terminated early when IP sold the facility.\n\nIn 2008, IP was granted a 10-year EDATE allowing the company to avoid approximately $11 million in taxes when it expanded production to include a new line for brown rolled paper products.\n\nThe mill is a cultural touchstone for many residents whose fathers and grandfathers worked in the facility, delivered or harvested lumber. Mill staff can often be found at local ribbon cuttings and fundraisers.\n\n\"The mill has been actively involved in the local community, helping International Paper’s goal to protect and improve the lives of team members and the communities where we live and work by focusing on our signature causes of education, hunger, health and wellness, and disaster relief,\" the company's statement said. \"Over the last five years, the IP and the Pensacola Mill has contributed close to $600,000 to organizations in Escambia County. IP provides impactful assistance, face-to-face interactions and offers resources for our community beyond just financial contributions.\"\n\nAn ecological study of Perdido Bay has been a point of contention\n\nResidents, environmental regulators, mill representatives. politicians and scientists have disputed if and how much pollution the mill causes since the 1960s.\n\nIn terms of life in the bay, a National Wetlands Research Center study found the Perdido Bay lost roughly 75% of its seagrass beds between 1940 and 1992 — a decrease from 1,204 acres to 319 acres — more than any other bay on the Gulf Coast, according to the grand jury report.\n\nThe grand jury also noted various sources had reported declines in the quantity and diversity of sea-bed dwelling organisms like marine worms, snails and bivalves.\n\nIn 2014, the county implemented the Eleven Mile Creek Bacteria Pollution Control Plan which includes monthly monitoring at six points along Eleven Mile Creek for bacteria, temperature, pH, specific conductance, dissolved oxygen, dissolved oxygen saturation and turbidity (cloudiness). All of the points are above the paper mill's treatment wetland.\n\nIn 2018, the Friends of Perdido Bay, a community organization dedicated to protecting the watershed, commissioned an ecological survey of the bay.\n\nThe surveyor, a consulting and professional services firm called Cardno, took bottom samples from upper Perdido Bay and nearby Tee and Wicker Lakes, as well as trawled the bodies of water for life.\n\nCardno reported a low abundance of macroinvertebrates at both the bay and lake stations. Trawling produced an abundance of juvenile spot fish, and small quantities of other aquatic life such as brown shrimp, the gulf menhaden and the bay anchovy.\n\nCardno's report also noted that at depths below 1.5 meters (about five feet) the level of dissolved oxygen in upper Perdido Bay decreased rapidly, while the level of salinity increased rapidly.\n\n\"Ponar (bottom) grab samples, when brought to the surface, expressed a strong hydrogen sulfide (H2S) odor,\" the report said. \"Collectively, this information strongly suggests that bottom sediments within the Upper Bay were in a near anoxic state during the period of sampling.\"\n\nPut simply, the surveyors found there was little to no oxygen on the bottom of the bay, which limits the potential for life there.\n\nThe report listed a number of factors that could have contributed to the survey results, from spawning cycles, to the seasonal warming of estuarine waters, to extreme fluctuations in salinity.\n\nThe report advised that a single point-in-time survey was not enough data to draw any conclusions and there needed to be more ongoing studies coupled with historical data to establish any meaningful trends.\n\nStill, the abundance of fish caught has been cited by Escambia County Commissioner Doug Underhill and senior scientist Chips Kirschenfeld as evidence the bay's health is improving, and claims of the bay's death were greatly exaggerated.\n\n\"They remember the way it was 25 years ago,\" Kirschenfeld said. \"I was one of the people making these kinds of statements 25 years, ago. But nature has a wonderful way of healing themselves, if we take away the impacts and problems, which is what we've done over the last 20 years.\"\n\nLane however, noted that the lack of diversity in the bay was troubling, and she said it would be comparable to going into your backyard and finding an abundance of squirrels, but no birds or worms, or bugs, or other life.\n\nShe said that while there's been sampling of the water quality, there was no monitoring of sludge that was settling at the bottom of the bay.\n\n\"That stuff does not break down, it’s going to be there forever,\" she said. \"These mills have never controlled their sludges. They’ve never been made to.\"\n\nSo is Perdido Bay dying or on the mend? New estuary program could provide answers\n\nKirschenfeld said there is no one \"canary in the coal mine\" that could provide a simple litmus test for whether or not Perdido Bay is healthy.\n\nThere have been dozens of studies over the decades, but they've largely been siloed affairs that have ended up on storage shelves.\n\n\"One would have to compile numerous studies that have been been done by DEP, the (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), the Northwest Florida Water Management District and monitoring data that (IP environmental consultants) Nutter and Associates collects. Take all of that data and look through it all, try to come up with a conclusion based on that data.\"\n\nStill, local stakeholders are hopeful a new program may be able to do just that.\n\nIn 2018, the EPA gave Escambia County $2 million in grant funding to establish the Pensacola and Perdido Bays Estuary Program, a collaborative program that will bring together a consortium of local, state and federal experts to try and determine how to protect and restore the two estuary systems.\n\nThe initiative is off to a bit of a rocky start, as the director of the program, Jim Trifilio suddenly announced his resignation.\n\nJessica Bibza, chair of the programs technical committee, said the organization's will soldier on, and hopefully add some clarity to a discussion of Perdido Key she believes has drifted too much into hyperbole.\n\n\"We’re hoping to do an inventory of a bunch of these plans and identify the common themes,\" Bibza said. \"That's where we’re going to start, at the end of the first day, with yet another report that is going to list these priorities and recommend grant projects.\"\n\nShe continued, \"But the next day, what we’re going to need is local government to come forward and say, 'we're going to take on this one and commit to making it happen. We'll have to have the continued commitment from local government, but we got this far with really great support from Escambia and Santa Rosa counties.\"\n\nPart 3: Escambia County confronts pollution sins of the past\n\nAn Escambia County grand jury in 1999 stated in no uncertain terms: the people who were supposed to be protecting the environment were failing.\n\nThe grand jury's 120-page final report accused regulators of ignoring and concealing violations, of bowing to industry and business rather than serving the public, of squandering the area's precious resources for fleeting gain and of mocking and maligning the citizens' groups that tried to fill the void left by government inaction.\n\nThe grand jury made 27 recommendations for improving the state of our environment, which can generally be divided into four categories: policy, monitoring, pollution control and accountability. Most were directed at the Department of Environmental Protection, though some were applicable to local government, state legislators and even the public at large.\n\nThe pollution control recommendations are probably of the most importance to most citizens, and unfortunately, the most complex to gauge and implement.\n\nSins of the past still weigh heavy on Escambia County\n\nHistorically, the mantra for dealing with dirty industry was \"the solution to pollution is dilution.\" It was essentially a theory that we could dump industrial waste into rivers, bays and lakes, and the water bodies were too big and self-replenishing to suffer any substantial harm.\n\nOf course, many now argue that diluting contaminants isn't the same as deleting them, and the accumulation of toxins in our bays, beaches and bayous has done immense harm over time.\n\n\"One of the issues with being one of the oldest communities in Florida is ultimately we saw development ahead of a lot of other areas,\" said Tim Day, Escambia County environmental programs manager. \"Our waterways were where you industrialized, because that's where your transportation routes were.\"\n\nToday, the DEP's list of impaired waterways includes 14 Escambia County water bodies, to include northern and southern Escambia Bay, the northern and middle segments of Pensacola Bay, upper Perdido Bay and many others.\n\nAdditionally, a DEP water quality map indicates most of our local surface waters — bayous Chico, Texar and Marcus, Carpenter Creek, Eleven Mile Creek and many more — fall below state standards and struggle with issues like high bacteria levels, low oxygen levels and excessive nutrient levels.\n\nMany of these issues can be traced back to the many chemical treating plants that have historically dotted the local landscape. We currently have six Superfund sites in Escambia County, highly contaminated former industry sites where decades of processing and manufacturing stained the underlying soil and groundwater with toxins.\n\nOne of the grand jury recommendations in 1999 was that the DEP calculate the \"total maximum daily loads\" for local impaired water bodies — the threshold limits on pollutants for individual water bodies.\n\nBetween 2008 and 2014, the DEP developed TMDLs for the Bayou Chico Watershed, Escambia Bay and Perdido Bay, Eleven Mile, Ten Mile and Carpenter's creeks and others.\n\nIn 2011, the DEP and numerous partners completed the Bayou Chico Basin Management Action Plan, more than 50 projects intended to achieve restoration of the watershed, including Jones Creek, Jackson Creek, Maggie's Ditch, Bayou Chico Beach and Sanders Beach.\n\n\"To a certain extent, we do still deal with those legacy contaminants,\" said Chips Kirschenfeld, the county's senior scientist and head of the Department of Natural Resources Management.\n\n\"For example, one of the projects we're working on now is to clean up the contaminated sediments in Bayou Chico. That's one of the BP-funded projects. Those contaminants go back 100 years probably, and here we are today, we're going to be spending $20 million probably before it's all done, maybe more, to try to correct those sins of the past.\"\n\nA 2018 annual report on the statewide status of BMAP, TMDL and other initiatives, reported that from August 2011 through December 2018, 83 Bayou Chico projects had been reported as completed. The initiatives have ranged from dredging, to stormwater improvements at nearby parks, to an environmental symposium at the University of West Florida.\n\nNonetheless, beach advisories — health warnings issued in response to elevated levels of bacteria, algal blooms and other problems — are used as a gauge for BMAP efficacy. The annual report indicates that every year between Jan. 1, 2010, and June 30, 2018, Bayou Chico Beach exceeded the allowable 20 days of beach advisories per year.\n\nSanders Beach exceeded the number of advisory days allowed twice in the 7.5-year span.\n\nLinda Young, the former director of the Florida Clean Water Network, has repeatedly sued at the state and federal level for tougher water quality regulations. She believes that for all the talk of standards and protections, regulators aren't proactive enough at preventing problems, or tough enough on polluters to solve problems when they are identified.\n\nFor all the recent activity to battle algae blooms in South Florida, the problem was a product of years and years of inaction.\n\nShe said for regulators to take any meaningful action at a polluted watershed, \"It has to have pretty much collapsed.\"\n\nEPA data shows we still release more toxins than almost anywhere else in America\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's annual Toxics Release Inventory, the Pensacola metro area currently has the country's 12th highest rate of toxic releases per square mile.\n\nThe vast majority of these releases come from a handful of heavy industries in Cantonment: Ascend Performance Materials, a nylon manufacturing plant; the International Paper paper mill; and Gulf Power's Crist electric plant.\n\nThose industries, along with a few others, release about 35 million pounds of waste each year. According to officials, upward of 95% of chemicals are treated before the waste is released, but emissions still contain potentially harmful substances such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, methanol and formaldehyde.\n\nWater emissions may also contain nitrogen and phosphorus, nutrient-rich materials that can feed algae blooms.\n\nIn 1999, the grand jury recommended that DEP attempt to cut down on pollution by refusing to grant any new expanded or relocated waste discharges in Escambia County.\n\nWhile DEP has permitted two new discharges in the intervening 20 years, the agency reports there has been a net decrease in discharge points.\n\nThere were 11 permitted discharges within Escambia County in 1999, five of which are no longer in operation.\n\nNaval Air Station Pensacola connected its wastewater treatment facility to the Emerald Coast Utilities Authority's in 2009; the Main Street Wastewater Treatment Plant was relocated in 2012; and the respective discharges of Saufley Field Sewage Treatment Plant, Westinghouse Electric Company LLC and Nitrous Oxide Corp. have all been closed or diverted into other wastewater treatment systems.\n\nThe two new discharges are a new central water reclamation facility that was permitted in 2007 to replace the Main Street plant, and a new ECUA subaqueous cleaning line for potable water mains.\n\nFive of the remaining dischargers have improved their treatment processes since 1999, according to the DEP (the department is currently processing a new permit for the sixth discharger, the town of Century).\n\nInternational Paper discharged its effluent directly into Eleven Mile Creek at the time of the grand jury report, but has since installed an approximately 1,300-acre wetland intended to filter its effluent before it hits the river.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports International Paper has been in violation of the Clean Water Act for 11 of the past 12 quarters.\n\nIn regards to Ascend, the DEP reports it issued an administrative order in 2001 that prompted Solutia to eliminate the surface water discharge of wastewater from multiple points within its facility, resulting in a non-process wastewater only discharge to surface water.\n\nHowever, Ascend Performance Materials has been in noncompliance with the Clean Air Act for eight of the past 12 quarters and in noncompliance with the Clean Water Act for seven of the past 12 quarters, according to the EPA.\n\nGulf Power's 2018 permit included increased monitoring requirements. Also, Gulf Power is a reuse customer for ECUA, using approximately 6 million gallons per day of reuse water in their air scrubber system, according to DEP.\n\nThe Crist Mill had two quarters of noncompliance in the past three years, according to EPA data.\n\nECUA's respective treatment plants are at Pensacola Beach and Bayou Marcus, Gulf Power's Crist Plant, Ascend Performance Materials LLC and International Paper.\n\nRussell Edgar, the now-retired assistant state attorney who led the grand jury investigation in 1999, said part of the problem with tracking the health issues caused by pollution is that they are hard to isolate from other causes.\n\n\"There have been multiple studies at (the University of West Florida) about this issue,\" Edgar said. \"They were focused largely on health issues, which are very difficult to measure because of the way people move around and because of other factors such as personal habits, diets and so forth, it's hard to tell just what connection there is between the pollution here and the health outcomes.\"\n\nUWF and numerous health agencies conducted health studies about the effect of pollution\n\nAfter the grand jury report, UWF — with federal funding and the assistance of the Department of Health, Florida State University, the University of South Florida and the Georgia Institute of Technology — studied the local impacts of pollution.\n\nThe studies, which stretched from 2002 to 2009, included an analysis of whether proximity to discharge sites affected human health outcomes. A summary of the study noted, \"this study did not find clear evidence for an influence of proximity to emission sites on 'cumulative' health at the zip code level.\"\n\nStudies also looked at the pollution of soil in public places such as parks, playgrounds and sports fields at 126 locations in Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. While they found elevated levels of toxins near some legacy pollution sites, they generally found the ground didn't pose a health hazard.\n\nStill, the report noted that ZIP codes with high incidences of specific outcomes like cardiac disease, lung cancer, asthma and pneumonia tended to have higher proximity to emission sources. The report recommended that the specific causes of these higher health risks — particularly in infants, the elderly, the black community and the poor — needed to be further investigated and addressed.\n\nThat follow-up work hasn't occurred.\n\nAdditionally, the universities used hair samples to measure the mercury levels in women of child-bearing age. They found about 95 of the 602 women sampled (some 16%) had hair mercury levels exceeding the U.S. EPA's advisory level. Of the 95, roughly 60% had eaten more than three seafood meals in the prior 30 days.\n\nThe Department of Health launched a campaign to raise awareness of fish consumption advisories that included billboards, news releases and wallet cards, but over the years, those efforts have tapered off to postings on the DOH website.\n\nCurrently, young children and women of child-bearing age are urged not to eat freshwater fish, with the exception of a handful of species, more than once a month to limit mercury exposure.\n\nEdgar noted, \"we still have problems with the water, and anybody who fishes or goes out on the water knows this.\"\n\nStormwater and sewage improvement\n\nStormwater runoff was also identified in the 1999 grand jury report, because unlike industrial waste, the trash and debris that rain washes off of our yards and streets receives no treatment.\n\nIn 2000, the city of Pensacola adopted a stormwater management program, and in 2001 adopted a stormwater utility to fund infrastructure improvements.\n\nOver the past five years, the city has spent almost $8.7 million in budgeted capital improvements throughout the city. Additionally, the city has invested about $14 million in state and federal grant funds on projects such as Bill Gregory Stormwater Park and Corinne Jones Park. Another $10.4 million in grants have gone to emergency repair projects.\n\nOn Escambia County's end of things, the Natural Resources Department has received an average of about $1 million a year in grant funding annually over the past decade.\n\nThe funding has allowed the department to do some innovative and experimental projects. The Central Office Complex at 3363 West Park Place is a point of pride for the staff, and features a green roof covered in plants, a pervious pavement parking lot designed to \"drink\" rainwater and a nationally certified in-house laboratory.\n\nThe grant funding is coupled with about $125.4 million in BP oil spill funding that's already been earmarked for the county through RESTORE, Natural Resources Damage Assessment and National Fish and Wildlife Foundation grants.\n\nThe county has spent about $179.8 million in Local Option Sales Taxes on drainage and dirt road projects, including a major initiative with the ECUA to install stormwater ponds, paved roads and other improvements in the Beach Haven community.\n\nSo far, $82.9 million in Natural Resources Damage Assessment funds have been awarded to the county for 17 projects. Most of the projects are quality of life improvements such as $4.4 million for boat ramps at Mahogany Mill, Navy Point and Galvez Landing; $2.7 for artificial reef creation and restoration and $10.8 million for a 3.4-acre park at Innerarity Point.\n\nBrent Wipf, manager of the county's Water Quality and Land Management Division, said that work done over the years to reduce and remove point sources of discharges cleared the way for a lot of the work.\n\nThe 1999 grand jury report noted that, \"In southern Escambia County, ground water contamination is substantial and has resulted in a well construction moratorium, well closures and water filtration. More than one-half of the county's public supply wells have been contaminated with dry cleaning solvents, pesticides or petroleum products.\"\n\nThe Department of Health in Escambia County, the ECUA, the DEP and Escambia County have partnered on an array of programs to remediate the issues.\n\nThe Escambia County DOH administers the Petroleum Restoration Program for seven Northwest Florida counties. The program, funded by a percentage of Florida fuel sales, allows the DOH to remove and clean up abandoned fuel tanks left behind by shuttered gas stations.\n\n\"A lot are on old sites that have been contaminated since '70s, '80s and early '90s,\" said Gregory Berrian, environmental health director of the Escambia County DOH. \"The state realized they didn’t know where all these storage tanks were, so they created a few programs that say pretty much, ‘If you tell us where the tank is and if you’ve had any sort of leak or spill, we’ll cover the cost of cleaning it up.\"\n\nBerrian said in the '90s, there were about 1,400 eligible sites in Escambia County. Now that number is down to around 290.\n\nDOH has also been working with the county and ECUA to help homes on environmentally sensitive lands — shorelines, wetlands and the like — connect to sewer lines and safely abandon their septic tanks.\n\nECUA Executive Director Stephen Sorrell said, \"we’ve been spending in the range of about $30 million a year for various capital improvement projects. About $8 million of that’s going toward the improvements of the sanitary sewer system in order to upgrade some of the older infrastructure.”\n\nThe capital improvement funds have gone toward large-scale conversion projects in Beach Haven, Navy Point and other areas.\n\nECUA Director of Communications and Government Affairs Timothy Haag said that roughly 60% to 70% of the utility's customers are hooked up to sewer.\n\n\"We have prioritized areas that are close to surface waters and areas where the Health Department has indicated there is a health concern,\" Sorrell said. \"We prioritize those areas and try to address them first, and we’ve done a pretty good job of it. The areas where the septic tanks still remain are primarily where we don’t have a wastewater or sewage collection system.”\n\nHe noted that in those areas, ECUA had to lay pipe to connect to its wastewater treatment facilities. The cost can range from around $50 per foot to about $400 a foot in areas like Pensacola Beach.\n\n\"Millions of dollars sounds like a lot of money, but it doesn’t go very far at that rate,\" Sorrell said. \"Our issue is really pretty simple. We don’t have the ability to collect any tax money, and we get very little grant money or anything because we are a special district. About every bit of money we get has to come comes from our ratepayers, then we have to try to reapply these funds to make these improvements without overcharging ratepayers.\"\n\nSorrell said in this issue and most others, \"There's more need than there are dollars to do them.\"\n\nPart 4: Is Escambia County holding air, water polluters accountable?\n\nJessica Baker balanced precariously on the lip of a small bridge, taking a moment to steady herself against the railing.\n\nWith nothing but a sheer two-story drop in front of her, she slowly lowered a flat, black and white disk into the stream beneath her until it disappeared. She called back what she observed to Barbara Albrecht, who jotted it down on her clipboard, then handed Baker the next testing implement.\n\nIt was a balmy Sunday in September, and the two women had volunteered their day to collect samples from urban watersheds throughout Escambia County.\n\nAlbrecht, a marine biologist, has been doing the work for decades as a member of the Florida Bream Fishermen's Association. The citizens' group has been sampling local waters for 50 years, and currently monitors at 48 stations throughout the county.\n\nThat Sunday, the group was doing its \"urban run,\" and Baker had volunteered to help.\n\nHistorically, our local water bodies such as Bayou Chico, Bayou Texar, Carpenter Creek and others have been polluted by contaminants from heavy industry. Today, stormwater is one of the biggest threats. When it washes off roads and yards, it often carries sediment, nitrogen, phosphorus, bacteria, oil and grease, trash, pesticides and metals that get deposited directly into the water with no filtration.\n\n\"This system at one time supported all kinds of people, all kinds of communities,\" Albrecht said. \"People swam and fished, and you used to be able to take a boat all the way down. We've lost the beauty of nature. Nature's hanging on, we just need to help her a little.\"\n\nA grand jury reviewed Escambia County's environment in 1999, and issued 27 recommendations, many of them dealing with the overarching policies that guide how regulators monitor and regulate industry and the environment.\n\nIt identified stormwater as a major concern. It also recommended that the county step up its monitoring efforts. The report noted that after Champion International, the then-owners of the Cantonment paper mill, settled a pollution lawsuit with property owners, the state dialed back monitoring efforts in the area considerably.\n\nAfterward, \"Northwest District of (DEP) then stopped almost all ambient water quality monitoring in the Perdido System, and elsewhere in the area, even though the mill was visibly and obviously polluting Eleven Mile Creek,\" the grand jury report said. \"Biologists were assigned to other duties, the Pensacola lab was dismantled, and the task of monitoring was given to the Northwest Florida Water Management District.\"\n\nBecause the district was not provided funding to conduct monitoring, the work was left to \"Champion, its paid consultants and to volunteers from the Bream Fishermen's Association.\"\n\nSince then, local government has stepped in to fill the void, but there are still concerns about some of the local monitoring efforts, how much data is available to the public and local environmental policy.\n\nHow has water quality monitoring improved since the grand jury report?\n\nCurrently, there are 14 local waters on the DEP's list of impaired waters, and most of our watershed has high levels of bacteria, nutrients and other problem contaminants.\n\nUnless you've lived here long enough to know the area's history, you likely would have no clue about the sorry state of our water.\n\nThe Department of Health in Escambia County issues water quality advisories on its website, but does not typically post signs or other information at problem sites.\n\nDr. John Lanza, director of the local DOH, said the department only monitors for enterococci — a bacteria that typically isn't dangerous, but that can indicate other harmful contaminants.\n\n\"Enterococci is going to change by the minute,\" Lanza said. \"Depending on which way the wind is blowing the tide, what you sampled a minute ago is going to be different from what you sampled a minute ago. It's going to change again if it rains 10 minutes later. Unless you have continuous sampling, you really can't know what's happening at any particular moment, you just know what's there in the history.\"\n\nThe DOH monitors 13 high-traffic shorelines through the state's \"Healthy Beaches\" program established back in 2000.\n\nEscambia County conducts general water quality monitoring at 48 stations around the county, as well as conducting project-specific monitoring at 14 locations including the Pensacola Bay and Navy Point living shorelines, Bill Gregory Stormwater Park, the Jones Swamp Floodplain expansion and others.\n\nStill, there's no one handy place where the data is posted in a way for citizens to easily understand and make sound health decisions.\n\n\"There's a lot of information,\" said Gregory Berrian, DOH's environmental health director. \"It takes research. It takes someone to want to know about where they live and where they’re playing.\"\n\nA 2016 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency study noted there have been more than 450 studies of the Pensacola Bay system in recent history. Many of them exist in hard copy rather than online, making them difficult to compile.\n\nThe study notes there has been \"no long-term, multi-metric, and consistently-conducted monitoring effort to determine water quality trends in all but a few parameters.\" It noted that surface water condition for the system had been ranked in the past as between \"fair\" and \"good,\" but \"all chemical water quality judgments to date are based on an incomplete database and their conclusions are subject to wide interpretation.\"\n\nThe report features a wealth of information on the local sediment, seagrass, sea life and other subjects, but concludes, bottom line, that \"preventing further chemical and biological deterioration is an achievable goal but pragmatically any measurable improvement will occur incrementally over the long-term in the shadow of the increasing effects of climate change.\"\n\nAlbrecht argues there is much that can be done to start making improvements in the here and now, but it's not happening on the necessary scale.\n\nFor instance, in a recent newsletter, the Bream Fishermen's Association said that the new $417 million bridge over Pensacola Bay will create about 30 acres of hardened surface on each of its two spans. The organization calculated a one-inch rain event will generate 814,500 gallons of stormwater per span that will spill directly into Pensacola Bay with no form of treatment.\n\n\"These (water quality) problems are from 20, 30, 50 years ago, but we are still making the exact same mistakes, so they are going to be problems for your children and your grandchildren,\" Albrecht said.\n\nHow has air quality and local policy improved in the last 20 years?\n\nThe 1999 grand jury report said that the area's ozone levels \"are among the highest in the state and have been for many years.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of Environmental Protection said in a statement that in the last two decades since then, the air quality in Escambia County has improved significantly due to reductions in emissions of several key pollutants.\n\n\"In particular, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in Escambia County — the majority of which are from the Crist Electric Generating Plant — have dropped by 98 percent in the last two decades,\" the statement said. \"This drop in emissions is largely due to the installation of the wet scrubber at the Crist plant in late 2009 to help control SO2 emissions.\"\n\nThe state operates two air quality monitors in Escambia County that currently measure ozone, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and SO2.\n\nEscambia County operates 13 air quality monitoring locations, largely focused around landfills and concrete crushing plants.\n\nThe main impetus for the program were concerns of residents who were worried they were being poisoned by gasses and dust from the many waste and recycling facilities that surrounded their neighborhood.\n\n\"Historically, we never did air quality monitoring, but when it became a hot button issue three years ago with the Rolling Hills facility and the hydrogen sulfide, the concrete crushing and the potential for silica dust and fine particulates, the board asked us to start,\" said the county's top scientist, Chips Kirschenfeld, director of the Department of Natural Resources Management. \"That was a whole new field for this department that rose out of the desire from County Commissioners, and we had the knowledge and the background to start.\"\n\nKirschenfeld said he, Tim Day, environmental programs manager, and Brent Wipf, manager of the Water Quality and Land Management Division, were brought on staff in the wake of the grand jury report to help the county start addressing its environmental legacy.\n\nHe added that as recommended by the grand jury, the county had started acquiring sensitive lands for protections. Additionally, the state expanded the Environmental Resource Permitting program — which regulates almost all changes to the landscape that affect surface water flows — to Northwest Florida.\n\n\"To me, one of the first things that came out of this (grand jury report) was the push for local ordinances and rules changes — from protecting wetlands and environmentally sensitive lands, to well head protections, to stormwater improvements, a lot of different regulations went into place,\" Kirschenfeld said. \"And along with that, the county made the decision that they needed professional environmental staff, which they didn’t have at the time.\"\n\nHow has accountability improved in the last 20 years?\n\nThe Northwest District of the DEP declined to be interviewed by the News Journal, but answered general inquires in a written statement.\n\nOne of the key passages of the 1999 grand jury report was that, \"We find that the Northwest District of the Department of Environmental Protection failed to properly implement and enforce the environmental laws, rules and regulations. The district office succumbed to political, economic, and other pressures, allowing regulated business, industries and individuals to pollute the area’s air and water. The district director, and others acting on his behalf, ignored and concealed environmental violations against the sound advice of staff employees.\"\n\nIn a response, the DEP noted that \"DEP leadership at both the district and agency levels have changed since 1999 ... (but) the department’s mission to protect Florida natural resources is ongoing. The department continues to collect, study and analyze data about our changing environment in order to make informed, science-based decisions that ensure our natural resources will be protected for generations to come.\"\n\nNonetheless, an array of local environmentalists have decried the current iteration of the DEP as a \"permitting agency\" that focuses far more on paperwork than field work.\n\nHistorically, dischargers have conducted their own monitoring and collected their own samples, which are sent to the DEP for approval.\n\n\"The polluter has always had to take samples on a regular basis,\" said Linda Young, founder of the Florida Clean Water Network. \"When their effluent is leaving the pipe, they sample it every so often and take measures of the various pollutants. They would do that themselves, but in the old days, DEP would show up unexpected and do samples and check receiving waters' conditions to see what was happening there.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Over the years, it has got weaker and weaker and weaker. (Polluters) they go out and do their own thing, and DEP might spot check, they might not. It’s pretty much a self-regulating, fox-guarding-the-henhouse kind of a thing.\"\n\nWhen dischargers are found in non-compliance with regulations, one would assume DEP would have authority to crack the whip on violators, say \"comply or else\" and resolve noncompliance matters quickly.\n\nIn reality, it is more of a push and pull, where industries can apply for \"site specific alternative criteria\" that loosen regulations and make it easier for them to comply, negotiate over consent orders that dictate the standards they'll be held to and embark on lengthy appeals processes to fight DEP rulings.\n\nWhile local advocates recognize there needs to be due process, they point out that it's everyday citizens and tax payers who suffer during these drawn out administrative battles.\n\n\"People think, 'What are these stupid environmentalists screaming about?' \" Young said. \"It's the water you are drinking. The water you are bathing in. It's fundamental to all of us. It's a huge deal, and it's a travesty. You need to know this, and you have a right to know this, because it's not going to get any better if no one is doing anything to make it better.\"\n\nPart 5: Sweeping reforms were proposed, but few came. What happened?\n\nIt was a \"stick of dynamite,” the judge said.\n\nIn one clear, concise, comprehensive document, a grand jury had researched and cataloged Escambia County's environmental sins and laid them bare for all to review.\n\nIt was a powerful, explosive read. Among other things, the 1999 grand jury report recommended the local head of the Department of Environmental Protection be terminated for ignoring and concealing violations, and proposed that dereliction of duty by a public officer be designated a criminal offense.\n\nStill, the question to John Kuder, then the chief judge of Florida's First Judicial Circuit, was whether the report would blow open the current regime of inaction and enabling, or create a flash fire that quickly burned away into a puff of smoke.\n\nConvening a grand jury to review the factors affecting Escambia County's air and water quality — and regulators' efficacy in protecting it — had been an easy sell when then State Attorney Curtis Golden approached Kuder with the proposal in 1998.\n\n\"I've lived here all of my adult life,\" Kuder said from his downtown Pensacola office some 20 years later. \"I can remember when there were plenty of fish to catch, plenty of scallops, all kinds of wildlife and fauna. So many species I used to enjoy are gone. ... My own personal experience was exactly what I saw here (in the report).\"\n\nAfter Kuder agreed to impanel the grand jury, Assistant State Attorney Russell Edgar set about to gather information and testimony from scores of different biologists, chemists, engineers, businessmen, environmentalists, regulators and records.\n\n“What I did was present this testimony to the grand jury and anyone else who wanted to hear it over a period of about a year,” Edgar said. “During that time, I went to the outfalls of the paper mill and all the plants and walked them. I got a boat and went up the rivers to see the discharges in the bays. I overflew the area in a helicopter and basically studied the maps and the charts and the figures of what had happened and historically reviewed how all this began.”\n\nHe continued, “It became evident that we had wonderful resources here, but the lack of any planning whatsoever caused the degradation of our natural resources, and this resulted in permanent damage and very costly consequences to the local people.”\n\nThe grand jury's final report was damning, offering 27 recommendations for local and state regulators to start reversing the harm to our environment. A finding that particularly enraged the public was an assertion that the Northwest Florida District of the DEP had \"succumbed to political, economic, and other pressures,\" and then-district director, Bobby Cooley, had \"ignored and concealed environmental violations against the sound advice of staff.\"\n\nSome 20 years removed from the report's release, Kuder said, \"The response was immediately favorable. It was favorable because of its scope, its detail and the common sense of its findings and recommendations. It just seemed to make sense based on all of the findings.\"\n\nStill, local and state officials responded to the report with denial and denouncements. Elected officials scoffed at the suggestion they put corporations ahead of citizens, and environmental regulators were adamant they knew best how to safeguard our natural resources.\n\nA defiant DEP administration said it would take the grand jury's recommendations under consideration, but ultimately refused to terminate Cooley and balked at implementing many of the sweeping changes recommended in the report.\n\n\"After the report was issued and presented publicly, there were a group of people, chamber of commerce people and others, who came to the aid of the local director who had served their interest and not the public's,\" Edgar said. \"They criticized the report and took out ads in the paper against it, chastised me for it and so forth. I even had a County Commissioner who accused me of just doing it because I wanted to run for office, which was just laughable.\"\n\nThe then-head of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, David Struhs, told the News Journal at the time, “I would not say the grand jury’s work was an endorsement, but it was a vindication that the work done there is complex,\" adding, \"the people who work there work for me. They don’t work for a citizen’s panel impaneled by a state attorney.”\n\nWithin a few years, Struhs had left the DEP for a job in International Paper's corporate administration.\n\nIn the months after the grand jury report, the News Journal noted that few of the initiatives gained much traction. In recent years, a lot of the progress that's been made on environmental issues is thanks to a windfall of BP oil spill settlement funding.\n\nKuder, speaking of the time after the report, said, “When there were people and organizations that tried to do something ... they could get information. They couldn’t get action. You can do all the studies in the world, but unless you can put that into the hands of people who can transform the community, the result is a book sitting on the shelf. That’s where it started to slowly disintegrate.\"\n\nThus, it now falls to a few to try to fight for what's right in the face of inaction and indifference.\n\n\"A lot of very good people in this community spend all of their spare time trying to get the right thing done and not being able to,\" Kuder said.\n\nExpressing what's perhaps his biggest disappointment, the judge said he didn't feel as if the voting public had followed the recommendation that they become more knowledgeable and involved about the environment concerning environmental issues and demand that their elected officials do the same.\n\n\"If you want things to happen the way you believe they should, exercise your right to vote, know who the candidate you support is working for, what source of revenue is funding that campaign,\" Kuder said. \"You can have someone who says I'm for the environment, and I'm committed to cleaning up air pollution, water pollution, ground water pollution. But you better know who that man or woman really is, and you certainly should know from whom their support is generated.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/17"}]}

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Succession” drops viewers into the high-stakes world of running a media empire and all the top-secret deals, attempted coups and shocking scandals that comes with it.\n\nThe actors and creators of the award-winning series, which will compete for more statues at Monday’s Emmy Awards, insist that the characters are inspired by a long list of family-run dynastic enterprises – both past and present. Showrunner Jesse Armstrong said in one behind-the-scenes interview that the writers pulled from “famous media families like the Hearsts, to modern-day Redstone, John Malone, Robert Fitz of Comcast, Murdoch, and Robert and Rebekah Mercer, who founded Breitbart.”\n\nBut of all the influences, the fictional Roys, led by patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox), who plays the CEO of media company and entertainment conglomerate Waystar Royco, seem to overlap most with the real-life Murdochs, the family of Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n(Major spoilers ahead from season three of “Succession.”)\n\nA patriarchal family-run business\n\nActor Brian Cox in \"Succession\" Season 3. Macall Polay/HBO\n\nThe premise of the series, which airs on HBO, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, is practically ripped from the Murdoch playbook.\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, in 2018. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLogan Roy, a ruthless dealmaker and a friend of presidents, certainly possesses a Murdoch-ian vibe.\n\nRupert Murdoch grew the small newspaper company that he inherited from his father in 1952 into one of the most powerful conservative media empires in history. News Corp, with a market cap of $13.50 billion, is one of the most influential companies on the planet.\n\nHe always intended to pass down his company to one of his children, but the 91-year-old has never named a successor.\n\nFamily structure\n\nJeremy Strong and Brian Cox in Season 2 of \"Succession.\" Graeme Hunter/HBO\n\nLike Roy, Murdoch has several children from two marriages.\n\nPrudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business, so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that ensnares her siblings.\n\nRupert Murdoch’s oldest son from his second marriage is Lachlan Murdoch, who rose quickly through the ranks and became chairman and chief executive of News Ltd in 1997.\n\nAt the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” Then, in 2005 he abruptly quit after a battle with Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014.\n\nThe family also includes Rupert Murdoch’s youngest son, James Murdoch, who dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label.\n\nJames Murdoch joined News Corporation and was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent after Lachlan Murdoch quit in 2005. But he stepped down in 2011 after he was engulfed in a phone hacking scandal. After several years of hiatus, he rejoined the family business before ultimately resigned in 2020, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”\n\nElisabeth Murdoch is the only daughter of their father’s second marriage.\n\n“She’s very savvy, very cunning. She is perhaps the most like Rupert,” New York Times writer Jim Rutenberg says of Elisabeth in the new CNN Original Series “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence,” which premieres on CNN September 25 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nRupert Murdoch flanked by his sons Lachlan (left) and James (right) in 2016. LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRupert Murdoch has been dismissive of her attempts to take the throne, saying she needs to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company, Sky High author Mathew Horsman said in the series.\n\nIn 2000, she left the family business and founded one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies.\n\nOn “Succession,” Logan Roy has four children. Eldest Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) is mostly removed from the business and, in the most recent season, set his eyes on the presidency. Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) initially sits as the ostensible heir apparent to his father, but after a series of blows, he falls from his father’s graces.\n\nRoy family youngest, quick-witted Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), has had a hard time proving himself worthy of the top spot. Sarah Snook’s Siobhan (or Shiv), meanwhile, has the skills and her father’s favor (even when they’re at bitter odds), but has been met resistance.\n\nThe media empire and network\n\nAshley Zukerman and Sarah Snook on the set of ATN in \"Succession.\"\n\n“Succession’s” Waystar Royco and the Murdoch’s News Corp. have more than a few points of overlap.\n\nOn “Succession,” Waystar Royco’s assets include conservative cable news network ATN, the show’s version of Fox News.\n\nThroughout the series, Logan Roy speaks with the president and his advisers about the network’s coverage of the White House and flexes their access.\n\nFox News is a tool of influence for Rupert Murdoch, Jonathan Mahler, who co-wrote “How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World,” says in “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence.”\n\n“Rupert had always fantasized about having a close relationship with an American President,” says Mahler.\n\nMajor scandal\n\nJeremy Strong and Brian Cox testify about the cruiseship scandal in \"Succession.\" Zach Dilgard/HBO\n\nIn Season 2 of “Succession,” news leaks that Waystar’s cruise ship division buried internal reports of sexual harassment, assault and possibly murder. The scandal forced Logan Roy and his son Kendall Roy to testify before a US senate subcommittee – another strike in Kendall’s pursuit of power.\n\nJames and Rupert Murdoch speak at a Parliamentary Select Committee about the UK phone hacking scandal in 2011. ANDY BUCHANAN/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe debacle shares similarities with the News Corp.’s hacking scandal in 2011. The company’s British newspaper, News of the World, came under scrutiny when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals, celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. Like a mirror image of the show, Rupert Murdoch, alongside his son James, testified before Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\n\nIn the fallout, James gave up his title as executive chairman of News Corp’s UK publishing unit.\n\n“You would imagine, in a situation like this, a father’s instinct might be to protect his son, but James is really thrown under the bus by his father,” said Mahler. “It’s a humiliating and devastating period for him.”\n\nSelling off the empire\n\nKieran Culkin, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Brian Cox in the finale of season three of \"Succession.\" Graeme Hunter/HBO\n\nBoth Rupert and Logan pulled off a move that left people stunned: Selling off their self-made empires.\n\nIn the finale of Season 3, Logan announces his plan to sell Waystar Royco to streaming company GoJo and give tech founder Lukas Matsson control of the company.\n\n“This is the best moment to sell. If I don’t do the best deal at any given point, what’s the point of anything? I don’t get out, I leave $5 billion on the table,” Logan told his children. “Make your own pile. This is an opportunity for you kids to get an education in real life.”\n\nRupert also chose to cash out in 2018, selling off most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.\n\n“Once the Disney deal closed, Fox was left a shell of its former self. Gone was the movie studio, gone was the cable networks like FX. What was left was the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, and Fox News – the thing that Rupert cares about more than anything,” Matthew Belloni, former editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter and founding partner of Puck News, says in the Murdoch series.\n\nRudenberg says this move was seen as a no-confidence vote in his children.\n\n“By making his family the business, and the business his family, Rupert left his family just as broken up as his company was when he sold to Disney,” said Rutenberg. “It was ripped apart by this decades-long battle for succession which, at the same time, was a zero-sum seeming battle for their father’s love.”\n\nToday, Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and his father serves as co-chairman. Both James and Elisabeth have left the family business.\n\nThe future of Logan’s children is very uncertain as the series heads into its fourth season.\n\nA premiere date has not been announced.", "authors": ["Janelle Davis"], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/uk/david-attenborough-knighted-gbr-scli-intl/index.html", "title": "David Attenborough receives a second knighthood | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nDavid Attenborough has received a second knighthood for services to television broadcasting and conservation.\n\nThe prestigious Knight Grand Cross was bestowed upon the 96-year-old naturalist by the Prince of Wales, himself a passionate campaigner for the environment.\n\nDavid Attenborough poses for a picture after receiving his second knighthood.

too much for some people’s liking.\n\nSeason 5 debuted Wednesday and it was controversial even before it premiered.\n\nThat’s because former British Prime Minister Sir John Major complained that a scene purporting to show him and then Prince Charles (played by Dominic West) discussing a plot to oust his mother Queen Elizabeth from the throne when Major was in office was a “barrel load of malicious nonsense.”\n\nEsteemed actress Dame Judi Dench cosigned in a letter to The Times, calling on Netflix add a disclaimer to the series.\n\n“No one is a greater believer in artistic freedom than I, but this cannot go unchallenged,” Dench wrote. “Despite this week stating publicly that The Crown has always been a “fictionalised drama” the programme makers have resisted all calls for them to carry a disclaimer at the start of each episode.”\n\nBut the series does feature some history that is factual - even if it does have the tendency to spice things up here and there.\n\nHere are some examples, subtle and substantive, of where the show leans into actual history.\n\nPrince Charles and Princess Diana’s marriage misery\n\nDominic West as Prince Charles and Elizabeth Debicki as Diana in Season 5 of \"The Crown.\" Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nThe series kicks off with the beloved royal couple heading off on what was supposed to be a romantic holiday, but doesn’t end up that way.\n\nGranted we have no idea if a young Prince William and Prince Harry actually did ally with their mom over their dad on vacation activities, but the show does a pretty good job of documenting how unhappy Princess Diana and then Prince Charles were.\n\nThey cover it all - from Andrew Morton’s bombshell “Diana” book (which she cooperated on from behind the scenes) in 1996 to the utter cringe that was the leaking of then Prince Charles and his now wife Camilla’s salacious phone conversations that caused a huge controversy because of their infidelity.\n\nOne senses that as tortured as it’s portrayed on the screen, it was even worse for the couple in real life.\n\nThe fire at Windsor Castle\n\nImelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth II surveys the damage of a devastating fire in \"The Crown\" Season 5 Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nDuring the speech she made to mark her 40th anniversary on the throne, Queen Elizabeth makes a speech about the year 1992 being her “annus horribilis.”\n\n“1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” she said.\n\nOne of the reasons she had such an awful year was because of a fire at Windsor Castle that destroyed more than 100 rooms.\n\nThe fire is not a major storyline, but a scene showing Imelda Staunton as Queen Elizabeth surveying the destruction seems to serve as a symbol of the troubles in her family and - by extension - her country.\n\nThe friendship between Prince Phillip and Penny Knatchbull\n\nJonathan Pryce as Prince Phillip and Natascha McElhone as Penny Knatchbull in Season 5 of \"The Crown.\" Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nPenny Knatchbull married the godson of the Duke of Edinburgh, but her friendship with Prince Phillip was solid in a way that went beyond that.\n\nThe series features Prince Phillip stepping in to help Knatchbull after a family tragedy which leads to years of them growing closer.\n\nShe became “the second-most important woman in the Duke of Edinburgh’s life — a constant confidante, loyal companion and ‘keeper of secrets’” Ingrid Seward wrote in her 2020 book “Prince Philip Revealed.”\n\n“The Crown” makes a point to show that the much older Prince Phillip was not romantically involved with Knatchbull, but rather bonded over their common interests like carriage riding.\n\nThat dress\n\nElizabeth Debicki as Princess Diana in the now famous \"revenge dress.\" Keith Bernstein/Netflix\n\nAfter Prince Charles admitted during an ITN documentary in 1994 that he had not been loyal to Princess Diana, she stepped out in a black, off the shoulder Christina Stambolian dress that was dubbed “the revenge dress.”\n\nThe now iconic scene is recreated in the show by Elizabeth Debicki, who is winning raves for her portrayal of Princess Diana.", "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/17/entertainment/netflix-the-crown-john-major-intl-scli/index.html", "title": "Netflix defends 'The Crown' after former prime minister describes ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nNetflix has defended its hit show “The Crown” as a “fictional dramatisation,” after former British Prime Minister John Major slammed its depictions of his time in office as “damaging and malicious fiction” and a “barrel-load of nonsense.”\n\nMajor, who was prime minister from 1990 to 1997, responded on Saturday to rumors in UK media that one plotline of the new season sees King Charles III – then the Prince of Wales – hinting that he wanted Major’s support for his mother’s abdication.\n\nAnother plot line is said to include disparaging conversations between Major – played by Jonny Lee Miller – and his wife, Norma, concerning the Queen and the royal family.\n\nFormer Prime Minister John Major is seen in London in February 2022. Dominic Lipinski/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA statement on behalf of the former prime minister sent to CNN on Monday described such scenes as “a barrel-load of nonsense peddled for no other reason than to provide maximum – and entirely false – dramatic impact.”\n\n“Sir John has not co-operated – in any way – with The Crown. Nor has he ever been approached by them to fact check any script material in this or any other series,” a spokesman for Major said in the statement.\n\n“Discussions between the Monarch and Prime Minister are entirely private and – for Sir John – will always remain so. But not one of the scenes you depict are accurate – in any way whatsoever. They are fiction, pure and simple,” the spokesman said.\n\n“There was never any discussion between Sir John and the then Prince of Wales about any possible abdication of the late Queen Elizabeth II – nor was such an improbable and improper subject ever raised by the then Prince of Wales (or Sir John),” he added.\n\n“Neither Sir John nor Dame Norma have discussed the Monarchy remotely in the terms you suggest in your email,” the spokesman said, adding: “What you report as depicted in the script has never been their view, never would be their view, and never will be their view.”\n\nThe latest season of “The Crown” is on track to air on Netflix on November 9, with Imelda Staunton set to take over the role of the Queen from Olivia Colman, who portrayed her in seasons 3 and 4.\n\nAccording to Netflix’s description, season 5 centers around the Queen “approaching the 40th anniversary of her accession.”\n\nNetflix responded to the furore on Monday, with a spokesperson saying in a statement: “The Crown has always been presented as a drama based on historical events.”\n\n“Series 5 is a fictional dramatisation, imagining what could have happened behind closed doors during a significant decade for the royal family – one that has already been scrutinised and well-documented by journalists, biographers and historians,” the spokesperson added.\n\nThe show, which was created by Peter Morgan, swept the drama categories at last year’s Emmy awards, winning the top prize of the night, the award for outstanding drama series.", "authors": ["Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "British royal family line of succession: Who's who | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

An honest account of a reading by the 'Life ...", "text": "Tyler Henry is the 26-year-old \"Hollywood Medium.\"\n\nNow he has a new Netflix series, \"Life After Death.\"\n\nHe gives a \"reading\" to reporter Erin Jensen, who is surprised by some of the \"eerie\" details.\n\nCan Tyler Henry really connect with the dead? A reading from the supposed clairvoyant seemed to be the only way to find out.\n\nHenry, who first gained notoriety in 2016 as E!'s \"Hollywood Medium,\" \"reading\" celebrities, says he gets messages from the deceased through his five senses. \"I might get a very strong vision. I might get what feels like a song stuck in my head,\" Henry, 26, says.\n\nOur reading, arranged to promote his new Netflix series, \"Life After Death with Tyler Henry\" (now streaming), mirrors those of his non-celebrity clients. Though ours is conducted over video chat. The nine-episode series also attempts to solve his family's mystery: How his mom, Theresa, ended up in the custody of a woman evil enough to commit double-homicide – whom Theresa learned only a few years ago is not her biological mother.\n\n‘American Idol’:Formerly homeless singer blows Katy Perry away with judge’s own song\n\nHenry says he first became aware of his ability at age 10. He says he had a premonition that his grandmother \"was going to die\" and was proved right. His mom was notified shortly after of his grandmother's death. Henry's now amassed a waiting list of more than 300,000 people seeking readings, according to the series.\n\n\"Life After Death\" highlights what seems like an impressive ability, but could it be the result of skillful editing or thorough research of his subjects? Ahead of my reading, I'm assured that he has not been given my name in advance.\n\nI ask my mom and cousin to sit in on the chat so they can verify any of Henry's statements that I can't. I also secretly hope that my cousin will hear from his dad, who died of a heart attack more than eight years ago.\n\nHow low can 'AGT: Extreme' go? Fire limbo performer sizzles, critic Simon Cowell feels the burn\n\nEerily accurate: Circumstances of my cousin's death\n\nSure, there are things you can Google about me or find on Ancestry.com. So when Henry sees a red rose during our reading relating to my mother's side, I'm impressed – my middle name is Rose, after my maternal grandmother – but I'm also skeptical since my full name is in my Instagram and Twitter handles.\n\nBut Henry also knows of my diabetic aunt who lost a toe, which he says creates a sensation in his feet. \"I feel almost like my circulation doesn't go to my toes or something, and I usually attribute that to diabetes. But it's bad, somebody literally lost blood flow through the extremities.\"\n\nHe also brings up a recent educational decision for my oldest niece, who will be starting a new school in the fall, which he says is just my deceased family members' way of proving they're around. \"This was just talked about,\" Henry says (and he's right). \"It's just validation that they're here.\"\n\nHe pulls two family members' names out of the air. He says my mom is \"is going to have a sense of responsibility, wanting to make sure everything goes smoothly for somebody else.\" (My dad has multiple sclerosis, and my mom is his caregiver.)\n\nHenry knows more about my family than I do. \"If anybody in the family has gotten genetic testing, that's a good thing,\" he says. Unbeknownst to me, my mom has, after a relative died of cancer.\n\nHenry makes several statements that are true. About 30 minutes into our reading, he asks if there's anything specific I'm curious about. I think of two people I hope Henry can connect to: my cousin's dad, and another cousin who drowned in 2006. I've seen the peace Henry's readings can bring survivors on TV, and I desperately want that kind of healing for my family. I mention \"two sudden passings\" to Henry, but that's all I give him.\n\nHenry says my cousin's dad is concerned about how his death affected his children and emphasizes \"father-son relationships, and not wanting to leave a mess emotionally.\" This tracks, as my cousin is male (but an only child).\n\nHenry also notes \"a change of plans\" when it comes to how my cousin's dad \"would have been memorialized or remembered ... There's something funny there with that of like, 'Oh, we thought we were gonna do that, then we put it off.' But it's like, 'No we gotta do it. We gotta do it.'\"\n\nMy cousin feels confident he knows what Henry is referring to: There's no headstone on his father's grave yet.\n\n\"I hope part of the healing today is relaying that message that he's all good, even if maybe we are still not resolving things,\" Henry says. \"Because it's important that that comes through for this son.\"\n\n'Walking Dead' walks on with 'Isle of the Dead' spinoff starring Maggie and Negan in Manhattan\n\nHenry also receives information about someone who died at what he calls a \"pivotal age.\" \"This would have been a situation where everyone was having a good time, and then very quickly things came to an abrupt halt,\" Henry says. \"The weird thing about his passing was that where it happened was very inaccessible.\"\n\nMy cousin drowned during an event dubbed River Raft Race when hordes of college students descend upon a river in central Texas. He was 21.\n\n\"I feel like part of our reading today really is meant to deliver messages to his (immediate) family,\" Henry says. \"There's just a feeling of needing it to be known that he's OK and that he needed to show up today.\"\n\nSunflowers with no roots\n\nHenry saw a significance of sunflowers that I couldn't make sense of. He also spoke about a trip – or a conversation about taking one – to my great-grandmother's birthplace, which I am not aware of. (She is from Monterrey.)\n\nRelating to my mom's side, Henry sees three sisters, but my grandmother is one of five girls.\n\nHenry also anticipates \"a pretty big career change over the course of the next year, even maybe in the next six months\" for my brother, which seems unlikely since he's very successful, focusing on real estate.\n\nSome of Henry's other statements seem true-ish, if you leave room for interpretation: An inscribed animal statue he mentions could refer to a box that features a boy hugging a dog. Henry sees two children for my cousin's dad and refers to an unfinished love story, which seems to fit. But statements of Henry's that have no truth to them seem far and few between.\n\nHenry admits he gets it wrong sometimes. But \"I don't think that invalidates when I get it right,\" he says. \"Even the best basketball players still miss their free throws sometimes, and we can still recognize that they have talent.\"\n\nWhy that 'Winning Time' pickup game with Magic Johnson, Norm Nixon had real 'fury and anger'\n\nFinal thoughts: For real or a fraud?\n\nAfter my reading, I'm convinced of Henry's ability. Like him, I believe we all have intuition. \"It's really a matter of trusting (your instincts) and refining them,\" he says.\n\nHow many times have you known a relationship was unraveling or had a gut instinct that turned out to be right? If you believe in an afterlife (and I do) why couldn't spirits have figured out a way to communicate?\n\nMy cousin whose father died, and the sister of my cousin who drowned, are convinced that Henry is the real deal.\n\nThe thing I'll treasure most from the experience is the peace they got from themessages relayed to them.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/entertainment/david-warner-actor-death-omen-titanic-cec/index.html", "title": "David Warner, who played villains in 'Titanic' and 'Tron,' dies at 80 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDavid Warner, an English actor who played villainous supporting characters with aplomb in films like “Titanic” and “Tron,” died over the weekend. He was 80.\n\nWarner died from a “cancer-related illness,” his family said in a statement shared by his talent agency with CNN. He’d been sick for 18 months, his family wrote, and “approached his diagnosis with a characteristic grace and dignity.”\n\nHis was a prolific career that spanned more than 50 years, from horror classics to Oscar winners; from beloved animated series to a Disney musical. There was hardly a genre of film he didn’t leave a mark on, he acknowledged in a 2017 interview with the AV Club.\n\n“I’ve done war pictures, I’ve done Westerns, I’ve done sci-fi … I mean, I wasn’t in ‘Harry Potter,’ and I wasn’t in ‘Lord Of The Rings,’ and I haven’t been in ‘Game Of Thrones,’” he told the AV Club. “So there are those big ones that I haven’t managed to do. But that’s show biz … and, you know, I think I’ve still done okay.”\n\nA career spanning Shakespeare, horror and a best picture winner\n\nWarner began his career onstage after studying at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He starred in several productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing as the title roles in “Richard II” and “Hamlet.” He also appeared in the 1968 film adaptation of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” alongside Helen Mirren, Judi Dench and Diana Rigg.\n\nThough he often played Shakespearean heroes onstage, in films, he was often cast as the antagonist. In Disney’s landmark sci-fi flick “Tron,” he played a power-hungry executive who passed off Jeff Bridges’ ideas as his own. In “Titanic,” he conspired with Billy Zane’s antagonist to keep the central lovebirds apart as the deliciously named Spicer Lovejoy. And in Terry Gilliam’s “Time Bandits,” Warner quite literally played the role of “Evil.”\n\nDavid Warner (right) played Spicer Lovejoy in \"Titanic,\" a snide companion to Billy Zane's Caldeon Hockley. 20th Century Fox/Paramount/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nSome of Warner’s most enduring roles saw him play the second banana: In “The Omen,” he wasn’t the villain but the victim, portraying a photographer threatened by the demonic child Damien. He also appeared in three of director Sam Peckinpah’s films, including the World War II ensemble film “Cross of Iron.”\n\nWhen he could, Warner played against type, appearing as Ebenezer Scrooge’s sympathetic employee Bob Cratchit in a TV movie of “A Christmas Carol.” He acted in two “Star Trek” films, including one appearance as a Klingon. In his last film role, he played eccentric military veteran Admiral Boom, who regularly fires cannons to mark the time, in “Mary Poppins Returns.”\n\nHe also lent his voice to animated productions, like “Batman: The Animated Series” (as Ra’s al Ghul) and “The Amazing World of Gumball.” He said in 2017 appearing in “kids pictures,” like “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II,” was “great fun.” He also mentioned his “utmost respect for the actors in the turtle suits.”\n\nIn \"Tron,\" Warner played a tech exec who stole protagonist Jeff Bridges' work. Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nDespite his prolific career, Warner often regarded his legacy with a lightheartedness. In the 2017 AV Club interview, Warner said that as a young person, he was “hopeless” both academically and athletically, and so he “drifted into the odd school play.”\n\n“I’m the kind of actor where you go around, you do your best, and you see what happens,” he told the AV Club.\n\nDavid Warner remembered\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, who starred with Warner in “Mary Poppins Returns,” shared a photo of himself with the late actor.\n\n“So glad to have been able to express my admiration for David Warner’s incredible versatility and career in our time together on set,” Miranda wrote on Twitter. “My goodness, what a life and legacy.”\n\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company remembered Warner as he was in 1965, when he played Hamlet as a “tortured student in his long orange scarf.”\n\n“David seemed the epitome of 1960s youth, and caught the radical spirit of a turbulent age,” said the company’s artistic director emeritus Gregory Doran. “He was a generous spirit, a kind man, and a huge talent.”\n\nWarner is survived by his partner Lisa Bowerman, son Luke and his “many gold dust friends,” among others, his family wrote in their statement.\n\n“He will be missed hugely by us, his family and friends, and remembered as a kind-hearted, generous and compassionate man, partner and father whose legacy of extraordinary work has touched the lives of so many over the years,” his family said.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2015/08/26/kid-rock-early-years-detroit/31193049/", "title": "Kid Rock before the fame: The definitive Detroit oral history", "text": "Brian McCollum\n\nDetroit Free Press Pop Music Critic\n\n\"It felt like being part of this secret in Detroit that soon the whole world was going to know about.\" — Tommy Valentino\n\nWhen Kid Rock kicks off a sold-out, 10-show stand Friday at DTE Energy Music Theatre, he'll roll out a set of familiar hits and stage moves — the material he's made famous since his national breakout in 1998.\n\nBut as most Detroit fans know, there's far more to the Kid Rock saga than that.\n\nBy the time his 10-show run wraps up, he'll have played to 150,000 hometown fans. Why is Kid Rock so big in Detroit?\n\nBecause Kid Rock got a head start in Detroit: a decade of building his name, grooming his sound and reinventing his persona from scrappy hip-hop street kid to swaggering rock-rap showman.\n\nThis year brought a new career chapter: Rock's album, \"First Kiss,\" marked his departure from Atlantic Records, the company that launched him into the national spotlight with 1998's 10-million-selling \"Devil Without a Cause.\"\n\nGetting to that point wasn't without struggle. The teenage Kid Rock had been dropped by his first label, and he returned to Detroit in the early '90s disillusioned but determined to make it on his own terms — driven not by money but by an intense thirst for fame.\n\nHere's a look back at those early Detroit years, 1990 to '98, when a young Bob Ritchie hustled hard to get noticed — and molded himself into the Kid Rock the rest of the world knows today.\n\nRomeo-born Ritchie was a little-known 17-year-old rapper and DJ when he was signed by the New York hip-hop label Jive Records, which issued his 1990 debut album, \"Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast.\" He'd spent his teen years playing east side house parties and making connections on Detroit's fledgling hip-hop scene, and \"Grits\" was his Beastie Boys-inspired record of bawdy, boasting rap.\n\nJive booked Kid Rock on that year's Straight from the Underground package tour with Too Short and others — a shot at a national audience.\n\nBut his Jive stint was brief, and the young rapper was soon back in Detroit plotting his next move.\n\nIt would be the key stage in Kid Rock's evolution, as his hair grew longer, his music grew louder and his live show grew bigger.\n\nMIKE E. CLARK (producer-mixer): I cut his demos as a kid before he got signed in 1989. I was working with mostly young black teenagers then. I didn't know he was white — we caught each other off-guard when he came in. I thought, \"Yeah, sure. A white guy is going to rap.\" But he shut me up. He had his turntable, had his beats, his stuff already written. He had his shit together and blew me away.\n\nHe was very confident, had the high-top fade, very sharp. You could tell right away he wasn't bullshitting. He had a shitty little Casio keyboard, and knew exactly how he was going to do it.\n\nHe took those demos and got a deal with Jive.\n\nJOE NIEPORTE (manager, the Ritz, State Theatre): I ran the original Ritz in Roseville, an 1,800-seat venue. Very large. He wanted a gig. He came in pretty cocky: \"I'm going to fill this place.\" Every band I talk to says that. But he had a lot of wits about him. Just a strong, cool personality.\n\nWe did the gig and he put 1,200 people in there. I was blown away.\n\nHe had a great street team, a lot of little kids helping him back then.\n\nJERRY (VILE) PETERSON (publisher, Orbit magazine): He had this giant Mt. Clemens posse. The high school friends. You'd meet so many of them at once.\n\nNIEPORTE: Bob was just straight-up rap then. He didn't have a band. You've heard that early stuff — a lot of profanity, real edgy, hard-core. I wasn't a big rap fan, but I liked his stuff. But I remember telling him, \"Dude, if you're going to make it to the next level, you've got to clean it up.\"\n\nMIKE HIMES (owner, Record Time shop): When \"Grits Sandwiches\" came out, he came in for an in-store (performance) at 10 and Gratiot. He had the tall hair, spinning like he would at the bars in Mt. Clemens. We had a decent turnout. Toward the end, this blond-haired skinny kid kept yelling out — \"I'll battle you! I'll battle you!\" Just persistently getting in Kid Rock's face. I came up to him: \"Dude, this is his day, his event. Maybe one day you'll have your day, but leave the guy alone.\" He followed him out to the parking lot still wanting to battle.\n\nThat was Eminem. He gave him a couple of his tapes: \"Check me out.\" At least Kid Rock was cordial about it.\n\nCLARK: (In 1990) Vanilla Ice came out and stunk things up. So Jive decided they didn't want a white rapper anymore. They couldn't see the future, and they dropped Kid Rock, which was devastating to him. He got a deal with an independent label, Continuum, and said, \"(Screw) it, Clark. Let's do this record.\" We worked on \"Polyfuze Method\" at the (Ferndale studio) Tempermill in '92.\n\nWith Jive, he tried to be the rap guy, keeping it all hip-hop. But — and this is just my opinion — he got disillusioned by being dropped. So he was like, \"(Screw) it, I'm going to do my own thing.\"\n\nTOMMY VALENTINO (music attorney): His attitude now was, \"I'm not going to count on any record company to make me a star.\"\n\nPETERSON: The whole Vanilla Ice comparison, he dreaded so much. It was a source of shame in that whole thing. In his first interview (with Orbit in 1990), he was saying he's not a Vanilla Ice, that he was trying to be the real deal. And he always told me it was his parents' music that influenced him. Definitely Seger, which was like old-people music at that time.\n\n\"The Polyfuze Method,\" a heavy, frenetic record, was released in summer 1993.​\n\nCLARK: We were adding rock guitars, sampling Pink Floyd, any crazy stuff. At one point we had a flute player come in. We just didn't care.\n\nHe liked all kinds of music. When he goes to make music, he does what he thinks sounds good. If that was mixing a flute or heavy metal guitar on top of 808 drums — as long as it sounded good, that's what he did.\n\nNIEPORTE: \"Polyfuze Method\" had a great rap presence, but also brought a strong rock feel. When I heard it, I thought, wow, this guy is on to something. And he toned it down (lyrically). Not a lot. But he did tone it down.\n\nHIMES: It was his crossroads record: the hip-hop influence, but starting to lean toward rock.\n\nDAVID LEE (friend): The fact that he's now associated with so many genres of music isn't a surprise. Even though we looked at him as a hip-hop guy after the Jive thing, you could start to see those other elements — the rock 'n' roll, the country.\n\nBRIAN PASTORIA (drummer, rock band DC Drive): I remember Bob coming to a bunch of our shows at the Ritz in the early '90s. Our singer, Joey Bowen, liked the Beastie Boys, so when we did \"You Need Love,\" we'd have this big breakdown with Joey rapping.\n\nBob knew he couldn't keep going down that Vanilla Ice path. It got him attention at first, but he realized that's not where he wanted to be. He was tired of the rap thing with programmed tracks. He wanted to do the Beastie Boys thing — only in a bigger, more rock kind of way.\n\nKid Rock was fighting for a name on the scrappy Detroit hip-hop scene of the '90s, amid acts such as Insane Clown Posse, Esham and Eminem.\n\nIn summer 1993, Rock's ex-girlfriend gave birth to his son, Robert Ritchie Jr., who became known to everyone as Junior. Later that year, Rock found his way to White Room Studios in downtown Detroit, run by brothers Michael and Andrew Nehra — rock musicians then forming the rock-soul band Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise.\n\nRock cut tracks for his second and final Continuum release, the \"Fire It Up\" EP, which featured the rock-heavy \"I Am the Bullgod\" and a new country twist: a gritty cover of Hank Williams Jr.'s \"Country Boy Can Survive.\"\n\nRock soon launched his own label, Top Dog Records, and kept himself in local record racks with his \"Bootleg\" cassette series featuring new tracks and reworked material.\n\nBOB EBELING (drummer, engineer): We were living together (in Sterling Heights) at possibly his lowest point. He had lived with (girlfriend) Kelly. There were three kids, he thought two of them were his, and then he found out that one of them wasn't. He was really emotionally torn up, going through that deep heartbreak stuff.\n\nThey split up and that's when I moved in the apartment. He was also kind of disenfranchised from his dad at that point. There wasn't a lot of financial support coming from the family. So he was probably most alone at that point — being heartbroken and away from his family and being on a smaller label like Continuum, not getting as much financial support.\n\nBut the one thing that was still there: He was motivated by fame. I've worked with five or six pretty big stars — Eminem, Rufus Wainwright, Phish — and there's a certain archetype personality that just needs to be famous. Fame is quite an ugly thing to me, and most people would be scared to death of it, but he was driven by it. He talked about it in ways that didn't even make sense to me. He relished it.\n\nHe loved when we went somewhere to eat and somebody recognized him. He had this whole reward system in his head that didn't exist in other people's heads: When people recognize you and want a piece of you, it was the equivalent of being wealthy. He just ate it up.\n\nAL SUTTON (White Room co-founder, engineer): We were the grunge, hard-rock studio. Bands came in with amplifiers, guitars and drums. And in walks this guy with a sampler and MPC60.\n\nHe started hanging out in the studio. We needed somebody with his skills in our camp. He could program and loop, and we needed to be a little more current in that way. We had a B-room that he basically took over, coming in midday and staying 'til 5 in the morning.\n\nMICHAEL NEHRA (White Room owner): Andy (Nehra) and I were a conduit for his creativity by giving him a studio to use. We worked with him in coproduction, engineering, some writing stuff. Bob was really fun to work with back then. He was creative, and we were all really good friends. We gave him the keys to the studio after the Continuum thing, and he created a lot of cool stuff there. There was this energy between the two rooms, creating music.\n\nSUTTON: He was cleaning all the time. He's a real neat freak, had to have his place really tidy. He'd vacuum the B-room and then go to work.\n\nWe thought he was good energy to have around. If we needed something programmed, he'd be here; if he needed a guitar part or drums, we could set it up. It became this symbiotic relationship.\n\nJIMMIE BONES (keyboardist): He was this guy that was always around, his Dickies and stocking cap on. He started asking me to come in: \"Hey, I'm doing a track; can you throw on some piano?\"\n\nNEHRA: He was learning from my brother and I. We were there playing the guitar and bass on \"Bullgod.\" Bob wrote the song, but my brother and I made it sound like \"Bullgod.\" Bob could play some guitar, but my brother and I were rock 'n' rollers who played the groove thing with Robert Bradley, and that energy certainly rubbed off. When he first came into the studio he didn't really sound like that.\n\nHe was starting to get more of a rock edge, and that's what we tapped into — that rock 'n' roll spirit, that Detroit soul thing.\n\nCLARK: The first time I ever heard him sing, East Detroit had recently changed its name to Eastpointe. So Bob changed the lyrics to Billy Joel's \"It's Still Rock and Roll to Me\" to record a cover version called \"It's Still East Detroit to Me.\" He started singing, and I was like, \"Dude, you sound amazing!\" He was just (messing) around, but he sounded really good. I could hear the tone. He could hit the notes.\n\nWhen \"Only God Knows Why\" became a big hit later on (in 1999), he looked at me and said, \"You know, you were the first (person) who told me I could sing.\"\n\nPETERSON: We'd have these Orbit karaoke nights, and that's when I learned he could actually sing. He'd do \"Stayin' Alive,\" all the parts. Plus he brought the mushrooms, which made the karaoke even more fun.\n\nHIMES: He was hustling, coming in on a regular basis to drop off his (tapes and records) on consignment. He had flyers for his shows, tickets for the DJ things he was doing. He already had a vision. He was promoting himself, trying to meet the right people. We'd sit in the store and he'd ask me questions at length — where to get records pressed, that kind of thing. He would pick your brain, just thirsty for information.\n\nSUTTON: He was killing it on the little tapes he was releasing, selling a ton of his own cassettes out of the record stores and his car. And he was making good money playing gigs.\n\nBut Bob wasn't getting a lot of credit from the hipsters and rock scene in Detroit. It was, \"Oh, he's a white rapper; no need to take him seriously.\"\n\nMARK BASS (producer, Eminem): He was innovative, always a few steps ahead of what hip-hop was doing. But hip-hop didn't want to hear it, because he was this white guy with the long rock hair.\n\nSCOTT LEGATO (photographer): I was a DJ, spinning rap at the Struttin' Club on Gratiot. He showed up with his records. I blew him off. Showed up again; blew him off. Third time, I owed him. So I put it on. The owner immediately ran in yelling, \"Take that shit off!\" I stopped the record. Kid Rock walked up and said, \"You're an asshole. Give me my records back.\"\n\nCLARK: I think ICP fueled Bob a lot. He wasn't a big fan, and when he saw these guys selling out the State Theatre, it threw gas on his flame. They really didn't get along. I was the guy in the middle: friends with Bob and working with ICP.\n\nHe was tenacious: \"OK, that thing didn't work; let's try this or that.\" And he kept gaining fans around town. He had the talent. He just needed to figure out how he could make other people realize he was a force to be reckoned with.\n\nNIEPORTE: He'd go to every high school around here and pop his trunk open when school let out, handing out free samplers. Back then, all-ages shows didn't really exist. It was 18 and over, headliners going on at midnight. So Bob comes in, promotes his shows as all-ages with early starts, and he's getting 1,200 kids in there.\n\nHe drew from all over (metro Detroit), but predominantly the east side. He was from Romeo, and he had cut his chops in Mt. Clemens, so those were his roots.\n\nUNCLE KRACKER (friend, DJ): He built a following. He'd play the Majestic or the Ritz, then bounce around back to (smaller venues like) Alvin's or St. Andrew's. He would play once every six months or so — make it look like he was coming through on tour as opposed to beating everybody in Michigan over the head every weekend. He was very smart about that whole supply-and-demand thing.\n\nYou'd have 900 people in the room — all these little white kids who dropped acid and liked listening to gangsta rap.\n\nMARC KEMPF: (hip-hop manager, promoter): There were (hip-hop) scenes developing at the Hip Hop Shop and St. Andrew's Hall, the \"Two Floors of Fun.\" But he was a maverick. He was doing his thing. He wasn't part of another scene, coming up with other artists.\n\nBASS: With Bobby's thing, he didn't have to fit in the same way Marshall (Eminem) did. Marshall was on that underground hip-hop, kind of edgy, street level. Bobby was also on the street level — just a different street with nicer lights. (Laughs) When you saw Kid Rock onstage, it was such a show that it was more of an alternative-rock thing.\n\nIn 1994, a festive Sunday music scene was emerging at the Bear's Den in Berkley, led by the funky, eclectic Howling Diablos. Rock became a weekly regular, and many have cited the Diablos' rapping, fedora-topped front man Tino Gross as a big influence on Rock's onstage style.\n\nHis shows to that point had been a standard rap setup — Rock rapping, Uncle Kracker or DJ Blackman on turntables — but now he was assembling a revolving group of stage musicians to join him. He adopted a band name that endures today: Twisted Brown Trucker.\n\nTINO GROSS (Howling Diablos): Bob's sister Carol was a cocktail waitress, and she told him about us. He told me later, \"I figured if she liked you, it had to be wack, because she's my older sister. Man, was I wrong.\"\n\nThere was some magical energy going on in the Bear's Den. It was this real organic underground thing, all about the music. A lot of things came together there, and Bob was a big part of it. He'd come in right behind us with his turntables and record crate. He'd scratch with us, and after a while, I was giving him the mic. He'd be our toaster, rap some stuff, sing the choruses together. The Diablos' mentality was like jazz musicians — anything can fit in.\n\nHe had been doing these all-ages shows around town, where parents dropped off their kids in the middle of the afternoon. Now he was trying to grow his brand and reach older people more into rock and blues, beyond the limited young hip-hop crowd around Detroit.\n\nBRAD SHAW (Kid Rock photographer): The Howling Diablos were good, and he got a lot of ideas from them. Tino is such a great showman, and the whole band are such great players. Bob was down there every Sunday night.\n\nI'm sure he got a lot of this and that from them, there's no doubt. He put that in the back of his head. He was always about the funk and rock 'n' roll anyway. He knew his hometown stuff. He was aware of everything, from Seger to Alice Cooper.\n\nBONES: The Bear's Den thing was a real melting pot vibe. It would start with the Diablos, then just a big jam after that, where all these players are coming up. That played a big role in making Bob known. He could get up there and freestyle and put that into a jam situation. It helped him cross over to maybe some folks that wouldn't have taken that (rap) genre very seriously, or weren't all that knowledgeable about it.\n\nCLARK: Bob was fascinated by all that. The fact that they could put on a live show and captivate an audience — that was inspirational.\n\nGROSS: A lot of people will tell you he got a lot from the Howling Diablos, that's true. For me to say it, it sounds weird. But we were older, and he was a young guy soaking it in. Ideas were flowing on that scene. Our thing was probably the closest to what he ultimately ended up doing.\n\nThere were many times Bob said, \"You guys are going to be the next big wave out of here.\" He was very much a supporter. So it wasn't like, \"I'm taking their thing and running away with it.\" It was an overlapping, organic thing.\n\nKRACKER: I started DJing for him (in 1990) when I was still in high school. My first gig DJing for him, I had just gotten my license.\n\nHe figured out he could start playing bars in other cities if he had an actual backup band too. Nobody was going to book him with just the track thing behind him. So he started putting together a group.\n\nGROSS: I think he saw with us how it works to rap over a live band. He could see it and feel it. Sometime around the Bear's Den period, he decided to put his own thing together, similar to what we were doing, and he created a band.\n\nEBELING: The first big concert with the band was at St. Andrew's, sometime in the late fall of '93. That was the first incarnation of Twisted Brown Trucker, though it wasn't called that just yet.\n\nBONES: That idea also came from Public Enemy, (rap acts) like that who were using live stuff. Chuck D had started running live bands. The Beasties too. Those guys had a huge influence on him.\n\nEBELING: He was very interactive in his show, constantly changing up the sequence. We were just blasting through all the material. He was very involved in how to manipulate the energy of the crowd — lay back for a while then bring it up. He had the whole thing orchestrated, orchestrating the band and the background sequence.\n\nNEHRA: He was experimenting with different musicians. There was this circle of people around Detroit. It wasn't the Jack White circle. It was this unsung, not-quite-so-hip movement that was going on.\n\nEBELING: In 1994, we booked a couple of weeks on the road, odd dates in Sarnia, around Iowa and Ohio, some of the colleges. We went out and did these half-assed gigs in front of 20 people, sometimes five. If it was closer to home like Toledo, it would be pretty packed, a couple hundred kids. And every time we were back around Detroit, it would be a full house.\n\nYou were definitely feeling the struggle of it all, unless we were home playing the Palladium or Ritz — 2,000 kids, $2,000 in merchandise, $40,000 at the door.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to track all the early variations of Twisted Brown Trucker. There was massive turnover. That's because (band members) were saying, \"OK, I'm not really getting paid from this, and he is.\"\n\nVICKIE SILER (Toledo fan): I was in my early 20s. I was mostly a rap fan, but I still loved hanging out with the drunk uncles listening to classic rock. When I saw Kid Rock, I was like, \"Well, that's it!\" The first time was in '93 at the Main Event in Toledo. It was $5 or $7. My friends were more excited about ICP playing in town that same night.\n\nI could tell he had a voice like Rage Against the Machine — that harsh rocker voice — along with his rapping skills. Just this crazy dude. He had that cocky walk to him, the real pimp thing.\n\nI worked as a stripper. I used to tell my girlfriends, \"Let's go see that rapper dude Kid Rock.\" He'd have the turntables going, some background beats, holding a microphone. Stripper music, I called it. That boom-boom bass, where you could feel it. It was dirty, dingy, nasty, just some kind of fun stuff. We'd go to the show and dance, then go back to work.\n\nGROSS: I did an interview with Dr. John on my blues radio show, and he went on and on about the midgets who were a big part of the New Orleans rhythm-and-blues scene, the whole carnival thing down there. I gave Bob a tape of that show to listen to on a road trip.\n\nJoe C had already been showing up at Bob's shows as a fan. Being the guy he is, Bob doesn't miss a trick. After that, he looked out at Joe C one night and a light bulb went off.\n\nJoseph (Joe C) Calleja was a 21-year-old Taylor resident who stood 3 feet, 9 inches, his growth stunted by the coeliac disease that later took his life. Joe C became an onstage staple of Rock's concerts, a dynamic, popular, dirty-mouthed presence. He was part of a live set that would eventually get honed with a light show, pyro, dancers and a light-up \"KID ROCK\" backdrop.\n\nNIEPORTE: I left the Ritz in '94 to run the State Theatre (in Detroit). I wanted to book Bob there, and there was some worry that it was too big. I really put my ass on the line. It was the first State show he did with Joe C and Uncle Kracker, and we ended up with well over 2,000 people.\n\nGROSS: It was such a showbiz thing. Joe C made the band more exciting. Bob was trying something new onstage, different people coming and going. But Joe C just stuck. Onstage, it was a beautiful thing.\n\nAt the Detroit Music Awards (in 1997), we played with Bob. Ted Nugent was on the radio the next day ranting: \"This Kid Rock character had a 6-year-old boy up there. It's just not right!\" Kid Rock just smiled and gave me a thumbs-up.\n\nLEE: There was a family atmosphere around Bob. When Junior became the same size as Joe C, he could never understand why Joe C got to do stuff like run into the street, drink beer, leave with the adults. It was always hysterical.\n\nIn 1996, still working at White Room, Kid Rock released his most rock-oriented record yet, \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp,\" joined by a host of Detroit musicians that included Gross and the Nehras.\n\n\"I always wanted guitars and live stuff. And that comes with money and connections,\" Rock told the Free Press at the time. \"So I've tried to surround myself with talented people that I get along with.\"\n\nEBELING: Bob just has this unreal constitution that can keep partying. That's the last fill-in-the-blank of \"how to be a rock star.\" He can party for three days straight. You'll wake up that fourth day and feel like dying. He snaps out of bed ready for the party to keep going. And it's not that he's cheating — he's as drunk and stoned as anybody else. He's got something in his genes.\n\nOne morning, we both woke up at the apartment after a couple hours of sleep. He was revved up and ready to continue that level of insanity. And it just came out of my mouth: \"Dude, you are the early-morning, stoned pimp.\"\n\nTHORNETTA DAVIS (R&B singer): He was hanging out at the White Room a lot then. I sang on a couple of things on \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp.\" He was showing us what to sing, and I said, \"Wow, you've got a voice — you're not just a rapper!\" And lo and behold, he's a singer now.\n\nHe wanted me to do a lyric that was pretty risqué. I'm like, \"I have a little girl; can you not publicize that I'm on the album?\" Sure enough, it comes out, and I'm on the credits. (Laughs)\n\nEBELING: He was gaining momentum with \"Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp,\" had his whole Detroit posse going, and stabilizing the band with the final lineup — Kenny Olson and Jason Krause on guitar. He had Joe C up there, starting to get the final elements of how it was going to look. It was becoming the well-groomed show he would (later) tour with.\n\nSHAW: He played the Club in Toledo around that time, and began the routine of changing into his pimp getup. He'd run offstage back toward us, tearing his clothes off. There wasn't much time. You've got a guy throwing on a '70s pimp outfit — it was hysterical and hard not to laugh.\n\nHe'd go back out in the pimp outfit with a gun down his pants. And it was a real gun. (Laughs) You'd have to ask him if it was loaded. It probably was.\n\nPETERSON: He was just a lot of fun to be with. If you went to the strip bar with Bob, you'd have dancers sitting all over. In those days, it was hanging out at Garfield's or strip bars. When you went out with Bob after he started getting some money, it was great. Always crazy fun.\n\nLEE: It's well known that a lot of partying was going on. We were all rolling around Detroit for a few years. Nights would turn into days pretty fast. The bars, the hundreds of beers, the chicks. He was just a cool, fun guy to be around.\n\nBut that shouldn't overshadow the fact that Bob was deadly serious about two things: raising Junior, and his career.\n\nBASS: The partying just added to the whole thing. Same thing that made Mick Jagger. He was never out of control. He was always a great businessman, a marketing genius.\n\nSHAW: It was never about laying around getting stoned, thinking he's a rock star. He was constantly asking, \"What can I do to top that?\" He was always going a step ahead of the last show.\n\nHe'd call at 3 in the morning: \"Dude, I'll meet you at the White Room in an hour. I've got a stripper to help with a photo shoot.\"\n\nLEE: Bob and his boys dressed a little different — the windbreakers, baggy pants, high-tops. We would take them to hang out in certain rock 'n' roll establishments, and not only did they stand out, we were sometimes told they weren't welcome.\n\nGROSS: Memphis Smoke (in Royal Oak) was really pushing the Diablos to do a show. We knew we were too wild to be in there. But we start playing, Bob shows up and gets up there rapping. Fun night. I go back in the manager's office, and he reads the riot act. \"What was that blond asshole doing onstage with you guys? Don't ever bring that shit around here again. You guys don't need that!\"\n\nThat sound had not been on the radio yet. And they saw rap as some garbage music that was for stupid kids. We knew it could work. To me, it was like punk rock — we were building our own scene, and not everybody was down with it.\n\nSUTTON: One of the records coming out then was Alanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\" A lot of rock guys didn't like that album — it was programmed, had the drum machines. We were hanging out with a guy saying it sucked. Bob said, \"You don't know what you're talking about. That record is going to be huge.\" Bob was totally on it. He saw the writing on the wall, where music was going, and he totally grabbed that.\n\nJOEL MARTIN (owner, 54 Sound): This kid was doing something with the Internet that others weren't hip to yet. His small house in Royal Oak was like a crash pad and record company. When I saw the operation in his basement, it blew my mind. The mailing lists, the street teams. He had a crew of people working the computer, doing things that at the time were really foreign. He understood at the very beginning what the whole Internet thing was about.\n\nSUTTON: I was impressed. A young dude in music, already buying a house. Not too bad. He had interns that would come in from different states. It was hilarious — some kid flying in from California to make flyers for a couple of months. Bob always worked like he was a superstar.\n\nAlongside manager Steve Hutton, the New York music attorney Tommy Valentino was now aboard the Kid Rock team, and the pair helped foster buzz outside Detroit, including key stories in the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal magazine and the trade publication Hits. In 1997, they finally snagged the attention of a big record-biz exec: Jason Flom, head of Lava Records, part of the powerhouse label Atlantic Records.\n\nSUTTON: We were at a restaurant in Royal Oak, a bunch of us hanging out, and he said, \"Man, my next record … I've come up with this thing. I'm going to do a redneck, shit-kicking rock 'n' roll rap band.\" Everybody was laughing — \"So that's it, eh?\"\n\nVALENTINO: I flew in to see him at the State Theatre (in 1996). I was blown away by his performance, how packed the place was, and the diversity of the people there — everything from bikers to strippers to in between. Younger, older, from different backgrounds, all of them into it. At one point a woman threw a bra onstage, and I'm thinking, \"This is an old-time rock 'n' roll show!\"\n\nSteve Hutton and I were shopping Kid Rock together (to record labels). No one was interested: \"White rap isn't what's in right now.\" They weren't getting it. It was frustrating. I kept saying, \"He's not a white rapper. He's a rock star and everything in between.\"\n\nI really felt that if someone just saw the live show, they were going to sign him.\n\nJASON FLOM (Lava/Atlantic Records, 2003 Free Press interview): Andrew Karp, an A&R guy for Lava, went to see him in Cleveland at a place called the Grog Shop. He told me, \"Hey, there were only 40 people there, but the guy put on a stadium show. He came out of a coffin at the beginning, he's got this vertically challenged guy, and it's a spectacle. You've got to see it.\"\n\nVALENTINO: From a visual perspective, he was just starting to develop the persona that exploded, jumping up and down, hair going back and forth, no shirt. Like Anthony Kiedis of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, only dressed in hip-hop attire. He never stopped moving onstage the whole time. It was stunning to see visually.\n\nThe live show was a combination of hip-hop, rock, even some country. There was almost a Lynyrd Skynyrd thing going on. In trying to sell this (to record labels), it became clear to me that the rock angle was what really needed to be stressed.\n\nFLOM: We went to Detroit shortly thereafter to see him at the State Theatre. And it was every bit the spectacle that we'd talked about.\n\nDetroit Free Press, May 25, 1997: \"When Detroit hip-hop-roots-rocker Kid Rock hits the State Theatre stage Friday night, there will be some important sets of ears in the audience. It's a showcase gig, and the major label reps are heading into the house to check out the colorful, pounding show from Rock and his crew.\"\n\nBONES: It was a big thing. There was a little more rehearsing that went on for that one. You could feel there was a lot at stake. But it was still a lot of fun — not like a lot of tension or anything. Something just felt like the shit was about to hit.\n\nMARTIN: I was knocked out of my seat at the State Theatre. It was like watching an explosion. Joe C was up there. The whole presentation was so carnival-like. He's got the savvy of a P.T. Barnum. He mixed those styles, and it just worked. It seemed symbolic of changing times.\n\nNIEPORTE: Flom pulled me aside and spent half an hour drilling me with questions: How well do you know him, does he do drugs, is his head on straight? Bob put on a phenomenal show that day. He got signed because of that gig.\n\nFLOM: After (the show), we arranged to meet in the basement of some disco club, some crazy place in Detroit. Rock got there about 2:30 in the morning. We sat there under the fluorescent lights, a very surreal setting, to discuss what kind of record would he make. After that meeting, he went and laid down a couple of tracks — \"Somebody's Gotta Feel This\" and \"I Got One for Ya\" — and sent them to us a few weeks later.\n\nI was in a car in L.A. on Hollywood Boulevard when I put in the two tracks. I called him immediately and said, \"I'll give you whatever you want.\" We made a deal on the phone.\n\nHis major-label contract in hand, Rock worked on \"Devil Without a Cause\" through spring 1998, cutting tracks at the White Room and polishing the final versions at the Mix Room in Los Angeles. Most of the album was cowritten with Kracker.\n\nVALENTINO: Kracker brought a different melodic sensibility. Bob could give you all the other stuff, from the beats to the arrangements to the attitude. They developed into a great songwriting team.\n\nKRACKER: I would help writing verses and whatnot. But more than anything else, I was his biggest cheerleader and worst critic. If something fell out of his mouth and sucked, I'd tell him. That was me being selfish: For me, Bob was probably the closest thing to the kind of music I wanted to listen to. So if he spun something that was dumb, I'd tell him.\n\nBut he's great with melodies and lyrics. And he's great under pressure.\n\nLEE: You could feel it coming, the build-up before \"Devil.\" When guys like (Atlantic Records founder) Ahmet Ertegun and Jason Flom are coming into town, you can tell something special is going on.\n\nNEHRA: He took some tracks he'd previously recorded, remixed, overdubbed the vocals. \"Bullgod\" was an older one. Others he did from scratch — \"Cowboy\" was a brand new track.\n\nIt was an exciting time. We knew where Bob was heading.\n\nBASS: We were with Marshall (Eminem) at the Mix Room in L.A. (finishing \"The Slim Shady LP\") at the same time Bobby was there. Marshall wanted these deep vooka-vooka scratches on \"My Fault,\" so Bobby goes in and does those cuts, while Marshall goes in the other room and writes part of a song for him.\n\nIt was cool because we were both doing these records at the same time, and it was starting to feel like Detroit had it all sewed up.\n\n\"Devil Without a Cause\" was released in August 1998 and, after a slow initial build, exploded onto the national radar thanks to MTV appearances, the radio hits \"Bawitdaba\" and \"Cowboy,\" and a milestone set at Woodstock '99 televised to a national audience.\n\nFLOM: The first appearance he did on \"Fashionably Loud\" on MTV (in December 1998), he performed \"Bawitdaba.\" That was one where everybody went, uh oh. The tipping point occurred at the MTV Awards (in September 1999) when he did the medley with Run-D.M.C. and Aerosmith. Watching that, I said, \"Holy shit.\" What else could you say?\n\nVALENTINO: When he took the stage at Woodstock, I was so nervous. I said to myself, this is going to be a really, really big moment. … But every minute going by he was killing it more and more. It was like an athlete in the zone. It was that powerful. He'd been playing out. But really, what he displayed in that show was the savvy of a performer who had done 10 or 12 world tours.\n\nBASS: I'm not sure I'll be hearing (Eminem's) \"My Name Is\" on a classic rap station in 20 years. But you'll be hearing Bobby on classic rock and country. He made it work. Who thought we'd have country music with 808 kick drums.\n\nLEE: He had come back from New York after Jive with his tail between his legs. Doors were getting slammed in his face. Even around a lot of the music scene in Detroit, he was an outcast. In retrospect, that might have been the best thing to happen to him. The progress he made on his own meant they had to pay attention.\n\nCLARK: That first time I saw him when he walked into the studio in 1989, nobody knew who the hell he was, and he was carrying himself with so much confidence.\n\nWhen he was making \"Devil Without a Cause,\" he played me those first demos, and I listened to him rapping, \"I'm going platinum, I'm going platinum.\" I said, \"Come on, man. You haven't sold shit.\"\n\nBut he knew. He shut me up. He shut everybody up.\n\nContact Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com\n\nThese are the people whose voices you've read in this oral history, and their roles in the 1990s during Kid Rock's early Detroit days.\n\nMark Bass: His band Black Planet opened shows for Kid Rock in the early '90s, and Bass went on to a career producing Eminem records as part of the Bass Brothers.\n\nJimmie Bones: A veteran keyboardist on the Detroit scene who has been part of Twisted Brown Trucker for nearly two decades.\n\nMike E.

Fans will have to make do with Anthony Bridgerton, Daphne’s hotheaded eldest brother played by Jonathan Bailey, as their new leading man.\n\nHolly Thomas Holly Thomas\n\nIn this sophomore season, Anthony takes center stage, as of course does his love life. This focuses quickly on two sisters, Edwina Sharma (Charithra Chandran), who is the season’s belle and therefore the ideal choice, and the older, marriage-averse Kate (Simone Ashley), to whom the Viscount Bridgerton is naturally, immediately attracted. Having spent season 1 either in bed with his now-ex girlfriend or channeling his frustrations at their forced estrangement by dueling his best friend, Anthony has sworn off romance in favor of a resigned, clinical approach to marriage. With the prospects of his younger siblings to consider, he has vowed to find a mate appropriate to care for them and the future Bridgerton line – a choice that must be weighed independently of love. It’s a fluffy, addictive, entirely watchable disaster waiting to happen.\n\nAnthony was the bad boy in season 1, in many ways the shagging, chaotic, antithesis of the stoic, simmering Duke. Every time I watched the show, at least one viewing companion would huff when Anthony came on screen, dismissing “that prick” before heaving a gratified sigh upon the Duke’s next appearance. It was an understandable response. What indeed would be the point of a show whose entire m.o. is sensory overload, if we didn’t embrace Page’s concupiscent allure?\n\nJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton in episode 205 of 'Bridgerton.' Liam Daniel/NETFLIX\n\nIn the extenuatory spirit of “Bridgerton,” however, I think it’s worth giving Anthony a little more credit – or, at the very least, enough to justify our inevitable transference of affections this spring. It’s a low bar, but Anthony isn’t actually more problematic than the hero of season 1 – and doesn’t benefit from the years of Regency romance novel programming that, I’d argue, largely explain the audience’s more immediate sympathy for the Duke.\n\nWhile the Duke is a distracting, enticing fantasy, Anthony is essentially making it up as he goes along, masking his passions and fears behind bravado and stomping. Unlike the most famous Regency heroes, the “Pride and Prejudice” and “Emma” crowd who tend to be passively courted by mothers and daughters determined to snag advantageous matches, or harbor depths utterly at odds with the face they show the world, Anthony wears his goal plainly, crassly on his sleeve, and has set about fulfilling it himself.\n\nThe Duke’s habitual silence and harboring of secret demons very much fits the Mr. Darcy-style template every Jane Austen fan is hardwired to eat up. We’re primed to anticipate his redemption and ultimate union with Daphne, so we view his behavior leading up to that point charitably. He lies about the reason he won’t have kids? Of course he does, his dad was mean to him! Gaslights the woman who loves him when she calls him on that lie? He’ll make it up to her! Characterizes the barest hints about masturbation as a full debrief on sex and reproduction? He did his best! And he looked incredible!\n\nJonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton and Regé-Jean Page as Simon Basset, the Duke of Hastings, in Season 1 of 'Bridgerton.' Liam Daniel/Netflix\n\nPoor old Anthony is messier. While the Duke’s “rakish” past is primly referred to in gentlemen’s clubs and during “promenades” in the park, our first introduction to Anthony sees him making vigorous love to a woman against a tree. We don’t learn until later that she’s his girlfriend Siena, who he secretly supports financially. Anthony’s lust is framed from the get-go as an evasion of responsibility, while the Duke’s is just part of his red-blooded charm.\n\nThough both men initially eschew marriage, Anthony’s relationship to the institution is more authentically tortured than the Duke’s in season 1 – his own mother’s great love with his now-dead father looms over the action like an ideal he fears he can never live up to. As the show proceeds, Anthony’s lack of any recognizable endgame exposes his flaws in a far harsher light than the Duke. But though he also acts clumsily on selfish impulses, Anthony is much more honest about his feelings and motivations.\n\nWhen the Duke appears to have taken up with Daphne, Anthony tells him that though they’re good friends, family has to come first – and he’s just not keen on his little sis dating someone he knows to be a total, ahem, “rake” during her all-important first season. After he challenges the Duke to a duel, he goes right to Siena to give her the heads-up on his potential change of circumstances, and when it turns out he can’t run away with her after all, he offers to support her anyway.\n\nSimone Ashley as Kate Sharma, Jonathan Bailey as Anthony Bridgerton and Charithra Chandran as Edwina Sharma in episode 203 of 'Bridgerton.' LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX\n\nThough he’s constantly messing up, Anthony learns from (some) past mistakes – especially when it comes to letting Daphne choose her own mate and lecturing his younger brothers about their own romantic choices. He then gets a pretty rough deal when his mom orders him to give up Siena, even though she tells Daphne emphatically that she only cares about her marrying for love, but he shoulders it alone. His upfront, emotional approach in the first season having ended in heartbreak, and the fate of his family still weighing heavy on him as its head, it’s no wonder Anthony is resigned to manage his life along more practical lines thereafter.\n\nIt’s important at this juncture to stress just how rooted in fantasy “Bridgerton” is. It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country – one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th – has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. Lady Danbury, played by Adjoa Andoh, refers to the fact her family is accepted by society thanks to this unprecedented union – which doesn’t really tally with its presumably long-established noble lineage, but sounds encouraging.\n\nAll this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love in this show. As far as its audience is concerned, Anthony should be no exception, not least because of how familiar he is. As a man – an early 19th century one at that – who is not allowed by society to show vulnerability, it’s no wonder that his many insecurities manifest as arrogance.\n\nPrivileged, immature, impulsive, brain-in-their-pants Anthonys are everywhere. He’s a damn sight more real than a romantic hero like the Duke, whose deceit is “really understandable, when you think about it,” and who improves if you just give him enough space. In real life, men who habitually lie by omission tend not to change. Half-grown guys like Anthony on the other hand, might – especially once they learn to communicate their emotions in a less explosive way. This would definitely take longer than a summer season in reality, but in magnolia-scented fictional Mayfair, anything is possible.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

Patriarchy hurts men too, albeit so much less than women, and it’s inevitable that men who fall victim will turn other people into scratching posts for their confusion and frustrations. The glossy, candy-cane world of “Bridgerton” offers an infinitely safer forum for Anthony to work through his demons than real life might, but he’s still a randy, confused man-child with seven siblings to father. And, as they would in real life, the classism, sexism and puritanical values that hurt everyone are hurting him too.", "authors": ["Holly Thomas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/25"}]}

In 2015, HRA Pharma acquired norgestrel and rebranded it as Opill with the sole purpose of getting government approval to sell the pill over the counter.\n\nThe pill is currently sold without a prescription in the United Kingdom. Other contraceptive pills are available without prescription across much of the globe, including in South America, Asia and Africa.\n\nOpill cost: Will insurance cover it?\n\nHRA Pharma says Opill may be available to consumers in early 2024, but the company has yet to reveal how much it will cost.\n\nPrescription birth control pills on the market range from $10 to $50 without insurance, depending on the type of pill and brand, said Dr. Carolyn Westhoff, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nInsurance companies generally cover prescription birth control pills, but it’s unclear if they will cover over-the-counter products.\n\nThe Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, one of the country’s largest health insurance networks, is leaving that decision to their 34 locally operated BCBS companies, according to company spokesperson Kelly Parsons.\n\nIt’s also unclear whether Opill will be covered by Medicaid, the government insurance program used by many low-income and disabled people, experts say. While some states cover certain over-the-counter products like emergency contraception, others don’t.\n\nPatients who don’t have easy access to the health care system may benefit the most from over-the-counter birth control pills. But these same patients also tend to live in underserved communities and have lower income, so experts say affordability is key.\n\nSex education and sexually transmitted infections\n\nThe ability to get birth control pills without a prescription is not intended to replace regular doctor visits.\n\nBut some experts worry patients may be less inclined to get checkups if they no longer need refills for birth control, especially as data shows doctor appointment wait times have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nA 2022 survey by Merritt Hawkins, a physician search firm, found the average wait to see an OB/GYN increased from 23 days in 2004 to nearly 32 days in 2022. The longest wait time reported was a whopping 93 days in 2022.\n\nSkipping a doctor’s visit may not only be detrimental to a person’s health but it could also be a missed opportunity to provide sexual health education – particularly among younger patients, Sophocles said.\n\nIt could contribute to already rising cases of sexually transmitted infections, as providers typically take the opportunity to test for such infections when they learn a patient is sexually active. Birth control pills do not protect against sexually transmitted infections.\n\nAvoiding the doctor’s office could put patients at higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and spreading them, Sophocles said. If left untreated, some sexually transmitted infections can lead to lifelong consequences, such as infertility.\n\n“It’s the biggest opportunity cost that’s lost,” she said. Opill “is not a substitute to going to the clinic. You should still be seen by a clinician to have education and to know when to go.”\n\n‘Is Opill right for you?’\n\nWhile increasing access, adding Opill to the contraceptive toolkit relieves some of the stress surrounding contraception.\n\nIt means not having to scramble for or cram in a last-minute doctor’s appointment to secure pills before traveling. It means not risking an unwanted pregnancy if you run out before a refill, lose a pack or there’s a delay when changing providers.\n\nIt’s safe to temporarily switch to Opill from another progestin-only or combination birth control pill, Westhoff said, but it’s still important to consult a provider when choosing the right birth control.\n\nFor example, people with a history of breast cancer should not take the Opill, and those with abnormal vaginal bleeding should talk to a doctor first, experts say.\n\nOpill “provides an option to be able to access this form of contraception, but it doesn’t replace the patient provider relationship,” said Dr. Asima Ahmad, chief medical officer and co-founder of Carrot Fertility, a global fertility platform.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.\n\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Last summer, he started taking the medication himself, an approach called preexposure prophylaxis, better known as PrEP. The regimen requires laboratory tests every three months to ensure the powerful drug does not harm his kidneys and that he remains HIV-free.\n\nBut after his insurance company, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas, billed him hundreds of dollars for his PrEP lab test and a related doctor’s visit, Cantu panicked, fearing an avalanche of bills every few months for years to come.\n\n“I work in social services. I’m not rich. I told my doctor I can’t continue with PrEP,” said Cantu, who is gay. “It’s terrifying getting bills that high.”\n\nA national panel of health experts concluded in June 2019 that HIV prevention drugs, shown to lower the risk of infection from sex by more than 90%, are a critical weapon in quelling the AIDS epidemic. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, the decision to rate PrEP as an effective preventive service triggered rules requiring health insurers to cover the costs. Insurers were given until January 2021 to adhere to the ruling.\n\nFaced with pushback from the insurance industry, the Department of Labor clarified the rules in July 2021: Medical care associated with a PrEP prescription, including doctor appointments and lab tests, should be covered at no cost to patients.\n\nMore than half a year later, that federal prod hasn’t done the trick.\n\nIn California, Washington, Texas, Ohio, Georgia, and Florida, HIV advocates and clinic workers say patients are confounded by formularies that obfuscate drug costs and by erroneous bills for ancillary medical services. The costs can be daunting: a monthly supply of PrEP runs $60 for a generic and up to $2,000 for brand-name drugs like Truvada and Descovy. That doesn’t include quarterly lab tests and doctor visits, which can total $15,000 a year.\n\n“Insurers are quite smart, and they have a lot of staff,” said Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute. They are setting up “formularies in a way that looks like I’m going to have to pay, and that’s one of the barriers. They are not showing this is free for people in an easy way.”\n\nSchmid has found repeated violations: bewildering drug formularies that wrongly assign copays; PrEP drugs listed in the wrong tier. Some plans offer zero-cost access only to Descovy, a patented drug Gilead Sciences tested only in men and transgender women that is not authorized by the FDA for use by women who have vaginal sex.\n\nMore than 700,000 Americans have died from HIV-related illnesses since the AIDS epidemic emerged in 1981. But compared with its devastating impacts in the 1980s and ’90s, HIV is now largely a chronic disease in the U.S., managed with antiretroviral therapy that can suppress the virus to undetectable — and non-transmissible — levels. Public health officials now promote routine testing, condom use, and preexposure prophylaxis to prevent infections.\n\n“Contracting HIV or AIDS is not a fear of mine,” said Dan Waits, a 30-year-old gay man who lives in San Francisco. “I take PrEP as an afterthought. That’s a huge shift from a generation ago.”\n\nStill, 35,000 new infections occur each year in the U.S., according to KFF. Of those, 66% occur through sex between men; 23% through heterosexual sex; and 11% involve injecting illegal drugs. Black people represent nearly 40% of the 1.2 million U.S. residents living with HIV.\n\nHIV prevention drugs, including a long-lasting injectable approved by the FDA last December, are critical to reducing the rate of new infections among high-risk groups. But uptake has been sluggish. An estimated 1.2 million Americans at risk of HIV infection should be taking the pills, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but only 25% are doing so, and use among Black and Hispanic patients is especially low.\n\n“Until we can increase uptake of PrEP in these communities, we’re not going to be successful in bringing about an end to the HIV epidemic,” said Justin Smith, director of the Campaign to End AIDS at the Positive Impact Clinic in Atlanta. Atlanta has the second-highest rate of new HIV infections, after Washington, D.C.\n\nWomen remain a neglected group when it comes to PrEP education and treatment. In some urban areas, such as Baltimore, women account for 30% of people living with HIV. But women have been largely ignored by PrEP marketing efforts, said Dr. Rachel Scott, scientific director of women’s health research at the MedStar Health Research Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nScott runs a reproductive health clinic that cares for women with HIV and those at risk of infection. She counsels women whose sexual partners do not use condoms or whose partners have HIV and women who have transactional sex or share needles to consider the HIV prevention pill. Most, she said, are completely unaware a pill could help protect them.\n\nIn the years since Truvada, the first HIV prevention pill authorized by the FDA, was approved in 2012, lower-priced generic versions have entered the market. While a monthly supply of Truvada can cost $1,800, generic prescriptions are available for $30 to $60 a month.\n\nEven as medication costs have decreased, lab tests and other accompanying services are still being billed, advocates say. Many patients are unaware they do not have to pay out-of-pocket. Adam Roberts, a technology project manager in San Francisco, said his company’s health insurer, Aetna, has charged him $1,200 a year for the past three years for his quarterly lab tests.\n\n“I assumed that was the cost of being on the medication,” said Roberts, who learned about the issue from a friend last month.\n\nEnforcing coverage rules falls to state insurance commissioners and the Department of Labor, which oversees most employer-based health plans. But enforcement is driven largely by patient complaints, said Amy Killelea, an Arlington, Virginia-based lawyer who specializes in HIV policy and coverage.\n\n“It’s the employer-based plans that are problematic right now,” said Killelea, who works with clients to appeal charges with insurers and file complaints with state insurance commissioners. “The current system is not working. There need to be actual penalties for noncompliance.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Labor, Victoria Godinez, said that people who have concerns about their plan’s compliance with the requirements should contact the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEven as they push for broader enforcement, HIV organizations are taking one small victory at a time.\n\nOn Feb. 16, Anthony Cantu received a letter from the Texas Department of Insurance informing him that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas had reprocessed his claims for PrEP-related lab costs.

Wade, the case that established the federal right to an abortion, the next battle may be over access to abortion pills.\n\nSome states have restricted the practice, but in December, the US Food and Drug Administration relaxed certain federal regulations on what is now the most commonly used abortion method in the United States.\n\nWhat is medication abortion?\n\nMedication abortion, also known as abortion with pills or medical abortion, is a method by which someone ends their pregnancy by taking two pills, rather than having a surgical procedure.\n\nThe first pill is mifepristone, sold under the brand names Mifeprex or Korlym. It’s also known as RU 486. The second pill is called misoprostol.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nMifepristone blocks a hormone called progesterone, which the body needs for the pregnancy to continue. The hormone helps maintain the inside of the uterus. When the hormone is absent, the uterus will expel its contents.\n\nAfter taking mifepristone, the patient waits 24 to 48 hours to take misoprostol. That helps empty the uterus through bleeding and muscle contractions.\n\nThe drugs typically cause intense cramps and heavy bleeding for about 3 to 5 hours. A regular menstrual period will usually resume in a couple of weeks.\n\nWithin 14 days of taking the medicine, the patient will typically go back to a health clinic or doctor’s office for a follow-up appointment. A health care professional will do a lab test or an ultrasound to confirm that the abortion is complete. They will also check the patient for infection.\n\nWhen can you have a medication abortion?\n\nThe drugs can be taken immediately after someone learns that they’re pregnant, up to 11 weeks after the first day of the last menstrual period, depending on where the person lives. State laws vary.\n\nCan you get pregnant again after having it?\n\nYes, but a person who takes these drugs should use a birth control for at least a month afterward.\n\nWhen was the process approved?\n\nThe FDA approved mifepristone, coupled with misoprostol, for abortion use in 2000. This combination is also available in more than 60 other countries.\n\nIn 2016, the FDA approved a supplemental application from the maker of Mifeprex to change the regimen and the drug label.\n\nWho shouldn’t take the drugs?\n\nMedication abortion medicines shouldn’t be taken 70 or more days after the start of the last menstrual period.\n\nPeople who have certain health conditions or who have had an ectopic pregnancy, a rare event in which the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, shouldn’t have a medication abortion.\n\nIt’s not recommended for people who have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control, although the device can be removed before the medication abortion. People on long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy and those who are allergic to the drugs or similar medications also shouldn’t use them.\n\nPeople with anemia can take the drugs, but they may need more monitoring because of the bleeding that happens.\n\nHow many people use this method?\n\nThe number of people seeking abortions overall has fallen, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the percentage of people using an abortion pill has increased among those who chose to have an abortion. A February study from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights think tank, found that an estimated 54% of people chose this method in 2020. In 2017, 39% did.\n\nHow do you get the pills?\n\nUnlike with most medications that you can pick up at a nearby pharmacy, only a health care provider who is certified can order, prescribe and dispense the pills for a medication abortion.\n\nSince 2011, the medicine has come from a restricted program called the Mifepristone Shared REMS Program. REMS stands for Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, a program the FDA uses for specific drugs to make sure the benefit outweighs any risk. Typically, drugs are in this program have some complications or contraindications.\n\nThere are 62 drugs in REMS programs, including some cancer drugs, drugs used to treat MS, antipsychotics, opioids and testosterone. Drugs in this program usually require a provider to be certified to administer them, and some require the provider follow a specific plan to educate the patient about how the drug works.\n\nTelehealth is an option in some states. A person can consult with a provider by phone or text and then receive the pills by mail if the person lives in a state where abortion is legal.\n\n“The law of the patient’s location is what’s going to control if the person has access,” said Amanda Allen, senior counsel and director of the Lawyering Project, an organization that uses the law to improve abortion access.\n\nA person could also go to a state where abortion is legal and have the pills shipped there.\n\nAre the rules the same about access to abortion pills across the US?\n\nAccess to pills is not equal in all states.\n\nIn April 2021, the FDA allowed medication abortion pills to be sent by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic and said it would no longer enforce a rule that required women to get the first of the two pills in person at a clinic or hospital.\n\nIn December, it removed the requirement that mifepristone be dispensed only in certain health care settings. It added a requirement that pharmacies be certified to dispense it.\n\nAs of April, 32 states permit only licensed physicians to prescribe mifepristone pills according to the Guttmacher Institute. Nineteen require a clinician to be physically present when a person takes this medicine, that restricts the telemedicine option. Two states prohibit the use of medication abortion at a particular time in the pregnancy.\n\nSeven states put laws on the books that require providers to tell patients that the process could be reversed if they are given a high amount of progesterone, but scientific evidence does not support this claim. Similar laws in Arizona and North Dakota have been held up or delayed in court.\n\nThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and several other medical associations have long advocated for the removal of restrictions on how the drugs are administered.\n\nThe restrictions, the group argues, “do not make the care safer, are not based on medical evidence or need, and create barriers to clinician and patient access to medication abortion.”\n\nWill new state laws impact this form of abortion?\n\nAs of June, the Guttmacher Institute predicts at least 26 states are certain, or will likely, ban abortion to the “fullest extent possible.” There are 13 states with “trigger” laws that immediately or quickly ban abortion with a few exceptions. State laws do not seem to distinguish between medication or surgical abortion.\n\nIn June, Twenty two state attorneys general reaffirmed their commitment to expanding access to abortion care in their states.\n\nIt is not settled law yet as to whether states can ban the pills. On Friday, US Attorney General Merrick Garland promised to protect access.\n\n“We stand ready to work with other arms of the federal government that seek to use their lawful authorities to protect and preserve access to reproductive care,” Garland said in a statement. “In particular, the FDA has approved the use of the medication Mifepristone. States may not ban Mifepristone based on disagreement with the FDA’s expert judgment about its safety and efficacy.”\n\nIt is likely that the matter will have to be determined by the courts.\n\n“It’s a very interesting argument that the FDA actually preempts state laws in this instance, and it could be a creative legal theory for restoring some access,” said Allen.\n\nAre there side effects?\n\nStudies show that this abortion method is considered safe and highly effective.\n\nCommon side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, weakness and dizziness. These usually happen in the first 24 hours after taking the second drug.\n\nRare side effects include a fast heartbeat, fainting and fatal infections.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThere is a 0.4% risk of major complications. The associated mortality rate is less than 0.0001%, studies show.\n\nWhat if it doesn’t work?\n\nThe method works 99.6% of the time, studies show, if the pills are taken at nine weeks of pregnancy or sooner. In weeks nine through 10, it works 91% to 93% of the time; it works about 87% of the time in weeks 10 through 11.\n\nIf the abortion is not complete, the woman may need to take the medicine again. In rare cases, they may have to have a surgical abortion.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/health/drug-shortages-explainer/index.html", "title": "Empty pharmacy shelves shine a light on vulnerabilities in US drug ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nScarcity of several high-profile prescription drugs, such as the antibiotic amoxicillin and the ADHD treatment Adderall, have had some patients searching pharmacies and rationing pills, and now parents in some areas are having to hunt to find over-the-counter pain- and fever-reducing medications for their sick kids.\n\nSo what’s going with the availability of medications in the United States?\n\nNothing too unusual, experts say. Even when demand is not sky-high, drugs shortages happen regularly – but usually more quietly – in the US.\n\nShortages “hit a lot of different patient populations with different drugs and whatnot, but many of those don’t get a lot of headline news because they’re very niche,” said David Margraf, a pharmaceutical research scientist with the Resilient Drug Supply Project at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nAt any time, the reasons why shelves may be empty vary from place to place and from drug to drug. Each shortage has its own particular factors.\n\n“They’re all a different tale,” Margraf said. “There’s commonalities between them, but each one is a little bit different and it’s very tedious trying to figure out what’s going on sometimes.”\n\nSome drugs are generally more vulnerable to shortage due to a lack of economic incentives to produce them.\n\nSometimes, manufacturing disruptions, labor issues or ingredient shortages will reduce availability. While the US is a major developer of new medications for the world, it is also heavily dependent on other countries for the manufacturing of those drugs.\n\nMany of the raw ingredients that go in to making drugs are sourced from just two countries, China and India, says Bindiya Vakil, chief executive officer of Resilinc, a company that maps and monitors pharmaceutical supply chains with the aim of giving an early warning to clients when trouble is on the way. Any disruption in China or India, such as work stoppage at a factory due to China’s strict zero Covid policy, which was only recently eased, may have a ripple effect on the supplies of many products, including medications.\n\nEven with normal levels of production, high demand during a tough cold and flu season – like the one the US is experiencing – can make it hard for families to find what they’re looking for.\n\nWhitney Hemsath, a writer and mother of four living in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota, said she has been noticing how little children’s medication has been on store shelves for a few weeks, but she wasn’t too worried since the family still had some at home.\n\nLast week, though, her 4-year-old woke up in the middle of the night with a painful ear infection, and she got an unpleasant surprise: They were out of pain medication.\n\nShe started looking for a store that was open at 5:30 a.m., and found one with three bottles of children’s acetaminophen left. There was no ibuprofen, which lasts longer, and no generics or store brands. While she was grateful to find something, she says the family is on a tight budget while her husband finishes his Ph.D., so paying for the brand name medicine was frustrating.\n\nLater that day, their pediatrician confirmed the ear infection and prescribed the antibiotic amoxicillin. He called the prescription into a chain pharmacy, but gave her a written copy, too, in case it was difficult to find. Sure enough, the first pharmacy was out, and so was the next. Based on the pharmacist’s list, she called her doctor to change her son’s prescription – but the pharmacy didn’t take their insurance and the alternative medication was too expensive.\n\nFinally, she was able to find another chain pharmacy that had amoxicillin and took their insurance.\n\nHer son is doing better now, and she said she feels bad complaining because she was lucky to find what she needed – but it took time and effort she wasn’t used to.\n\n“It never used to be like this,” she said. “There were always so many options and well stocked shelves before … now you’re lucky if they have one type of any brand of the medicine that you want.\n\n“The security of knowing I can go to the store or doctor and get my kids the medicine they need is gone,” she said. “It’s been replaced by this ever-present worry that the shelves might be empty.”\n\nSurging demand cleans shelves\n\nRight now, pain and fever medications for children, especially liquid formulations, are in short supply in some places because of a trio of viral illnesses – flu, RSV and Covid-19 – hitting the United States at the same time, creating unprecedented demand. Many pediatricians say they can’t remember ever seeing so many kids this sick at the same time.\n\nBare shelves in some stores may seem reminiscent of this year’s baby formula shortage, but the situations aren’t quite the same. With formula, a major manufacturer recalled products and shut down one of its factories and conducted a nationwide recall after the government found quality problems at the production facility, taking it offline for months. The shutdown exacerbated existing supply chain problems, leaving shelves empty.\n\nWith children’s medications, drug manufacturers say they are running full-tilt, and they planned for some increase in sales over the winter months. But they didn’t know it would be this bad or start this early.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents producers of over-the-counter medications, major US manufacturers of children’s medications – including Perrigo in Michigan and Johnson & Johnson in Pennsylvania – are “operating facilities 24 hours a day, 7 days a week” to keep up.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration also says it is keeping a close eye on the situation and “talking daily” with manufacturers to find ways to increase supply.\n\n“The ibuprofen and acetaminophen and children’s formulations, we’re monitoring those really closely at this time,” said an FDA official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details of the agency’s work.\n\n“There are not any manufacturing problems, so there’s not anything that’s slowing production down or causing these shortages as far as manufacturing. In fact, manufacturers are working very closely with us and increasing supply so that we can get the demand where the priority needs to be,” the official said.\n\nThe official said the FDA is able to help increase supply by identifying new sources of raw materials to facilitate additional production. The agency can also assist with identifying additional manufacturing sites and “expediting review of anything related to increase in production.”\n\nThe official would not confirm details of specific requests from the companies for help. “I can say they are picking up on those offers, and they’re working very closely with us,” the official said.\n\nUnderstanding drug shortages\n\nIn the United States, there are groups tracking and watching shortages and potential shortages.\n\nThe American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists, a nonprofit representing pharmacists that work in hospitals, tracks drug shortages in the US by taking reports of shortages from anyone and then checking with manufacturers to verify them. It defines drug shortages as supply issues that affect how a pharmacy prepares or dispenses a drug product or influences patient care if providers have to seek an alternative.\n\nIts data shows that there were 260 active drug shortages at the end of September, down slightly from the 264 active shortages reported during the second quarter of 2022 but near the all-time high of 282 active shortages reported during the second quarter of 2019.\n\nThe FDA tracks drug shortages too, taking reports directly from manufacturers, but it defines them differently than the pharmacists’ group. The agency considers a drug to be in shortage when the total supply of all versions of a commercially available product cannot meet the current demand and a registered alternative manufacturer will not meet the current or projected demands, leaving patients in a lurch.\n\nThe FDA says that by its count, the number of drugs reported in shortage has actually fallen from a high of 251 in 2011. There were 41 drug shortages tracked by the FDA in 2021, for example. That same year, the agency says, it averted 317 shortages.\n\nIn a 2019 report, a task force commissioned by the FDA acknowledged that drug shortages are a “persistent problem” and that when they happen, they can be tough to remedy. In some cases, they can last years.\n\nAdderall, for example, saw a sharp increase in demand from 2020 to 2021. At the same time, Teva, a leading manufacturer, reported delays due to worker shortages. The company has told CNN the worker shortage has been resolved.\n\nBecause Adderall is a controlled substance, it is tightly regulated by the government. The Drug Enforcement Administration limits how much can be produced to avoid patient abuse.\n\nAll this means Adderall is likely to remain in shortage into 2023, says University of Minnesota’s Margraf.\n\nCertain drugs are more vulnerable\n\nMost of the drugs that seem to disappear are inexpensive generics given by injection. These “sterile injectables” have stringent manufacturing requirements that make them costly to produce, and they have slimmer profit margins, so there’s less economic incentive for companies to make them.\n\nOther generics – like many antibiotics – are vulnerable to shortages, too. Experts say that’s what happened recently to some formulations of amoxicillin.\n\nCompanies produce generic drugs to order. They don’t keep stocks on shelves in a warehouse. Some manufacturers say this year’s orders didn’t anticipate the high demand. Even when companies realize there’s a shortfall, it may take weeks or months for them to make and ship more product.\n\n“Really, it comes down to economics,” said Vimala Raghavendran, senior director of the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Center at the U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit that at sets quality standards for dietary supplements, food and medications.\n\nFor the past three years, USP has been tracking pharmaceutical supply chains through its Medicine Supply Map in order to help identify and head off potential shortages.\n\n“Antibiotics are 42% more likely to be in shortage compared to other classes of drugs. They have lower price points, so there’s less incentive for manufacturers to invest in excess capacity,” Raghavendran said.\n\n“And then you throw in an unexpected shock, like a demand increase because of the surge in RSV and the flu and Covid, and the supply chain is not able to absorb that shock,” she added.\n\nStaying ahead of shortages\n\nThere are some systems in place to stay ahead of shortages. The FDA requires manufacturers to notify it if there is anything that would disrupt the manufacturing or supply of a drug, and in many cases, that allows the agency to head off problems.\n\nHowever, companies are not currently required to notify the FDA of increased demand.\n\n“But that’s something we’re really encouraging companies to do, let us know if there’s a spike in demand so that we can work with them early on, just as they can with supply disruptions,” the official told CNN.\n\nThe White House says drug shortages are a priority for President Biden’s administration, too.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nIt points to Biden’s Executive Order on America’s Supply Chains, signed in February 2021, which directed the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to identify and report risks in the supply chain for pharmaceuticals and their active ingredients and to make recommendations to address those risks.\n\n“HHS, for the first time in its history, has established a new dedicated public health industrial base expansion and supply chain management office, with the goal of building resilience,” White House spokesperson Kevin Munoz wrote in an email to CNN.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/16/health/abortion-texas-sepsis/index.html", "title": "Texas woman almost dies because she couldn't get an abortion | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAnother woman has come forward with the harrowing details of how the Supreme Court’s decision four months ago to overturn Roe v.

Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.\n\nBut Josh does.\n\n“It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”\n\nFamily members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.\n\nDoctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.\n\n‘These barbaric laws’\n\nBut her medical ordeal isn’t over.\n\nAmanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.\n\nThat leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.\n\n“[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”\n\nThe Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way.\n\n“Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.\n\n“Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.\n\nIn many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible. And they have good jobs with good health insurance and they live in a big city with high quality health care.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“All of these things I had going for me, and still, this was the outcome,” she said.\n\nShe and Josh worry about women in rural areas, or poor women, or young, single mothers in states like Texas.

It’s happening in part due to surging demand for Adderall and intermittent manufacturing delays at Teva Pharmaceuticals, one of the leading makers of the drug, which is primarily used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\nAmid this increased demand, other manufactures are also experiencing shortages.\n\nIt’s a problem that affects a growing number of Americans.\n\nA report from data analytics firm Trilliant Health found that nationally, prescriptions for Adderall among people ages 22 to 44 increased 15% between 2020 and 2021. There was also a slight uptick in prescriptions among people 45 and older.\n\nDr. David Goodman, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said that for the past several months, his patients have had to wait several days to fill their prescriptions. Lately, they’re having to wait up to a week or two. Some were even told that pharmacies might not see new supplies for months.\n\nA lack of access to Adderall, which must be taken daily, can have implications for careers, home lives and even safety, Goodman said.\n\n“This can come down to the difference between stopping at the red light or running the red light because you got distracted,” he said.\n\nAt home, it can mean being a less attentive member of the family, being unable to regulate your emotions and feeling more irritable, increasing conflicts. At work, it may mean increased impulsivity and tardiness, making the person seem like an unreliable worker.\n\n“I’ve had patients call 10,15, 20 pharmacies in order to get their medication,” Goodman said. “Now imagine you’re sitting on the phone, desperate to get needed medication, and pharmacy after pharmacy after pharmacy is telling you either they can’t tell you or they don’t have any, and ‘we can’t tell you when we’re going to get it,’ and that’s where the panic sets in.”\n\nOver time, these incidents can take a serious toll on a patient’s mental health.\n\n‘You can’t get this anywhere’\n\nClara Pitts is what her mom describes as an overachiever. The 17-year-old from Taylorsville, Utah, is a National Merit Scholar and is constantly busy with studying and schoolwork.\n\nWithout medication, Clara experiences something known as ADHD paralysis: She might have a long list of things to accomplish and knows she needs to get through it, but she struggles to stop whatever other activity she is doing.\n\n“She’s constantly trying to accommodate,” Rebekah Pitts said. “She has a really detailed spreadsheet online where she puts everything she needs to do to try to help herself to compensate, but the difference between being on [Adderall] and not on it is more of a scale – that it’s easier for her to stay focused.”\n\nRebekah has called eight local pharmacies on behalf of her daughter since the FDA announced the shortage, and each one turned up empty. She was told Clara could have to wait up to two months to get the medication.\n\n“As a parent, I was surprised at how upset I felt,” Rebekah said. “I was crying, and it caused me to be just exhausted. By the end of the day, I just crashed. I was like, ‘Wow, this has really taken a toll on me,’ and I think I’ve realized I’m accustomed to being able to get medication when I have a prescription. I have never in my life tried to fill a prescription and been told ‘you can’t get this anywhere.’ “\n\nWhen CNN talked to Clara in late October, her prescription bottle had eight pills left, enough to last four days. But with college applications looming and the stress of senior year, Clara was rationing the pills for the moments when she needs absolute focus.\n\n“Sometimes, my resting heart rate is elevated when I’m just sitting down thinking about my applications,” Clara said.\n\nClara is headed to her doctor to seek an alternative medication until Adderall is back in stock.\n\nRationing pills\n\nAshley Jordan, 24, of Colorado said she is also having to save her pills for when she needs them most.\n\nShe has been taking Teva’s version of Adderall for over seven years for ADHD and was surprised to find in August that her pharmacy had given her a different brand without telling her, because it was all they had.\n\nHowever, the new brand was not a good fit. “I was getting sick and throwing up every day I took it,” she said.\n\nNow, she’s rationing the few Teva pills she has left.\n\n“I’ve pretty much had to try to get as much done as possible when taking the pills to avoid struggling without them,” she said, “so I’ve pretty much just been in overdrive since it happened.”\n\nMikey DeDona, 22, of Boston takes Adderall for type 1 narcolepsy. This condition makes it hard for him to regulate his sleep. It can look like lots of low-quality sleep or even insomnia.\n\nIt took five days for his pharmacy to fill his prescription in late October, and those days took a toll.\n\n“It’s just knowing that I’m not going to be even 50% throughout the day,” DeDona said.\n\nWithout Adderall, it was much more difficult for DeDona to get out of bed, and he needed several naps throughout the day. Suddenly going without the medication also caused headaches and confusion.\n\n“It sucks to not be able to do anything, against your own will,” DeDona said, “You immediately have to be reminded of how bad it is without medication.”\n\nHe was finally able to fill his prescription last month but worries about availability in the months ahead, as he doesn’t want to try an alternative medication.\n\nGoodman says there are pros and cons to trying different meds. “The plus is, here’s an opportunity to change medicine and see if there’s a subjective improvement in the experience of the medication. … The downside to this is that the stimulants are not equally substitutable.”\n\nGoodman said new medications could also bring new side effects such as sleep issues, mood changes and headaches.\n\nSearching for safe alternatives\n\nMany people who have trouble finding Adderall in stock are looking for alternatives. Hundreds of social media accounts claim to have the medication available, and some people are turning to friends who no longer use the pills they were prescribed.\n\nGoodman strongly warns against this, offering a reminder that not only is selling your own prescription medication a felony, so is sharing it with others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe also emphasized that buying pills from social media or dealers is incredibly dangerous.\n\nIn October, the US Department of Justice charged 23 people with trafficking counterfeit pills after seizing over 74,000 counterfeit pills – including counterfeit Adderall laced with methamphetamine.\n\n“Remember, if you’re not getting your pills by a medical prescriber and they’re not dispensed to you by an authorized pharmacy, you’re taking literally your life into your hands,” Goodman said.", "authors": ["Raenu Charles"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/health/rainbow-fentanyl-pills-wellness/index.html", "title": "What is rainbow fentanyl? Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}]}

The US doesn't really ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US has few ways to track the substantial supply of anti-tank, anti-aircraft and other weaponry it has sent across the border into Ukraine, sources tell CNN, a blind spot that’s due in large part to the lack of US boots on the ground in the country – and the easy portability of many of the smaller systems now pouring across the border.\n\nIt’s a conscious risk the Biden administration is willing to take.\n\nIn the short term, the US sees the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of equipment to be vital to the Ukrainians’ ability to hold off Moscow’s invasion. A senior defense official said Tuesday that it is “certainly the largest recent supply to a partner country in a conflict.” But the risk, both current US officials and defense analysts say, is that in the long term, some of those weapons may wind up in the hands of other militaries and militias that the US did not intend to arm.\n\n“We have fidelity for a short time, but when it enters the fog of war, we have almost zero,” said one source briefed on US intelligence. “It drops into a big black hole, and you have almost no sense of it at all after a short period of time.”\n\nIn making the decision to send billions of dollars of weapons and equipment into Ukraine, the Biden administration factored in the risk that some of the shipments may ultimately end up in unexpected places, a defense official said.\n\nBut right now, the official said, the administration views a failure to adequately arm Ukraine as a greater risk.\n\nBecause the US military is not on the ground, the US and NATO are heavily reliant on information provided by Ukraine’s government. Privately, officials recognize that Ukraine has an incentive to give only information that will bolster their case for more aid, more arms and more diplomatic assistance.\n\n“It’s a war – everything they do and say publicly is designed to help them win the war. Every public statement is an information operation, every interview, every Zelensky appearance broadcast is an information operation,” said another source familiar with western intelligence. “It doesn’t mean they’re wrong to do it in any way.”\n\nFor months, US and western officials have offered detailed accounts about what the West knows about the status of Russian forces inside Ukraine: how many casualties they’ve taken, their remaining combat power, their weapons stocks, what kinds of munitions they are using and where.\n\nBut when it comes to Ukrainian forces, officials acknowledge that the West – including the US – has some information gaps.\n\nWestern estimates of Ukrainian casualties are also foggy, according to two sources familiar with US and western intelligence.\n\n“It’s hard to track with nobody on the ground,” said one source familiar with the intelligence.\n\nVisibility Questions\n\nThe Biden administration and NATO countries say they are providing weapons to Ukraine based on what the Ukrainian forces say they need, whether it’s portable systems like Javelin and Stinger missiles or the Slovakian S-300 air defense system that was sent over the last week.\n\nJavelin and Stinger missiles and rifles and ammunition are naturally harder to track than larger systems like the S-300, which was shipped by rail. Although Javelins have serial numbers, there is little way to track their transfer and use in real time, sources familiar with the matter say.\n\nLast week the US agreed to provide Kyiv with the types of high-power capabilities some Biden administration officials viewed as too much of an escalation risk a few short weeks ago, including 11 Mi-17 helicopters, 18 155 mm Howitzer cannons and 300 more Switchblade drones. But much of that support hasn’t yet come online — and the Switchblades are mobile, one-time use drones that would also likely be difficult to track after the fact.\n\n“I couldn’t tell you where they are in Ukraine and whether the Ukrainians are using them at this point,” a senior defense official told reporters last week. “They’re not telling us every round of ammunition they’re firing and who and at when. We may never know exactly to what degree they’ve using the Switchblades.”\n\nThe Defense Department doesn’t earmark the weapons it sends for particular units, according to Pentagon press secretary John Kirby.\n\nTrucks loaded with pallets of arms provided by the Defense Department are picked up by Ukrainian armed forces – primarily in Poland – and then driven into Ukraine, Kirby said, “then it’s up to the Ukrainians to determine where they go and how they’re allocated inside their country.”\n\nA congressional source pointed out that while the US is not on the ground in Ukraine, the US has tools to learn what’s happening beyond what the Ukrainians are saying, noting the US has extensive use of satellite imagery and both the Ukrainian and Russian militaries appear to be using commercial communications equipment.\n\nAnother congressional source said the US military’s views the information it’s receiving from Ukraine as generally reliable because the US has trained and equipped the Ukrainian military for eight years now, developing strong relationships. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t some blind spots, the source said, such as on issues like the operational status of Ukraine’s S-300s.\n\nJordan Cohen, a defense and foreign policy analyst at the CATO institute who focuses on arms sales, said the biggest danger surrounding the flood of weapons being funneled into Ukraine is what happens to them when the war ends or transitions into some kind of protracted stalemate.\n\nSuch a risk is part of any consideration to send weapons overseas. For decades, the US sent arms into Afghanistan, first to arm the mujahideen in their fight against the Soviet army, then to arm Afghan forces in their fight against the Taliban.\n\nInevitably, some weapons ended up on the black market including anti-aircraft Stinger missiles, the same kind the US is now providing to Ukraine.\n\nThe United States famously scrambled to recover Stingers after the Soviet war in Afghanistan. It wasn’t successful in finding all of them and when the US itself invaded Afghanistan in 2001, some officials feared that they could be used by the Taliban against the United States.\n\nOther weapons have ended up arming US adversaries. Much of what the US left behind to help Afghan forces became part of the Taliban arsenal after the collapse of the Afghan government and military.\n\nThe problem is not unique to Afghanistan. Weapons sold to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates found their way into the hands of fighters linked to al-Qaeda and Iran.\n\nThe risk of a similar scenario happening in Ukraine also exists, the defense official acknowledged. In 2020, the Defense Department inspector general released a report raising concerns about the end-use monitoring of weapons being sent to Ukraine.\n\nBut given the nearly insatiable short-term needs of Ukrainian forces for more arms and ammunition, the long-term risk of weapons ending up on the black market or in the wrong hands was deemed acceptable, the official said.\n\n“This could be a problem 10 years down the line, but that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be something we’re thinking about,” Cohen, the CATO analyst, said. “Over 50 million rounds of ammunition – all that ammunition isn’t just going to be used to fight Russians. Eventually that ammunition is going to be misused, whether intentionally or not.”\n\nThe Russian Threat\n\nOfficials are less concerned – at least for now – that the weapons will fall into the hands of the Russians. The source briefed on the intelligence noted that Russia’s failure to hold large swaths of territory or force the surrender of many Ukrainian units means that those arms have either been used or remain Ukrainian hands.\n\nAnd so far, it appears that Russia has struggled to intercept or destroy the supply shipments. A third source familiar with the intelligence said that it does not appear that Russia has been actively attacking western weapons shipments entering Ukraine – although it is unclear exactly why, especially since the US has intelligence that the Russians want to and have discussed doing so both publicly and privately.\n\nThere are a number of theories for why the shipments have so far been spared, this person added, including that Russian forces simply can’t find them – the weapons and equipment are being sent over in unmarked vehicles and often transported at night. It could also be that the Russian forces are running out of munitions and don’t want to waste them targeting random trucks unless they can be certain they are part of an arms convoy.\n\nThough on Monday Russian claimed it had destroyed a depot “near Lviv,” which held “large consignments” of weapons provided to Ukraine by the United States and European countries. CNN has not been able to verify the claim.\n\nBut broadly, Russia doesn’t have perfect intelligence visibility into Ukraine, either, this source noted, and their air capabilities over western Ukraine, where the shipments are coming in, are extremely limited because of Ukrainian air defense systems.\n\nPublicly, the Pentagon says it has not yet seen Russian attempts to disrupt the weapons transfers or the shipments moving inside Ukraine.\n\n“Flights are still going into trans-shipment sites in the region. And ground movement is still occurring of this material inside Ukraine. Every single day, there are the security assistance, weapons and material and support equipment that is getting into Ukrainian hands,” Kirby said Thursday.\n\n“We’re going to keep doing that as much as we can, as fast as we can. We have not seen any Russian efforts to interdict that flow. And so we’re just going to keep doing it,” he added. “We constantly look at it every day monitor it, change it, adapt it as needed.”", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Jeremy Herb Natasha Bertrand Oren Liebermann", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Jeremy Herb", "Natasha Bertrand", "Oren Liebermann"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/23/politics/us-russia-war-crimes/index.html", "title": "US formally declares Russian military has committed war crimes in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US government has formally declared that members of the Russian armed forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe official US declaration that Moscow’s troops had violated the laws of conflict comes after Blinken, President Joe Biden and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman all said it was their personal opinion that war crimes have taken place.\n\n“Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,” Blinken said in a statement.\n\n“Our assessment is based on a careful review of available information from public and intelligence sources,” he said.\n\nThe decision to issue a formal accusation marks a significant step by the US government after weeks of declining to officially say that the attacks committed against civilians in Ukraine were war crimes. It remains to be seen, however, whether there will be any accountability for those accused of carrying out the alleged crimes, and whether Russian President Vladimir Putin himself will be forced to bear any responsibility.\n\nLast week, Biden accused Putin of war crimes. “I think he is a war criminal,” Biden said after remarks at the White House.\n\n“As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases,” Blinken said Wednesday. “The US government will continue to track reports of war crimes and will share information we gather with allies, partners, and international institutions and organizations, as appropriate. We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions.”\n\nBlinken’s statement cited “credible reports” of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, including the destruction of apartment buildings, schools and hospitals. The State Department specifically cited attacks on a maternity hospital and theater in Mariupol. The theater, the State Department said, was marked with the Russian word for “children” in letters visible from the sky.\n\nBeth Van Schaack, the US ambassador at large for global criminal justice, said she could not go into details about which incidents the US has assessed are war crimes and that the US is “looking at the broad range that Russia’s forces are engaged in” in Ukraine.\n\n“This is going to be an ongoing process throughout this conflict,” she said at a State Department briefing.\n\nVan Schaack noted that, “as with any alleged crime, ultimately, it will be for a court of law to determine individual criminal responsibility who is directly responsible for these particular cases.”\n\nAsked if Putin is liable for the actions of members of his country’s armed forces – who the US has accused of committing war crimes – Van Schaack said “there are doctrines under international law and domestic law that are able to reach all the way up the chain of command.”\n\n“The US government will continue to track reports coming out of Ukraine of war crimes, and we will share this information with our friends and allies and with international and multilateral institutions as appropriate.

They have no clue where they are going and how to really communicate with each other properly.”\n\nTapping into their radio frequencies was “basically like tapping into a police frequency in the US”, said Cardillo, who claimed to have heard “proof of war crimes”, including orders to fire ballistic missiles into civilian areas.\n\n“There were periods where we heard [Russian soldiers] crying in combat, a period where they were insulting each other – obviously not a sign of great morale,” he added.\n\n“There was an instance where they shot at each other, there was an instance where they had to transport dead bodies back to their forward operating bases. Many times you can hear them not at their highest level of happiness.”\n\nThe NYT has reported claims by an unnamed senior Pentagon official that “entire Russian units have laid down their arms without a fight after confronting a surprisingly stiff Ukrainian defence”.\n\nA “significant number” of the Russian troops were said to be young conscripts “who are poorly trained and ill-prepared” for the invasion.\n\nSome have “deliberately punched holes in their vehicles’ gas tanks, presumably to avoid combat”, the paper said.\n\nThe Economist’s defence editor Shashank Joshi tweeted that a US Department of Defence source had confirmed the self-sabotage claim, telling him: “I can say with certainty this is happening.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the UN has painted a similar picture, by revealing the contents of texts alleged to have been sent by a Russian soldier to his mother shortly before his death.\n\nThe unnamed soldier said Russian troops were “shooting everyone, including civilians”, and that he wanted to “hang” himself, ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told a special UN session on Monday on Moscow’s aggression.\n\n“There’s a real war going on here,” the soldier wrote. “They told us Ukrainians would greet us peacefully, but they are throwing themselves under our machinery, not letting us pass. They call us fascists, Mum.”\n\nThe NYT suggested the combination of low morale and logistical issues “may help explain why Russian forces, including an ominous 40-mile convoy of tanks and armoured vehicles near Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, have come to a near crawl”.\n\nThe Pentagon source reportedly told the paper that Russian commanders leading the column might also be “regrouping and rethinking” ahead of a fresh push to capture the city.\n\nShaken conscripts\n\n“Mounting evidence” from messages sent to Russia from the front lines “suggest the Kremlin had convinced Russian troops that they would meet little resistance in Ukraine and instead be treated as conquering heroes”, The Telegraph said.\n\nRussian state media “denied plans to invade Ukraine before Thursday's all-out assault”, but had also suggested that Ukrainians “were so deeply unhappy with their government that they would welcome Russian soldiers”.\n\nBut “the opposite is proving to be the case”, the paper continued, with Ukraine’s military staging a fierce fightback and releasing “myriad videos” in which “captive Russian troops claim they had no idea they would be sent” into the neighbouring country.\n\nWith young soldiers already “abandoning gear, deserting, and showing other signs of strain, an urgent push to further erode Russian morale could throw Vladimir Putin’s tottering military into complete disarray”, said Forbes defence writer Craig Hooper.\n\nPutin “kept the average Russian soldier in the dark about the Ukraine invasion” and they “know nothing about the war they are fighting”, he wrote. They are now “vulnerable to suggestion”, so “a massive, no-holds-barred effort to educate and further demoralise Russian soldiers” would “likely pay enormous dividends”.\n\nMujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy, tweeted earlier this week that ideas being discussed in Brussels included “offering asylum and refugee status for soldiers that want to desert the Russian army – to incentivise defections – as long as they have not committed war crimes”.\n\nThere are undoubtedly “signs of poor morale in some units”, said The Economist, with footage circulating online showing “at least one tank column hurriedly reversing after being confronted by unarmed civilians”.\n\nBut “the bulk of Russian forces” are closing in on Kyiv”.\n\n“The woes of the Russian war machine are big and real”, the paper continued. The more important question, however, is whether they are also “temporary”.\n\n“Rockets and cluster munitions have begun targeting residential areas” and “images show corpses littering the streets”, suggesting that a sizeable number of troops are still following orders, no matter how “grim” the outcome.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Elliott Goat", "The Week Uk", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/03/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/30/politics/ukraine-hack-russian-ransomware-gang/index.html", "title": "'I can fight with a keyboard': How one Ukrainian IT specialist ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAs Russian artillery began raining down on his homeland last month, one Ukrainian computer researcher decided to fight back the best way he knew how – by sabotaging one of the most formidable ransomware gangs in Russia.\n\nFour days into Russia’s invasion, the researcher began publishing the biggest leak ever of files and data from Conti, a syndicate of Russian and Eastern Europe cybercriminals wanted by the FBI for conducting attacks on hundreds of US organizations and causing millions of dollars in losses.\n\nThe thousands of internal documents and communications include evidence that appears to suggest Conti operatives have contacts within the Russian government, including the FSB intelligence service. That supports a longstanding US allegation that Moscow has colluded with cybercriminals for strategic advantage.\n\nThe Ukrainian computer specialist behind the leak spoke exclusively to CNN and described his motivation for seeking revenge after Conti operatives published a statement in support of the Russian government immediately after the invasion of Ukraine. He also described his desperate efforts to track down loved ones in Ukraine in recent weeks.\n\nTo protect his identity, CNN agreed to refer to him by a pseudonym: Danylo.\n\n“I cannot shoot anything, but I can fight with a keyboard and mouse,” Danylo told CNN.\n\nService members of pro-Russian troops drive armoured vehicles past local residents in the course of Ukraine-Russia conflict in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol, Ukraine March 24, 2022. Alexander Ermochenko/Reuters\n\nThe trove of data Danylo leaked in late February illustrates why cybersecurity has been such a fraught issue in US-Russia relations. It includes cryptocurrency accounts the Conti hackers used to allegedly reap millions of dollars in ransom payments, their discussions of how to extort US companies and their apparent targeting of a journalist investigating the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny.\n\nBut it also shows how hard it can be to disable ransomware operations. Despite Danylo unmasking their operations, the hackers continue to announce new victim organizations.\n\nDanylo, who has worked as a cybersecurity researcher for years and studied the underground cybercriminal economy in Europe, is just one vigilante in a shadow war that has emerged between hackers and cybersecurity executives who have pledged support for the Ukrainian and Russian governments as the biggest land war in Europe since World War II drags on.\n\nBut by disrupting a group as notorious as Conti, Danylo has gained more attention than others. The FBI, Danylo said, contacted him after he began to leak the Conti files, asking him to stop leaking.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment.\n\nFirefighters work to extinguish a fire at a warehouse after it was hit by Russian shelling on March 28, 2022 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nCNN corroborated Danylo’s claim that he was the leaker by reviewing evidence that he had access to the Twitter account that was publishing the Conti data, as well as a website that Danylo and another person, who was granted anonymity for their protection, were using to share data contained in the leaks.\n\nDanylo hasn’t spoken with the media about his motives – until now. He did so while navigating a war-ravaged country he had only recently returned to and could hardly recognize.\n\n“It’s my country,” he said in a phone interview. “If they [the Ukrainian government] provide me weapons, OK, I’ll go fight. But I’m better at typing.”\n\nDigital retribution\n\nDanylo claims that he first gained access to computer systems used by what would become the Conti syndicate in 2016. Though he declined to explain in detail how he did this, independent security experts have verified to CNN the dataset belongs to the hackers. (Conti is both the name of malicious software and the cybercriminal syndicate that uses it. The group is also affiliated with TrickBot, another hacking tool used in numerous ransomware attacks.)\n\n“Sometimes they make mistakes,” Danylo said, referring to ransomware groups. “You need to catch them when they make a mistake. I just was in the right place at the right time. I was monitoring them.”\n\nFor years, Danylo said, he quietly lurked on the hackers’ computer servers and would pass along information on the group’s operations to European law enforcement officials.\n\nConti ransomware has been rampant in the last two years, with the hackers claiming numerous victims a week.\n\nIn September 2020, the hackers claimed to have stolen case files from a district court in Louisiana. In March 2021, Conti ransomware was used in a hack that hobbled the computer networks of Ireland’s $25 billion public health system, disrupting a maternity ward in Dublin.\n\nThe dark work was lucrative: hackers using the Conti ransomware received at least $25.5 million in ransom payments in the span of just four months in 2021, according to Elliptic, a firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nCollapsed building is seen as civilians are evacuated along humanitarian corridors from the Ukrainian city of Mariupol under the control of Russian military and pro-Russian separatists, on March 26, 2022. Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nBut something snapped in Danylo on February 25, 2022, when Conti operatives published a statement pledging their “full support” for the Russian government as it attacked Ukraine.\n\nA Russian airstrike had landed not far from a family member’s house. The cybersecurity researcher grew up in Ukraine when it was part of the Soviet Union. He didn’t want to see it slip back into Russian hands.\n\nConti members tried to walk their statement back, claiming they weren’t supporting any government, but Danylo had heard enough.\n\nAsked again why he dumped the Conti data, Danylo said with a laugh: “To prove that they are motherf**kers.” He was exhausted from a long day navigating military checkpoints in Ukraine, on the hunt for cigarettes and looking to the sky for signs of the next air raid.\n\nConti is exactly the type of prolific ransomware group that President Joe Biden last year exhorted Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring to heel amid a spate of attacks on US critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Kremlin appeared to dangle the prospect of collaborating with the US to combat cybercrime this January, when the Russian FSB intelligence agency announced the arrest of multiple accused cybercriminals. But the chances of bilateral cooperation on cybercrime have dimmed following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has killed more than 1,000 civilians, according to the United Nations, and made Putin an international pariah.\n\nCivilians trapped in Mariupol city under Russian attacks, are evacuated in groups under the control of pro-Russian separatists, through other cities, in Mariupol, Ukraine on March 20, 2022. Stringer/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAfter he started leaking the data, Danylo said, an FBI special agent contacted him and asked him to stop. Exposing Conti infrastructure could, in theory, make it more difficult for the FBI to track the group because it might set up new computer systems.\n\nDanylo has stopped leaking for now. But he says he still has access to some Conti computer systems.\n\nAt least one law enforcement official who spoke to CNN would have preferred that Danylo had maintained that covert access, rather than alert the ransomware syndicate to his presence by leaking the data.\n\n“Publicly releasing information like [the leaker did] is reckless,” a US law enforcement official told CNN. “Working cooperatively with law enforcement can achieve a more substantial and lasting impact in disrupting the operations of groups like Conti.”\n\nBut John Fokker, a former cybercrime investigator with the Dutch police, said the leak could actually be useful to cops chasing cyber crooks.\n\n“Yes, infrastructure can be burned. However, the amount of data provided in the leaks make me confident that law enforcement got the information they need to write indictments on key individuals,” said Fokker, who works closely with European law enforcement as head of cyber investigations at security firm Trellix.\n\nA catalog of misdeeds\n\nThe Conti leaks are a startling catalog of the alleged misdeeds of a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise.\n\nCNN evaluated and translated the original cache of documents that Danylo shared with the world via Twitter.\n\nThe communications show Conti members, each going by aliases in the chat logs, discussing the wisdom of extorting US small businesses, seemingly refraining from hacking Russian targets, and taking an interest in a journalist writing about Navalny, the Russian opposition figure who has been jailed and poisoned.\n\nIn April 2021, Conti members “mango” and “johnyboy77” discussed plans to access files belonging to a journalist for investigative outlet Bellingcat, which had published a joint investigation with CNN in December 2020 on the alleged role of the Russia’s FSB intelligence agency in the poisoning of Navalny.\n\n“Bro, don’t forget about Navalny, I flagged it to the boss – he’s waiting for details,” mango wrote to johnyboy77 in Russian.\n\nIt’s unclear who “the boss” is in this exchange. But Christo Grozev, Bellingcat’s lead Russian investigator, tweeted that the leaked chat corroborated an anonymous tip that Bellingcat received stating that a “‘global cyber crime group acting on an FSB order has hacked one of your contributors.’”\n\nConti operatives refer in their chats to Liteyny Avenue in St. Petersburg, which happens to be home to local FSB offices, according to Kimberly Goody, director of cyber crime analysis at security firm Mandiant.\n\n“Generally speaking, it would be relatively unsurprising to learn that an operation as extensive as this would not in some way be leveraged as an asset [by the Russian government] at a point in time,” Goody told CNN.\n\nA Ukrainian serviceman stands among debris after shelling in a residential area in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 18. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian government has long denied accusations that it turns a blind eye to cybercrime.\n\nThere also appears to be a correlation between the Conti leaks and public warnings from US cybersecurity officials, suggesting that federal authorities have been closely watching the group.\n\nOn October 26, 2020, as US hospitals continued to reel from coronavirus cases, a Conti member with the alias Troy wrote to another member in Russian: “F**k clinics in the USA this week … There will be panic. 428 hospitals.”\n\nTwo days later the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a dire warning about ransomware attacks on hospitals, many of which used a piece of malicious software that the leaked documents tie to Conti operatives. It was unclear what specific intelligence prompted the federal warning about the hospitals, but the timing was striking.\n\n‘It’s my work’\n\nCyberattacks have played a supporting role in the war in Ukraine. The White House has accused the Russian GRU military intelligence agency of knocking key Ukrainian government websites offline prior to the invasion. (A charge the Kremlin denies.) US officials are also investigating a hack of a satellite network serving parts of Ukraine, which occurred as the Russian invasion began, as a potential Russian state-sponsored hack, CNN previously reported.\n\nFor its part, the Ukrainian government has encouraged an “IT army” of volunteer hackers in Ukraine and abroad to conduct cyberattacks on Russian organizations.\n\nIn the free-for-all that is Ukrainian cyberspace, combatants like Danylo engage on their own terms.\n\nAn aerial view of the completely destroyed shopping mall after a Russian shelling in Kyiv, Ukraine on March 21, 2022. Emin Sansar/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nAsked how he’s been in recent days, Danylo’s replies have been consistent: “Still alive.”\n\nSeeing houses and schools turn to rubble has drained the vigor from his voice.\n\nDanylo recalled, in the early days of the war, going into a bunker during a bombing raid, with his laptop, and working on the Conti files. Another person in the bunker was mystified that he was focused on his computer amid the shelling.\n\n“What the f**k are you doing?” Danylo recalled the person asking him.\n\nDanylo laughed nervously as he told the story. “It’s my work,” he told CNN. “[I do it] because I can.”\n\nAfter weeks of living the war, Danylo told CNN he slipped safely out of Ukraine with his laptop this week.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2022/02/28/fact-check-whats-true-and-whats-false-invasion-ukraine/6952717001/", "title": "Fact check: What's true and what's false about the invasion of Ukraine", "text": "False and misleading information about the Russian invasion of Ukraine has spread rapidly on social media since Russian forces launched a military assault in the pre-dawn hours of Feb. 24.\n\nHere’s a roundup of claims related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict analyzed by the USA TODAY Fact Check team:\n\nFact check:Putin's claims justifying war in Ukraine are baseless, experts say\n\nU.S. and European relations with Russia, Ukraine\n\nClaim: There are U.S. biolabs in Ukraine funded by the U.S. government\n\nOur rating: False\n\nThe labs in question are owned and funded by the Ukrainian government.

Here's what you ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nWestern nations have said leaks in two Russian gas pipelines, Nord Stream 1 and 2, are likely the result of sabotage.\n\nOn Monday, leaks were discovered in the pipelines, prompting investigations by European authorities that determined powerful underwater explosions had occurred just before the pipelines burst in several places.\n\nThe pipelines were created to funnel gas from Russia into the European Union, and were controversial long before Russia waged war on Ukraine, largely because of fears around European reliance on Russian energy.\n\nBut the latest incidents are yet another twist in the energy standoff that erupted after Russia’s invasion, and which has only been deepening in the seven months since.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nWhat happened on the Nord Stream pipelines?\n\nSwedish authorities first sounded the alarm on Tuesday about leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 pipelines – both of which run under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark.\n\nThat came after seismologists detected underwater explosions near the pipelines on Monday; it’s unclear if those are connected to the leaks.\n\nNeither pipeline was transporting gas to Europe when the attacks occurred; Russia shut off gas flows through the first pipeline weeks ago, and the second was scrapped by Germany after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, just before it was due to become operational. But both still contained gas under pressure.\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said in a news conference Tuesday that the leaks were likely caused by “a deliberate action” but “not an attack against Sweden.” Other Western countries and NATO have echoed that conclusion.\n\nGerman, Danish and Scandinavian security authorities are now examining the leaks and trying to identify their cause, according to the German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who added that Europe is able to protect its own critical infrastructure.\n\nAuthorities are keeping ships away from the area, citing the risk of leaked gas igniting over the water and in the air – but say there are few other security risks, since the leak will only affect the environment where the gas plumes are located.\n\nWhat is Nord Stream?\n\nThe two Nord Stream pipelines designed to transport Russian gas to the EU were years in the planning.\n\nNord Stream 1 was announced in 1997, during a period of relatively calm relations between the West and post-Soviet Russia, and became operational in 2011. For the past decade, it has been a key artery carrying Russia’s vast gas supplies to Europe, accounting for about 35% of Europe’s total Russian gas imports last year.\n\nIt flows directly to Germany, the bloc’s biggest economy, which is particularly reliant on Moscow’s gas to power its homes and industry.\n\nNord Stream 2, the multimillion dollar, 750-mile sister project, was announced a few years later and completed last September. It was intended to deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year – more than 50% of Germany’s annual consumption – and could have been worth as much as $15 billion to Gazprom, the Russian state-owned company that controls the pipeline, based on its average export price in 2021.\n\nBut the project was shrouded in controversy from the beginning. The United States, the United Kingdom, Ukraine and several EU countries opposed it for years, warning it would increase Moscow’s influence in Europe.\n\nAnd following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year, Germany pulled the plug on the pipeline as it was on the cusp of becoming operational.\n\nWhy were the pipelines so controversial?\n\nEuropean reliance on Russian energy has long been a concern for many in the West. The construction of Nord Stream 2 divided politicians and analysts for years, and became beset by delays, previous US sanctions and opposition over its impact on the climate crisis.\n\nThe pipelines have given Russia significant leverage over Europe for some time. But until this year, European countries have been reluctant to wean themselves off Russian energy given the potential for rising prices.\n\nThe EU pledged to cut its dependence on Russian gas after Moscow annexed part of Ukraine in 2014, but imports increased between 2016 and 2018 before falling slightly.\n\nRussia’s invasion of the rest of Ukraine this year has completely changed the calculus – but Europe’s shift in approach has come too late to prevent what is expected to be a difficult winter this year, with soaring energy prices fueling inflation around the continent.\n\nThe pipelines raised concerns in Europe long before Russia invaded Ukraine. Lisi Niesner/Reuters\n\nWhat impact has the war had?\n\nThe worst fears of the project’s critics materialized within a matter of days in February, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then, the Nord Stream pipelines have become a geopolitical football and Europe and Moscow have been locked in a standoff over the supply of gas to the continent.\n\nFrom June, Gazprom slashed flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 20% of its capacity, initially citing maintenance issues and a dispute over a missing turbine caught up in Western export sanctions.\n\nIt also cut off supplies to several “unfriendly” European countries and energy companies over their refusal to pay for gas in rubles, as the Kremlin demanded, rather than the euros or dollars stated in contracts. European leaders have described the demands as blackmail.\n\nThen, earlier this month, Russia said it would cut off supplies through the pipeline indefinitely, worsening a shortage that threatens to tip the continent into an energy crisis this winter. Gazprom claimed at the time it had found an oil leak in a turbine.\n\nThe idea that Russia might restart supplying Europe next year has for some time now seemed a longshot. Following the recent damage, it appears almost impossible.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe damage to the Nord Stream pipelines may spell an ignominious end for the 25-year project, at least for the near future.\n\nBut the wrangle over Russian energy is certain to continue.\n\nEarlier this month the West’s biggest economies agreed to impose a price cap on Russian oil in a bid to limit Moscow’s ability to finance its war, while keeping a lid on global inflation. That could result in countries blocking insurance cover or financing for oil shipments.\n\nRussia had already threatened to retaliate by banning oil exports to countries that implement a price cap.\n\nAnd in the near-term, a cold winter could cause crisis in Europe, where energy prices have spiraled since Russia’s invasion. Goldman Sachs warned in September that a typical family in the EU could face energy bills of 500 euros ($480) each month by early next year without government intervention, up 200% from 2021.\n\nFor now, speculation is bound to continue about what caused the explosion, and any evidence pointing to a state actor would have major geopolitical consequences.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/12/politics/gru-russia-hackers-ukraine-power-grid/index.html", "title": "Russian military-linked hackers target Ukrainian power company ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Russian military-linked hacking group has attempted to infiltrate Ukrainian power substations and deploy malicious code capable of cutting electricity, Ukrainian government officials and private investigators said Tuesday.\n\nThe cyberattack appears to have been thwarted, and the Ukrainian government Computer Emergency Response Team said it had prevented the attackers from “carrying out [their] malicious intent.” Victor Zhora, a senior Ukrainian cybersecurity official, told CNN that the hack attempt did not affect the provision of electricity at the power company.\n\nUkrainian officials declined to name the electric utility targeted by the hackers. But Farid Safarov, a deputy minister at Ukraine’s energy ministry, told reporters that about 2 million people could have lost power had the cyberattack been successful.\n\nThe US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency was working closely with Ukrainian officials to understand the incident and share any relevant information to protect US infrastructure, CISA Director Jen Easterly tweeted Tuesday.\n\nThe hackers blamed for the incident – a group known as Sandworm that the US Justice Department has attributed to Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency – are of top concern to cybersecurity researchers around the world because they cut power in parts of Ukraine in 2015 and 2016.\n\nIn the recent incident, the hackers tried to deploy malicious code “against high-voltage electrical substations in Ukraine” on April 8, and appeared to make preparations for the attack two weeks prior, according to cybersecurity firm ESET, which investigated the hack.\n\nIt’s the type of advanced cyberattack that many US officials and cybersecurity analysts predicted would accompany Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“A lot of people were expecting something like this to happen, with critical infrastructure targeted by really advanced malware,” Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET’s director of threat research, told CNN.\n\nWhile this hack may have been thwarted, prior Sandworm hacks in Ukraine have been disruptive.\n\nA 2015 cyberattack that US officials pinned on Sandworm cut power for about a quarter million people in Ukraine. A follow-up hack in 2016 on an electrical substation outside of Kyiv caused a smaller blackout and the malicious code used was more sophisticated, according to analysts.\n\nThe hacking tool used in the recent attempted cyberattack on the Ukrainian power company was a variation of the malicious software known as Industroyer that was used in the 2016 hack, ESET researchers said.\n\n“It is something that we don’t see often. And the fact that Industroyer was used years ago … this is very significant,” Boutin said.\n\nUS officials have been closely monitoring suspected Russian cyberattacks against Ukrainian critical infrastructure before and after Russia’s invasion on February 24. The White House on February 18 blamed a separate hacking incident, which temporarily knocked Ukrainian government and bank websites offline, on the GRU.\n\nA spokesperson for the Biden administration’s National Security Council said the attempted hack of the Ukrainian electric utility this month “clearly demonstrates that disruptive and destructive cyber-attacks against Ukraine continue, and we applaud the work of Ukraine’s network defenders in responding to it.”\n\nThe incident also serves as a “reminder about the need for the US cybersecurity community to continue taking steps to counter potential cyber threats to US critical infrastructure,” the NSC spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional comment.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/politics/nord-stream-pipeline-leak-russian-navy-ships/index.html", "title": "First on CNN: European security officials observed Russian Navy ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEuropean security officials on Monday and Tuesday observed Russian Navy support ships in the vicinity of leaks in the Nord Stream pipelines likely caused by underwater explosions, according two Western intelligence officials and one other source familiar with the matter.\n\nIt’s unclear whether the ships had anything to do with those explosions, these sources and others said – but it’s one of the many factors that investigators will be looking into.\n\nRussian submarines were also observed not far from those areas last week, one of the intelligence officials said.\n\nThree US officials said that the US has no thorough explanation yet for what happened, days after the explosions appeared to cause three separate and simultaneous leaks in the two pipelines on Monday.\n\nRussian ships routinely operate in the area, according to one Danish military official, who emphasized that the presence of the ships doesn’t necessarily indicate that Russia caused the damage.\n\n“We see them every week,” this person said. “Russian activities in the Baltic Sea have increased in recent years. They’re quite often testing our awareness – both at sea and in the air.”\n\nBut the sightings still cast further suspicion on Russia, which has drawn the most attention from both European and US officials as the only actor in the region believed to have both the capability and motivation to deliberately damage the pipelines.\n\nUS officials declined to comment on the intelligence about the ships on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Denmark and Sweden are investigating, but a site inspection has yet to be done and details on exactly what caused the explosions remains sketchy. One European official said that there is a Danish government assessment underway and it could take up to two weeks for an investigation to properly begin because the pressure in the pipes makes it difficult to approach the site of the leaks — although another source familiar with the matter said the probe could begin as soon as Sunday.\n\nThe prime ministers for both Denmark and Sweden said publicly on Tuesday that the leaks were likely the result of deliberate actions, not accidents, and Sweden’s security service said in a statement Wednesday that it cannot be ruled out “that a foreign power is behind it.” US national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Tuesday evening also called the leaks “apparent sabotage” in a tweet.\n\nBut senior Western officials have so far stopped short of attributing the attack to Russia or any other nation.\n\nThe Kremlin has publicly denied striking the pipelines. A spokesman called the allegation “predictably stupid and absurd.”\n\nCNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for comment on the presence of the ships.\n\nInvestigation into the leaks\n\nThe Danish government is taking the lead on the investigation and has put in place an exclusion area of five nautical miles and a 1 kilometer no-fly-zone, according to European sources familiar with the matter.\n\nOther than Sullivan, US officials have been far more circumspect than their European counterparts in drawing conclusions about the leaks.\n\n“I think many of our partners have determined or believe it is sabotage. I’m not at the point where I can tell you one way or the other,” a senior military official said Wednesday. “The only thing I know there is that we think the water is between 80 and 100 meters [deep] at that location where the pipeline is. Other than that, I don’t know anything more.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Unprecedented' leaks in Russian gas pipelines spark concerns of sabotage 03:19 - Source: CNN\n\nBut one senior US official and a US military official both said Russia is still the leading suspect – assuming that the European assessment of deliberate sabotage is borne out – because there are no other plausible suspects with the ability and will to carry out the operation.\n\n“It’s hard to imagine any other actor in the region with the capabilities and interest to carry out such an operation,” the Danish military official said.\n\nRussia has requested a UN Security Council meeting on the damaged pipeline this week – something the senior US official said is also suspicious. Typically, the official said, Russia isn’t organized enough to move so quickly, suggesting that the maneuver was pre-planned.\n\nIf Russia did deliberately cause the explosions, it would be effectively sabotaging its own pipelines: Russian state company Gazprom is the majority shareholder in Nord Stream 1 and the sole owner of Nord Stream 2.\n\nBut officials familiar with the latest intelligence say that Moscow would likely view such a step as worth the price if it helped raise the costs of supporting Ukraine for Europe. US and western intelligence officials believe Russian President Vladimir Putin is gambling that as electricity costs rise and winter approaches, European publics could turn against the Western strategy of isolating Russia economically. Sabotaging the pipelines could “show what Russia is capable of,” one US official said.\n\nRussia has already taken steps to manipulate energy flows in ways that caused itself economic pain, but also hurt Europe. Russia slashed gas supplies to Europe via Nord Stream 1 before suspending flows altogether in August, blaming Western sanctions for causing technical difficulties. European politicians say that was a pretext to stop supplying gas.\n\n“They’ve already shown they’re perfectly happy to do that,” one of the sources said. “They weight their economic pain against Europe’s.”\n\nThe new Nord Stream 2 pipeline had yet to enter commercial operations. The plan to use it to supply gas was scrapped by Germany days before Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February.\n\nUS, European and Ukrainian officials have been warning for months, however, that critical infrastructure – not only in Ukraine but also in the US and Europe – could be targeted by Russia as part of its war on Ukraine.\n\nThe US warned several European allies over the summer, including Germany, that the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines could face threats and even be attacked, according to two people familiar with the intelligence and the warnings.\n\nThe warnings were based on US intelligence assessments, but they were vague, the people said – it was not clear from the warnings who might be responsible for any attacks on the pipelines or when they might occur.\n\nThe CIA declined to comment.\n\nDer Spiegel was the first to report on the intelligence warnings.", "authors": ["Katie Bo Lillis Natasha Bertrand Kylie Atwood", "Katie Bo Lillis", "Natasha Bertrand", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}]}

Parliament had to put a final stamp of approval at the joint session on Monday for it to officially go into effect, reported AP.\n\nThe amendment to Article 34 of the French Constitution states that “the law determines the conditions by which is exercised the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.” Abortion has been legal in France since 1975 and is overwhelmingly supported by the French population, according to polls.\n\nRecently, President Emmanuel Macron promised French citizens that he would work to make the right to abortion \"irreversible\" following the rollback of abortion rights in the U.S.\n\nFrance is the only country to currently have such a specification in their constitution, though former Yugoslavia enshrined the right into its constitution in 1974, a sentiment that carried over into modern-day Serbia in less specific terms as the right to \"decide on childbirth.” This amendment to the French constitution is one of only 17 made since the constitution was adopted in 1958 and the first since 2008.\n\nAccording to AP and The Guardian, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal told parliament that they \"have a moral debt to women\" in an appeal before the vote on Monday, saying in part, “We are haunted by the suffering and memory of so many women who were not free. We owe a moral debt [to all the women who] suffered in their flesh.\"\n\n“Today, the present must respond to history,\" he continued, reported AP and The Guardian. \"To enshrine this right in our constitution is to close the door on the tragedy of the past and its trail of suffering and pain. It will further prevent reactionaries from attacking women.\"\n\nThe right to abortion has not faced significant challenges by modern French parties, including conservatives and the far-right National Rally party. While some have voted against making abortion a constitutional right in the past, the attitudes of the major political parties generally align with that of the French public, of which a recent poll found more than 80% support the right to abortion, according to AP.\n\nReactions to the French abortion bill\n\nU.S. abortion restrictions:Wyoming legislature approves chemical and surgical abortion restrictions\n\nApplause and celebration broke out in parliament following the successful vote, with lawmakers caught on camera standing to clap in the chambers.\n\nPhotos and videos outside the palace also showed crowds stationed outside with signs, hugging each other, cheering, clapping and setting off celebratory glitter launchers as the final approval was announced. According to AP and The Guardian, cheers and celebration could be heard both in and outside the palace.\n\nAnti-abortion protestors also made an appearance outside the Palace of Versailles in response to the bill, likewise sporting signs. Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally, told outlets including Reuters the move was unnecessary and a ploy for political points, though she also said her party would not vote against it.\n\nOther anti-abortion organizations like the Association of Catholic Families criticized the move, calling it a \"defeat\" to women and children, according to Reuters.\n\nPharamcies to stock abortion meds:CVS and Walgreens to begin carrying abortion pill mifepristone within weeks\n\nWhat does 'enshrine' mean?\n\nThe word \"enshrine\" is often used when referring to amendments and constitutions, such as in the case of France enshrining the right to abortion in its constitution. Why say \"enshrine\" when you could simply say something like \"written into\" or \"included in?\" The connotation of the word is slightly heftier than simply \"to put in.\"\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster and the Cambridge Dictionary, to enshrine something is to containor preserve it in a place or way that is highly admired, protected and respected.\n\nIf a political or social right is \"enshrined in something\" it is protected by being included in that thing. For example, the right to vote for women is present in the United States Constitution in the form of the 19th Amendment, meaning women's right to the vote is protected, regarded and respected because it is enshrined in, or is part of, the constitution.\n\nIn this way, enshrine means more than to place something inside of something else. It carries the connotation of respect and importance.\n\nAbortion rights post overturning of Roe v. Wade\n\nFrench lawmakers cited the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade in the U.S. as part of the inspiration behind its most recent abortion bill, saying in part: \"Unfortunately, this event is not isolated: in many countries, even in Europe, there are currents of opinion that seek to hinder at any cost the freedom of women to terminate their pregnancy if they wish,” reported AP.\n\nFrench activists and politicians have expressed concerns over abortion rights since the Dobbs decision made by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022, stripping Americans of abortion rights after 50 years of constitutional protection.\n\nOther European countries are also weighing expanding access, including the few very small countries that do not currently allow or heavily restrict abortion, like Poland. Abortion is currently accessible in more than 40 European nations.\n\nIn the time following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision, dozens of states across the country have banned or attempted to ban abortion. Before the decision was overturned, people in almost every state were allowed to undergo an abortion until around 24 weeks into a pregnancy, which was typical practice determined by the Supreme Court in the 1992 decision Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nNow, abortion laws vary from state to state, with many high-profile cases of ongoing bills, legal battles, and deaths punctuating the battleground that has been reproductive rights.\n\nRecently, an Alabama law that determined frozen embryos to be \"extrauterine children\" raised alarms amongst IVF patients and providers; in December, the plight of an Ohio woman who suffered a miscarriage became national news when the state charged her with felony abuse of corpse.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/09/politics/abortion-rights-2022-midterms/index.html", "title": "Voters deliver ringing endorsement of abortion rights on midterm ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nVoters in key states on Tuesday made their support for abortion rights clear, affirming a months-long push by Democrats to act on a number of ballot measures in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nSeveral states moved to enshrine abortion protections in their constitutions and others rejected proposals to limit abortion access or criminalize doctors in some cases. Democratic lawmakers and organizers cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Republican efforts to limit women’s choices, and the notable electoral reaction could serve as a warning sign for future GOP efforts to restrict the procedure at the state-level.\n\nAbout 27% of voters cited abortion as the issue most important to them, according to the preliminary results of the national and state exit polls conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research. The results also showed that when it comes to the issue, roughly half of voters said they trusted Democratic candidates, compared with more than 4 in 10 voters who said they trusted Republican candidates.\n\n“This fall, Roe is on the ballot,” President Joe Biden declared in a defiant speech from the White House just hours after the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year.\n\nWhile CNN projected some anti-abortion Republicans will win their races, voters in five states moved to affirm abortion rights.\n\nHere’s a running list of what voters decided on Election Day.\n\nMontana rejects abortion measure that would allow criminal penalties on health care providers\n\nVoters in Montana rejected on Tuesday proposed legislation that would have imposed criminal penalties on health care providers who do not act to preserve the life of infants born during the course of an abortion, CNN projects.\n\nLR-131, if adopted, would have provided that an infant “born alive” – defined as an infant “at any stage of development” who breathes, has a beating heart or definite movement of voluntary muscles after expulsion or extraction – be treated as a legal person entitled to medical treatment.\n\nA health care provider who violated the proposed law would have been guilty of a felony and could have faced up to 20 years in state prison and/or a fine of up to $50,000. It would have also mandated that health care providers and clinics report “a failure to comply with the requirements” to law enforcement.\n\nMontana currently prohibits abortions past viability – “the ability of a fetus to live outside the mother’s womb” – except to save the life or health of the woman.\n\nLast year, the state’s Republican-led legislature passed the bill that put the referendum on the ballot.\n\nBackers of the measure said such a law was necessary to protect infants born during an abortion attempt, while opponents said the bill wasn’t needed because there are laws in place that require care to be given.\n\nHillary-Anne Crosby, the campaign coordinator and communications lead for Compassion for Montana Families, previously said LR-131 “zeroes in on families that are having complications in the labor and delivery room, such as lethal fetal abnormalities.”\n\n“It’s not uncommon for families to make the decision to induce labor so that they can hold their infant for a few minutes, maybe have family come in and be able to meet their new family member for the few moments that they are alive, and LR-131 throws a wrench in that being a viable option to them without the health care workers facing a felony,” she previously told CNN.\n\nKentucky rejects proposal that would have further restricted abortion rights\n\nKentucky voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to amend the state’s constitution to say that it does not “secure or protect a right” to abortion or the funding of abortion, CNN projects.\n\nThe ballot question voters faced read: “Are you in favor of amending the Constitution of Kentucky by creating a new Section of the Constitution to be numbered Section 26A to state as follows: To protect human life, nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to secure or protect a right to abortion or require the funding of abortion?”\n\nKentucky’s “trigger law,” which bans most abortions at all stages of pregnancy, and a law banning abortion after roughly six weeks of pregnancy have been allowed to be enforced temporarily while a lawsuit challenging the laws continues.\n\nKentucky Right to Life executive director Addia Wuchner, who chairs the Yes for Life Alliance, which supported Amendment 2, previously said voting “yes” would “ensure there’s no false interpretation of the constitution.”\n\nWithout the amendment, “instead of the lawmakers who duly reflect the people’s will, we would end up with the abortion industry taking each law back into court,” Wuchner said.\n\nTamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, had said passing the amendment would “open the door to more attacks on abortion access,” but rejecting it would allow abortion rights advocates to “continue to fight back” against the six-week ban and the trigger ban.\n\nIf adopted, the measure would have gone into effect immediately once the results of the election are certified by the State Board of Elections.\n\nMichigan enshrines abortion rights\n\nMichigan voters on Tuesday voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state’s constitution, a move that will help block a decades-old abortion ban from taking effect, CNN projects.\n\nThe passage of ballot Proposal 3 amends the Michigan constitution to establish an “individual right to reproductive freedom, including right to make and carry out all decisions about pregnancy.”\n\nMichigan has a 1931 law that essentially bans abortion in the state, but that law is being blocked by the courts. The passage of the ballot proposal helps prevent the ban from taking effect.\n\nThe amendment allows the state to regulate abortion after fetal viability, except if needed to protect a patient’s life or physical or mental health. It also bars the state from prosecuting an individual for having an abortion or miscarriage or from prosecuting someone who assists a pregnant person in “exercising rights established by this amendment.”\n\nThe proposal had to overcome legal challenges to be included on the ballot, with the Michigan Supreme Court ordering officials in September to include the question on ballots in a 5-2 ruling.\n\n“We are energized and motivated now more than ever to restore the protections that were lost under Roe,” Darci McConnell, a spokesperson for Reproductive Freedom for All, a group backing the effort, said in a statement after the ruling.\n\nMichigan Republicans had blasted the court’s decision, along with another on a voting rights ballot proposal. “Despite the court ruling, these measures remain too extreme for Michigan, and we are certain they will be handily defeated at the ballot box in November,” Elizabeth Giannone, deputy communications director for the state party, predicted in a statement earlier this year.\n\nCalifornia voters put abortion rights in state constitution\n\nThe California Constitution will protect the right to an abortion after residents on Tuesday passed a ballot initiative to enshrine the right in the state’s governing document, CNN projects.\n\nCurrently, the state constitution guarantees a right to privacy, which the California Supreme Court has ruled includes the right to have an abortion.\n\nIn May, following the leak of the US Supreme Court’s draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade, California Democratic leaders Gov. Gavin Newsom, state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said in a statement that they would propose an amendment “so that there is no doubt as to the right to abortion in this state.”\n\nThe Democratic-controlled state legislature in June approved putting the amendment on the November ballot.\n\n“Proposition 1 ensures that no matter what the future legislature looks like, what the future governor looks like, that people in California have a constitutional protection that explicitly ensures the state won’t interfere with their right to reproductive freedom,” Jodi Hicks, the head of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California and co-chair of the Yes on Prop 1 campaign, previously told CNN.\n\nThe California Family Council had said the proposed amendment is an “extreme and costly proposal that does nothing to advance women’s health.” And the California Catholic Conference, which opposes Proposition 1, called it a “misleading ballot measure that allows unlimited late-term abortions – for any reason, at any time, even moments before birth, paid for by tax dollars.”\n\nThe Yes on Prop 1 campaign previously said the proposal would not change “existing state constitutional protections and law, which provide for the right to choose an abortion prior to viability or to protect the pregnant person’s life or health.”\n\nThe measure goes into effect the fifth day after the vote is certified.\n\nVermont voters back abortion rights\n\nVoters in Vermont on Tuesday approved an amendment to the state’s constitution that abortion rights supporters say will protect “every person’s right to make their own reproductive decisions,” including about pregnancies, abortion and birth control, CNN projects.\n\nThe Vermont Constitution will now be amended to read: “That an individual’s right to personal reproductive autonomy is central to the liberty and dignity to determine one’s own life course and shall not be denied or infringed unless justified by a compelling State interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”\n\nAbortion is currently legal at all stages of pregnancy in Vermont. The proposed amendment was first brought by the Vermont Legislature in 2019.\n\nVermont for Reproductive Liberty Ballot Committee, the coalition that backed Article 22, had previously said state-level protections “are vital to safeguarding access” now that the US Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n“It would mean that abortion access has been codified in the state constitution, and really the most important part of that is that it’s protected long-term, and it means that access is going to be there, no matter what our politicians do,” Sam Donnelly, the campaign manager for the coalition, previously told CNN.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of Article 22 have said its adoption means that Vermont lawmakers will be unable to pass any limitations or regulations on abortion in the future because it would then be deemed unconstitutional.\n\nMary Beerworth, the executive director of the Vermont Right to Life Committee, which opposes the amendment, had said the proposal goes “way, way further” than codifying abortion rights into the state constitution.\n\n“It will be about a vast range of anything that pertains to your personal reproductive autonomy, from surrogacy, three-parent embryo, designer babies, minors possibly accessing the hormone blockers for transgender surgery without their parents’ knowledge or consent,” she previously told CNN. “It’s opening a whole new world here if it passes.”\n\nThis headline and story have been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Devan Cole Paul Leblanc", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Devan Cole", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/11/06/ohio-issue-1-abortion-amendment-impact-2024-election/71424112007/", "title": "Ohio abortion vote should be a wake up call to Republicans for 2024", "text": "Conservatives spent decades laser-focused on overturning Roe v. Wade as their best strategy to fight abortion access in the country and to protect lives.\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court did just that last year, however, the pro-life movement was clearly unprepared for what to do next.\n\nThat’s not the case with supporters of abortion rights. They were ready. When abortion rights were struck from the federal Constitution, activists turned to the next best thing: state constitutions.\n\nTheir next target? Ohio.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters in this swing state will decide on Issue 1 – whether to enshrine wide-ranging abortion rights into their state constitution. And it’s looking like they will say “yes” to approving the measure.\n\nIt’s not only the polls that indicate this is the direction voters will go – following the end of Roe, measures in six other states have firmly come down on the side of abortion rights.\n\nLast November, three states, including Ohio’s neighbor Michigan, became the first in the country to pass amendments that place sweeping abortion protections into their constitutions. In Michigan’s case, that means the state now has much more lenient provisions that it did under Roe.\n\nOhio is the only state this election with a similar measure on the ballot.\n\nWhat this Republican-controlled state decides this week has big implications for 2024, and that’s why it has caught the nation’s attention.\n\nOhio is a test case for winning strategy\n\nIssue 1 would cement abortion rights into the constitution. Abortions would be allowed at least through viability (about 24 weeks), but the fear of pro-life advocates is that it could go much further and allow for late-term abortions. It could also open the door to overturning existing restrictions on abortion, including parental consent for minors.\n\nThe measure is purposefully vague, and includes leeway for doctors to perform abortions to protect the “pregnant patient’s life or health.”\n\nOhio currently has a six-week abortion ban on the books, but it's on hold due to litigation.\n\nIssue 1 is wrong for Ohio:Abortion shouldn't be left up to women and doctors. We need government restrictions.\n\nProponents of the amendment are selling their cause as preserving reproductive decisions, including abortion. A similar strategy proved effective in Michigan – the proposal was billed as a way to keep Roe provisions in place, even though it went much further than that.\n\nAnd once these rights are embedded into a state constitution, changing them becomes very difficult, effectively ending any meaningful debate going forward.\n\nA poll from last month found Ohio’s Issue 1 had 58% support, including 39% of Republicans surveyed. And a USA TODAY Network/Suffolk University poll from July found a similar percentage of Ohioans favored the proposal.\n\nProponents of Issue 1 also got a boost in August, when voters soundly defeated a GOP-backed measure that would have made passing constitutional amendments – such as Issue 1 – more difficult.\n\nPro-life advocates aren’t giving up, however.\n\n“We are feeling very optimistic going into Tuesday,” says Amy Natoce, press secretary for Protect Women Ohio, which is advocating against the measure. “We are seeing a lot of enthusiasm on the ground here, especially with our canvassing efforts and our volunteer efforts.”\n\nShe says canvassers have gone door to door since early May. Other support has come from Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who won reelection by a huge margin last year. DeWine has described Issue 1 as “just not right for Ohio.”\n\nGeorge Soros, ACLU flood Ohio with money\n\nAny successful political campaign these days requires significant amounts of money, and the fight over abortion is no different.\n\nMoney is pouring into Ohio, and it looks like supporters of abortion rights are winning the financial race. Since early September, proponents have brought in about $30 million compared with opponents’ $10 million.\n\nSome of the biggest donations in support of passing the measure have come from outside the state. Millions have come from D.C.-based Sixteen Thirty Fund, New York-based Open Society Policy Center (linked to billionaire George Soros), the American Civil Liberties Union and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nHaley on the rise:Nikki Haley already beats Biden in polls. Now she needs to win the next Republican debate.\n\nShould these East Coast liberals be helping shape Ohio abortion policy? Voters in Ohio – who twice voted for Donald Trump – should be aware of who is influencing their decision.\n\nIf the effort proves successful, abortion activists are ready to expand this push into several other states. A handful of similar measures are expected in 2024, including in Florida and Arizona.\n\nTuesday’s results could also influence the conversation about abortion in next year’s presidential race. Republicans remain divided on messaging and next steps, and this issue could serve as an impediment for the GOP as it did in the midterm elections.\n\nConservatives weren’t ready for the state-level fight over abortion after Roe.

Yet he is in a fight to stave off Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky's attorney general.– Joey Garrison\n\nActivists eye Black voter turnout in Mississippi after repeal of Jim Crow-era law\n\nMississippi is holding its first gubernatorial election since the overturning of a Jim Crow-era measure in Mississippi’s 1890 state constitution that targeted the power of Black voters.\n\nThe measure required any individual running for state office to win the majority of the popular vote and a majority of the state’s 122 House districts to be elected. If no candidate was able to do both, then the Mississippi House decided on the election outcome.\n\nIn 2020, voters repealed the system, instead requiring candidates to receive only a majority of the popular vote to get elected in the state.\n\n\"Now that it's just a popular vote, then the influence of the Black vote means more,\" said Charles V.

After the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump’s campaign filed a lawsuit alleging Philadelphia officials violated state law while ballots were being tallied, which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed.\n\nWhoever is elected to the state's Supreme Court this year could be crucial, as fights could play out again in Pennsylvania in 2024.\n\nThe court has a 4-2 Democratic majority after the death of Justice Max Baer.

Officials aim to earn your trust in 2024\n\nWASHINGTON − Ahead of another election cycle that is already shaping up to be contentious, federal and state election officials are in the midst of campaigns of their own to reassure wary voters about the integrity of casting their ballots.\n\nThey are recruiting poll workers, certifying voting machines and hosting lessons on how election systems work in community centers, classrooms and libraries.\n\nThe steps are needed, experts say, to restore voters' confidence in a system that, despite some flaws and outspoken election deniers, was mostly trustworthy and secure in the first place.\n\nThose fraud claims, in part, gave rise to calls for major overhauls of election systems in some states led mostly by Republican lawmakers. Some, particularly voters of color, were already skeptical of a system with a history of discrimination that hasn't always been open to them. New laws to restrict access has fueled that mistrust, experts said.\n\nMuch of the work of assuring voters will fall to local elections officials, experts said. Americans have more trust in their local election systems, which they’re more familiar with, according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center.\n\n\"People know their local election officials. They know when they go to city or town hall that they trust the people that work there,'' said Rob Rock, Rhode Island's deputy secretary of state. \"It's really important to make sure that people understand the process.''\n\n–Deborah Barfield Berry and Terry Collins\n\nRead the story:Fearful of voter fraud?

Wade: They’re not backing down.\n\nFrom Minnesota to California to Florida, more than a dozen protests are planned Monday to denounce the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the nearly 50-year-old federal constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nThe fallout was swift: At least 10 states have effectively banned abortion since Friday’s ruling. And 26 states have laws indicating they could outlaw or set extreme limits on abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.\n\nActivists on both sides of the debate rallied in jubilation or devastation.\n\n“Old men, stop telling me what to do with my body,” read one protester’s sign in Washington, DC.\n\n“People’s bodies are more regulated than guns,” read another protester’s sign in Atlanta.\n\nOutside the Supreme Court, an elated Valentina Aaron held up a sign with an image of a fetus. “Forceps off my body,” the sign read.\n\n“It’s incredibly exciting,” Aaron said about the historic ruling. “If I was a baby in a womb, I would want someone to stand up for me.”\n\nBut nearby, abortion rights supporter Joseph Little held a sign saying, “Forced birth is enslavement.”\n\n“Making people give birth is enslavement,” Little told CNN. “When you tell people that they no longer have a voice in their own personal matters, that’s enslavement. It’s oppression. And the Bible clearly says that we need to correct oppression.”\n\nThe demonstrations for and against the ruling have been largely peaceful, but a few arrests have been reported.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police intervened Saturday when protesters tried to march onto the US 101 freeway. Officers pushed protesters and struck at least one person with batons, video from the scene shows.\n\n“Full House” actress Jodi Sweetin was pushed to the ground by an officer, video from the incident also shows. Sweetin got up and kept protesting, leading a chant of “No justice, no peace,” according to photojournalist and witness Michael Ade. Los Angeles police are aware of the video and the “force used will be evaluated against the LAPD’s policy and procedure,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nIn New York, at least 20 people were taken into custody with charges pending, police said.\n\nIn Greenville, South Carolina, at least six people were arrested at a rally Saturday, officials said. The rally included people protesting and supporting the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn Washington, DC, two people were arrested Saturday after they were accused of “throwing paint over the fence by the US Supreme Court,” US Capitol Police tweeted.\n\nIn Phoenix, about 1,200 people attended an abortion rights rally Saturday, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said. Four people were arrested late in the day after a fence around the House and Senate Plaza was torn down, the agency said.\n\nIn Lynchburg, Virginia, police are investigating the vandalism at a pregnancy center. The words, “If abortion ain’t safe you ain’t safe” were spray-painted near the entrance of the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center, photos from police show. Security camera footage shows “four masked individuals committing the acts,” police said in a news release.\n\nThe facility did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. On Friday, the center shared its support of the Supreme Court decision on Facebook, writing: “Rejoicing with an overwhelmed heart of gratitude for the life affirming decisions that were made today.”\n\nStates ban abortion as others move to protect access\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling allowed states to immediately begin setting their own abortion policy, leaving people across the country with varying levels of access.\n\nSome states now have outright bans on abortions, with varying exceptions or none at all. They include Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Wisconsin.\n\nStates with abortion bans that are expected to take effect in the coming days and weeks include Wyoming, Mississippi, Tennessee and Idaho.\n\nIn Arizona, abortion providers started canceling appointments immediately after Friday’s ruling. The state Senate Republican Caucus issued a memo demanding the state immediately enforce a pre-Roe law that bans most abortions unless the procedure is necessary to save the life of a mother.\n\nMeanwhile, some Democratic governors are trying to protect access to abortion.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers said he’d fight “with every power we have” after his Republican-controlled state legislature declined to repeal the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which is taking effect again following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Friday protecting non-California residents seeking reproductive health care in the state. It also protects anyone performing, assisting or receiving an abortion in the state from any potential civil action originating outside the state.\n\nGov. Tim Walz of Minnesota issued an executive order Saturday providing similar protections. “Our administration is doing everything we can to protect individuals’ right to make their own health care decisions,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nIn Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee promised to create a “sanctuary state” for reproductive choice for people across the country via an upcoming executive order. The order will direct state police not to comply with extradition efforts from other states seeking to penalize those who travel to Washington to get an abortion. Inslee did not specify when the executive order will be issued or when it will take effect.\n\nThe post-Roe legal battles have started\n\nShortly after Utah banned most abortions, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit claiming the newly enacted law violates civil liberties guaranteed in the state’s constitution – including the right to determine family composition and equal protection.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood said the law will have a disparate impact on women as opposed to men and violates the right to bodily integrity, involuntary servitude, as well as the right to privacy.\n\nThe suit names the governor and the attorney general among the defendants.\n\nA judge on Monday evening granted a restraining order for 14 days, blocking the ban and allowing abortion services to resume.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox’s office did not immediately respond to CNN’s request Saturday for comment on the lawsuit nor the restraining order. Attorney General Sean Reyes’ office told CNN it had no comment on the lawsuit.\n\nUnder the ban, performing an abortion in Utah would be a second-degree felony in almost all cases, according to the lawsuit. Utah’s law allows for abortion if the mother’s health is in danger, there are uniformly diagnosable health conditions detected in the fetus or when the mother’s pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\n\n“When the Act took effect, PPAU (Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Association of Utah) and its staff were forced to immediately stop performing abortions in Utah beyond those few that are permitted by the Act,” the lawsuit reads. “If relief is granted in this case, PPAU’s health centers would resume providing abortions that would not qualify for any of the Act’s exceptions.”\n\nAfter the restraining order was granted, the organization said the decision was a win but “only the first step in what will undoubtedly be a long and difficult fight. Planned Parenthood will always stand alongside our patients and providers – no matter what.”", "authors": ["Kelly Mccleary Holly Yan", "Kelly Mccleary", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/states-abortion-trigger-laws-roe-v-wade-supreme-court/index.html", "title": "Where abortion 'trigger laws' and other restrictions stand after the ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court’s majority decision overturning Roe v. Wade has led states to implement their own abortion policies. The ruling has already resulted in a patchwork system across the country – as was anticipated – in which access to the procedure is, for many people, determined largely by whether a state is controlled by Republicans or Democrats.\n\nSo-called trigger laws – bans designed to take effect with the overturning of Roe v. Wade – are enforceable in some states following the US Supreme Court’s ruling, while in others, the bans await official action.\n\nHere’s where abortion “trigger laws” and other restrictive laws stand in a number of states:\n\nGone into effect or will soon\n\nRestrictive abortion laws are in effect in at least four states after the court handed down its ruling: Arkansas, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the Republican-controlled state legislature declined on June 22 to repeal an 1849 state law banning abortion during a special session called by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers – allowing it to take effect again after the high court overturned Roe.\n\nAnd in Mississippi, the trigger law was certified on June 27 by Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch, according to a statement from her office. Mississippi law states that within 10 days of the state attorney general confirming Roe has been overturned, abortions are prohibited in the state. Limited exceptions are provided in cases of rape or when the procedure would preserve the pregnant person’s life. The state passed a separate 15-week abortion ban in 2018, which was the law at the center of the case the Supreme Court ruled on last month.\n\nAwaiting state action\n\nIn Wyoming, the state’s “trigger law” takes effect five days after the governor certifies the Supreme Court’s decision.\n\nIn North Dakota, a 2007 abortion ban takes effect 30 days after the law is certified by the state attorney general to the Legislative Council, a nonpartisan arm of the state’s legislature.\n\nIdaho, Tennessee and Texas have laws that take effect 30 days after the Supreme Court issues a judgment separate from the opinion issued last month. Attorneys general in Texas and Idaho say it could take an additional 30 days for the judgment to be issued and the laws to take effect.\n\nTexas also has a separate abortion ban dating back to 1925, which the state’s Republican attorney general has tried to enforce since the US Supreme Court decision.\n\nLegal fights underway\n\nIn more than a dozen states, legal fights are underway over abortion bans and limits on the procedure.\n\nOklahoma is one of the latest states to face new legal action challenging its abortion bans, with provider groups asking the state Supreme Court on July 1 to block a criminal abortion law enacted this year, as well as a pre-Roe abortion ban that’s more than a century old.\n\nIn Louisiana, a state district judge on June 27 temporarily blocked the state from “enforcing or implementing” an abortion ban that had gone into effect immediately following the Supreme Court’s ruling. The law was challenged by the Center for Reproductive Rights and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP on behalf of Hope Medical Group for Women and Medical Students for Choice, which argued that the ban is unconstitutionally vague.\n\nIn Utah, Third District Judge Andrew Stone on June 27 granted a request by Planned Parenthood of Utah to issue a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of the state’s trigger law. This allows abortions to continue for 14 days.\n\nIn Kentucky, a state court granted a request for a restraining order filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, its Kentucky chapter and Planned Parenthood Great Northwest to block two laws passed in 2019 that would stop abortion services in the state. The blocked laws include a complete abortion ban and a six-week ban.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued that the two state laws violate the rights to “privacy, bodily autonomy, and self-determination” in the Kentucky Constitution. A hearing for a temporary injunction to block the laws during litigation has been scheduled for July 6, according to the ACLU, which brought the case on behalf of abortion providers.\n\nIn Florida, a state circuit court judge ruled that a new law banning abortions at 15 weeks is unconstitutional.\n\nIn a verbal ruling June 30, Second Judicial Circuit Court Judge John Cooper said he would be issuing a temporary statewide injunction that will go into effect once he signs the written order in the challenge brought by some Florida abortion providers. A spokeswoman for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis told CNN the state intends to appeal the ruling.\n\nPauses on other restrictive abortion bans dissolved\n\nIn addition to the so-called trigger laws taking effect, a number of states have dissolved court orders blocking enforcement of restrictive abortion laws in the days since the high court’s ruling.\n\nIn Texas, the state Supreme Court on July 1 partially granted GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton’s request to stay a lower court’s order, which temporarily blocked the state’s nearly century-old abortion ban. The order allows for civil enforcement of the ban, court documents show.\n\nBut the Center for Reproductive Rights interpreted the stay to mean that the law cannot be enforced criminally. CNN reached out to Paxton to ask whether he agrees that criminal prosecutions remain stayed, but did not receive a response.\n\nEarlier, on June 28, a Texas state court issued a temporary restraining order against the pre-Roe law, which had allowed some Texas clinics to resume abortion procedures for up to around six weeks into pregnancy.\n\nA federal judge in Alabama granted an emergency motion on June 24 to end an injunction against Alabama’s “Human Life Protection Act” after the Supreme Court issued its opinion. The motion was filed by Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, who argued that the injunction the court had entered against enforcement of the act because it “contravenes clear Supreme Court precedent” was no longer in effect with the high court overturning Roe.\n\nOhio Attorney General David Yost announced on June 24 that the injunction blocking his state’s abortion ban was dissolved, saying in a tweet: “The Heartbeat Bill is now the law.”\n\nThe Ohio Supreme Court on Friday denied an emergency request by abortion providers in the state that the court put on hold the state’s prohibition on abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, typically around six weeks into the pregnancy.\n\nThe providers argued that the law – which was passed in 2019 but only allowed to take effect after the US Supreme Court ended federal protections for abortion rights – violates the Ohio Constitution. The denial means the state’s six-week abortion ban can continue to be enforced while the case plays out.\n\nA federal judge in South Carolina on June 27 lifted a hold the court had placed on the state’s ban on abortions after about six weeks, allowing South Carolina to enforce its so-called heartbeat law. Attorney General Alan Wilson announced shortly afterward that the law was now in effect.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Devan Cole Tierney Sneed", "Devan Cole", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/27/politics/americas-new-reality-abortion-political-divides/index.html", "title": "America's chaotic new reality over abortion takes shape | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter the celebration and grief comes the chaos of a nation split by bitter political divides that now determine where women can access abortion.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s landmark decision on Friday to overturn the near 50-year constitutional right for a woman to end a pregnancy is triggering aftershocks that have already begun to change the character of American life.\n\nThe realization is dawning that a daring conservative Supreme Court majority has, with its willingness to trample long-held precedent, introduced a destabilizing dynamic that may go far beyond abortion in a nation already internally estranged by ideology.\n\nMore practically, and suddenly, abortion services have already ended in some conservative states. In some places on Friday, women in clinics were told as soon as the Supreme Court decision came down that their chance of an abortion in the state was gone.\n\n• Wisconsin has reverted to a 19th century law banning abortion.\n\n• South Dakota’s last abortion clinic is preparing to move to Minnesota.\n\n• Other red states are expected to act within days.\n\nMore liberal states like California are vowing to serve as havens for women, setting up inter-state clashes that will further balkanize America.\n\nFear is growing among progressives over what the court will do next. At nationwide Pride parades this weekend, the aching question was whether the hard-won right to same-sex marriage, enshrined by the court just seven years ago, is now at risk from activist justices. Uncertainty is growing about how the ruling will affect fertility treatments and even contraception. And businesses are hurriedly working out plans to compensate employees or extend health insurance to cover out-of-state abortion services but also worrying about alienating leaders in red states spoiling for a fight.\n\nAbortion is a deeply personal issue for people of all political beliefs. Many conservatives view the procedure as the murder of an unborn child. Many other Americans view the Supreme Court’s move as a callous infringement on human rights, namely a woman’s ability to make choices about her own body. Public opinion is often more nuanced than the black-and-white certainties of the political debate, especially over at what point of a pregnancy abortion should be allowed and what exceptions should be made for rape, incest or the health of the mother, but the reality remains that a clear majority of the country did not want to see the court overturn Roe.\n\nThe core rationale of the court’s conservative majority on Friday was that by returning the issue to the states, it would enable a democratic resolution of a contentious national issue. The last three days suggest that position was either naïve or willfully self-deceiving.\n\nRepublican leaders are already grappling, and in many cases, failing, to come up with answers about how and if they will help new mothers, whom they will force to bear children they may not want, even in some cases after rape and incest.\n\nAcross at least half of the United States, the Supreme Court’s ruling promised new hardship for poor and minority Americans who in many cases cannot afford to travel to have an abortion or are already hurt by insufficient social services.\n\nLeading Democrats responded with strong words and vows to fight back but have yet to mount an effective response, either politically ahead of 2022 or practically on the ground, where millions of women are suddenly left without their rights.\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said the court has “set a torch” to its legitimacy. And New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who accused conservative justices of lying in their Senate confirmation hearings about how they would rule on abortion, said impeachment should be on the table.\n\nBut as President Joe Biden left Saturday for the G7 summit of industrialized nations in Germany, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said he was sticking by his opposition to expanding the court and to eliminating the Senate filibuster. While the latter move would be needed to codify the right to abortion – it’s unlikely all Democrats in the Senate would go along with abolishing the 60-vote threshold. This new evidence of the gap between Biden and progressives may fuel fresh speculation about his standing in his party as he prepares to run for reelection.\n\nRepublicans celebrate – but face new scrutiny\n\nBut after a stunning conservative victory that electrified the GOP base, Republicans hoping to widen their national appeal must also consider how to position themselves in ways that won’t alienate moderate and some women voters amid complex and nuanced attitudes toward abortion.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was basking in the credit that he is due for installing a radical conservative majority on the Supreme Court. As a rally crowd in Illinois chanted “Thank you Trump” on Saturday night, the ex-commander-in-chief proclaimed a “victory for life.” Privately though, Trump was worried about the impact of the upheaval on his 2024 White House hopes and Republicans, The New York Times reported.\n\nWhatever the merits of the court’s hotly debated recent decisions on guns and religion’s place in society, its overturning of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision revealed a stark reality about the newly authoritarian GOP. The party’s most prominent figure – Trump – sought to deny voters their most fundamental right to choose their leader with his lies and coup attempt after the 2020 election. Then the Supreme Court majority that he built – alongside Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s questionable confirmation maneuverings – removed a constitutional right from Americans for the first time in history, flagrantly disregarding majority opinion. This confluence of radicalism will have huge implications for US democracy in the years to come.\n\nFor decades, the battle to end abortion has been a central rallying issue of GOP politics. But now it’s suddenly also become a governing challenge.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, for instance, on Sunday dodged questions on CBS’s “Face the Nation” over whether she would offer paid leave to expectant mothers deprived of abortions, expand health care and how the state would enforce her opposition to the use of abortion pills mailed from other states.\n\n“We will make sure that mothers have the resources, protection and medical care that they need. And we’re being aggressive on that,” she said before pivoting to an unrelated attack on Biden in an interview long on platitudes but short on specifics.\n\nDemocrats search for a response\n\nThe Democratic response to Friday’s Supreme Court decision has so far been a mix of disbelief, anger and promises to not give up the fight, but so far, no clear strategy.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll conducted Friday and Saturday found that 59% of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court’s decision. That ought to give Democrats a solid foundation to turn the midterm elections and the 2024 presidential race into a referendum on the Supreme Court. But high inflation and record gasoline prices threaten to doom the party’s majorities in Congress regardless.\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union,” Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams pointed to a Georgia law due to come into force within days that bans abortion at six weeks, as she sought to weaponize the issue against her Republican opponent and the current governor in one of the marquee midterm races.\n\n“I would tell anyone, whether you’re a business or a citizen thinking about being in Georgia, to take into very real consideration the danger that Brian Kemp poses to the life and welfare of women in this state,” Abrams told Jake Tapper.\n\nSpeaking on ABC News’ “This Week,” Warren said the court had undermined its own legitimacy.\n\n“They just took the last of it and set a torch to it with the Roe v. Wade opinion,” the Massachusetts Democrat said, calling for more justices to be added to the court.\n\nA court does not lose legitimacy simply because it delivers opinions particular politicians may not agree with. And conservative scholars would argue that the majority’s recent rulings are justified by constitutional arguments. But the controversial construction of the right-wing majority – after McConnell paved the way for Friday’s ruling by blocking ex-President Barack Obama’s nominee in an election year and rushing Trump’s final nominee onto the court in the same circumstances – has no doubt tarnished its image. As has the fact that several senators now say they were misled by Trump nominees about how they would adjudicate abortion cases.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York suggested that Trump Supreme Court picks should be impeached for “lying under oath” about their positions on abortion. But even if the Democratic-led House pursued such a long-shot strategy, it’s inconceivable there would be a two-thirds majority to convict in the closely divided Senate.\n\nBut a new week could bring new decisions that underline the radicalism of the Supreme Court majority. Already, it used its opinion in the abortion case to almost mock critics who warn it should consider the impact of its literal reading of the Constitution, written in the 18th century, on 21st century society.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/03/politics/who-is-justice-samuel-alito/index.html", "title": "Alito's long legal career has featured criticism of Roe and abortion ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJustice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion ending a federal right to abortion is the culmination of a legal career in which he has cast doubt on the grounds on which Roe v. Wade was decided.\n\nIn his opinion – which mirrored the leaked draft published by Politico in May – Alito writes that Roe “must be overruled” and was “egregiously wrong from the start.”\n\nBorn in Trenton, New Jersey, Alito was nominated by former President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O’Connor and ascended to the high court in 2006. He clerked for Leonard I. Garth, judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1976-1977 before becoming assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1981, he became assistant to the solicitor general for the Department of Justice.\n\nDuring his time at the Justice Department, he outlined in a 1985 memo how the Reagan administration could approach its stance on limiting abortion, writing, “we should make clear that we disagree with Roe v. Wade and would welcome the opportunity to brief the issue of-whether, and if so to what extent, that decision should be overruled.”\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation hearings in 2006, Alito was asked about Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1991 case during his time as a judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Newark, New Jersey. The case struck down a Pennsylvania law that required women seeking abortions to notify their husband and in which he was the only dissenter. The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court.\n\nHe was also asked about a letter in his 1985 application to be deputy assistant to the US attorney general.\n\n“I am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion,” Alito wrote at the time.\n\nAlito defended his comments in the application, saying during the 2006 hearing, “that was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role” and that he would keep an open mind if the issue came before him on the Supreme Court.\n\n“And as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues,” he said.\n\nOne year after his appointment, the court reversed course on an abortion controversy, upholding by a 5-4 vote a federal ban on a late-term procedure that critics called “partial birth.” In an earlier case, while O’Connor was still on the bench, the justices had struck down a similar state ban as interfering with a woman’s right to end a pregnancy. (Some medical experts have said the procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, was the safest for women in certain circumstances.)\n\nCentral role in notable rulings\n\nDuring his tenure on the court, Alito has drafted some of the court’s most controversial opinions, including the 2007 Lilly Ledbetter pay-discrimination case, and sided with the majority on landmark decisions.\n\nHe also sided with the 5-4 majority in a ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which removed long-established legal limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions. The decision prompted sharp criticism from then-President Barack Obama during the State of the Union address in which Alito mouthed the words “not true,” a rare show of emotion from a Supreme Court justice who generally remains stoic during the addresses.\n\nAnd in 2014, Alito crafted the court’s 5-4 opinion to allow a Hobby Lobby craft chain and other Christian-run for-profit corporations to escape an Obama administration rule that their insurance cover contraceptives. The regulation arose from the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nAlito wrote that the court’s conservative majority rejected the argument by the Department of Health and Human Services that “the owners of the companies forfeited all (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships.”\n\n“The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs,” Alito wrote.\n\nThis story has been updated following the publication of the opinion striking down Roe v.

Wade overturned ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned, according to polling taken before the Supreme Court ruled Friday that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nHere’s a recap of the latest data on the public’s views of abortion and how Americans will be feeling about the decision, from CNN and elsewhere:\n\nViews on overturning Roe vs. Wade\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the Supreme Court’s draft opinion on the case, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn the landmark 1973 decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nJust 17% of Americans in the CNN poll said they’d be happy to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, with 12% saying they’d be satisfied, 21% that they’d be dissatisfied, 36% that they’d be angry, and 14% that they wouldn’t care. Most Democrats (59%) and nearly half of adults younger than 35 (48%) said they’d be angry. And a 59% majority of Americans said they’d support Congress passing a law to establish a nationwide right to abortion, with just 41% opposed.\n\nIn a May CBS/YouGov poll, 63% of Americans said they expected that overturning Roe would make abortion access harder for poor women, with 58% saying it would make abortion access more difficult for women of color. Fewer expected similar difficulties for White women (35%) or wealthy women (19%). And a majority of women (54%) said that, generally, overturning Roe would make life worse for most American women.\n\nViews on state abortion laws\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturning of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they lived.\n\nPolitical implications\n\nIt’s still too soon to know how views on abortion might shift in the wake of the court’s decision, or to forecast how the aftermath of the decision might affect the upcoming election. In a survey taken in May, Gallup found little change in the longstanding majority opposition to overturning Roe. However, its polling also found a shift on several other metrics. For the first time in Gallup surveys since 2001, a slim majority (52%) said they considered abortion to be morally acceptable. A similar 53% majority also said that abortion should be legal under most or all circumstances, up from 45% just a year ago – a shift that was particularly pronounced among Democrats and younger Americans.\n\nThere are some early signs that the blow to abortion access could be particularly motivational to abortion rights supporters. A significant share of core Democratic backers such as young people and women said they would be angry in the wake of the ruling, and several surveys this spring found Democratic voters more likely than Republican voters to see abortion as a highly relevant issue to this year’s election. But it’s less clear how that motivation might manifest itself, or to what extent it will alter the overall political landscape.\n\nA May poll from Monmouth University found that 48% of Democrats considered a candidate’s alignment with their views on abortion to be extremely important to their vote, up from 31% in 2018; among Republicans, the number was 29%, down from 36% four years ago.\n\nCNN polling conducted immediately before and after the leak of the draft Supreme Court opinion on Roe v. Wade found a 7-point rise in the share of Americans who said their views on abortion aligned more with Democrats than Republicans. But there was little immediate evidence of a sea change in any of the Republicans’ early advantages heading into the midterms. Only about half (49%) of Americans said they’d heard even a good amount about the draft decision at that time, with 51% saying they’d heard just some news or nothing at all.\n\nViews of the Supreme Court\n\nThe decision could also affect Americans’ views of the Supreme Court. Following the leak of the draft opinion, Marquette Law School polling found, public approval of the court fell, from 54% in March to 44% in May. The change was largely due to a shift among Democrats: While 49% of Democrats approved of the Supreme Court in March, just 26% felt the same in May. Marquette’s May poll also found that 23% of Americans viewed the Supreme Court as “very conservative,” an uptick from 15% in March.", "authors": ["Ariel Edwards-Levy"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/28/europe/poland-abortion-law-izabela-sajbor-death-intl-cmd/index.html", "title": "Poland has some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe. Izabela ...", "text": "Warsaw, Poland CNN —\n\nIzabela Sajbor knew for weeks that the baby she was carrying was unlikely to live long. On September 22 last year, she realized both their fates were sealed.\n\n“I hope I won’t get sepsis because then I won’t leave this place,” the 30-year-old wrote in a series of distraught text messages to her mother, just 12 hours before she died.\n\nIzabela had been admitted to the hospital after going into premature labor when she was 22 weeks pregnant.\n\nJust a few weeks before, she had been told that her unborn baby had Edwards’ Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. Most diagnosed with the condition will die before they are born; her doctor told her to prepare for that outcome.\n\nIzabela was heartbroken, her sister-in-law Barbara Skrobol told CNN. She had very much wanted the baby, a sibling for her 9-year-old daughter.\n\nBut after the fetal abnormality diagnosis, Izabela asked for an abortion on medical grounds.\n\n“They went to the doctors in Poland and asked if they could terminate the pregnancy, said Skrobol. “They said ‘no.” Then as she was looking to travel abroad, her waters broke.\n\nFrom her hospital bed in Pszczyna, southern Poland, Izabela explained to her mother that the doctors were waiting for the fetus’ heart to stop beating before they could operate on her via cesarean section in an attempt to avoid sepsis – a life threatening illness caused by the body’s response to an infection.\n\n“My life is in danger,” she said in one text message.\n\n“The doctors can’t help as long as the fetus is alive thanks to the anti-abortion law,” she wrote. “A woman is like an incubator.”\n\nWhen a scan showed that the fetus had died, Izabela was taken to the operating room. But on her way there, Izabela went into cardiac arrest, and died, according to her family’s lawyer.\n\nBut no official cause of death has been released. And, it’s unclear why Izabela’s doctors did not perform an abortion.\n\nHer family says Izabela is the first victim of the latest tightening of Poland’s abortion laws, already among the most restrictive in Europe.\n\nIzabela Sajbor, who died last September. Barbara Skrobol\n\nFor nearly three decades, abortion in the predominately Catholic country had only been allowed under three circumstances: If the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest, if the mother’s life was at risk, or in the case of fetal abnormalities.\n\nBut when the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party came into power in 2015, they pledged to tighten the law even further, saying they would remove the fetal abnormality exception, the most frequently used case for legal abortion, which accounted for 98% of all known legal abortions carried out in Poland in 2019, according to data from the Polish Ministry of Health.\n\nParliamentary opposition prevented the party from amending the law. But in October 2020, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal – the country’s highest court – ruled it was unconstitutional for women to terminate pregnancies in the case of fetal abnormalities, saying that that the exception constituted “eugenic practices.”\n\nWithin a year of that ruling, Izabela was dead.\n\nA preliminary criminal investigation has since been opened by the regional prosecutor’s office in Katowice.\n\nPoland’s President, Andrzej Duda, weighed in on Izabela’s case during a press conference last year, asking why an abortion was not performed, and why her life was not saved.\n\n“The doctors in the hospital did not perform the abortion, so you have to answer why it happened and why the woman’s life was not saved,” Duda said.\n\nPszczyna County Hospital denies any malpractice took place. It would not discuss any further details about the case with CNN.\n\nIn a statement on its website, posted in November, the hospital wrote that the doctors involved in the case have been suspended while the investigation continues.\n\nThe hospital said: “Doctors and midwives did everything in their power and fought a harrowing fight for the Patient and her Child.”\n\nBarbara Skrobol, Izabela's sister-in-law, sits beside her grave in southern Poland. Saskya Vandoorne\n\nThe hospital said it shared the pain of all those affected by Izabela’s death, especially her family.\n\n“It should … be emphasized that … all medical decisions were made taking into account the legal provisions and standards of conduct in force in Poland,” the hospital said.\n\nThe Polish government defended the law in a statement to CNN saying, “The termination of pregnancy remains legal where a woman’s life is at risk.”\n\n‘It is really hard to be a woman in Poland’\n\nPoland and Malta are the only European Union member states that maintain highly restrictive abortion laws.\n\nNikodem Bernaciak, a legal analyst at the Ordo Iuris Institute for Legal Culture, a conservative anti-abortion pressure group, told CNN the law is about upholding the constitution.\n\n“A constitutional court decided that every human life means also pre-born life,” Bernaciak said.\n\nBut reproductive rights activists say Poland’s increasingly stringent abortion laws have put women like Izabela in danger.\n\nActivist and doula Justyna Wydrzynska, from the abortion rights network, Aborcyjny Dream Team (ADT) is facing three years in jail for sending abortion pills to a pregnant woman who said she was being subjected to domestic violence. Wydrzynska admits to assisting the woman but has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go on trial in July.\n\n“This is how the patriarchy works here, taking away reproductive rights,” Wydrzynska told CNN. “It is really hard to be a woman in Poland.”\n\nIt’s legal in Poland to self-administer abortion pills, but not to assist others.\n\nWydrzynska said women in Poland were under unprecedented attack. Women contemplating abortion now shy away from seeking advice from doctors, she said, explaining that they are coming to activists like her for help instead.\n\n“It is frightening that the responsibility for those people lies with us,” she said. “They don’t have the psychological support.”\n\nSome of the hardest calls she has had to field are from women like Izabela who have had tests showing fetal abnormalities, and who know that they must continue to carry a fetus they know will not survive birth.\n\n“It is sometimes hard for us to listen to this,” she said. “They have to leave the country as a kind of criminal, and they have to search for help in other places.”\n\nLast year ADT and Abortions Without Borders helped 1,540 women in Poland travel abroad for abortions, according to Wydrzynska.\n\nDr. Magdalena Dutsch, from the Warsaw Women’s Institute for Health, said the law is penalizing Poland’s poorest, noting the financial burden for women who opt to travel outside the country for abortions.\n\n“This is huge inequality because not everyone has money to go to Slovakia to get an abortion and as a doctor, I’m supposed to help everyone equally – so that just hurts even more,” she said.\n\nEven inside Poland, Dutsch says the law amounts to a “location lottery” for women whose pregnancies might put their lives at risk.\n\n“If you live in Warsaw and you can come to this hospital where we are open and we talk about it … we have maybe a bit different interpretation of the law and we are not afraid,” she said.\n\nBut the law has already had a chilling effect, she said.\n\nActivists say women are often reluctant to ask for help and some doctors worry about the consequences of performing an abortion if they are perceived as being too quick to offer an abortion, even in situations where the mother’s life is in danger – like in Izabela’s case.\n\nDutsch told CNN she can’t make sense of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade. To her, the decision to have an abortion is a fundamental right.\n\n“It shocks me that this freedom of choice is taken away from women,” she says – even in the United States, which she had thought of as the land of “freedom.”\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Saskya Vandoorne Melissa Bell", "Saskya Vandoorne", "Melissa Bell"], "publish_date": "2022/06/28"}]}

These tips can help you ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Greener newsletter. Our seven-part guide helps you minimize your personal role in the climate crisis — and reduce your eco-anxiety.\n\nCNN —\n\nOur four-legged friends don’t drive gas-guzzling SUVs or use energy-sucking appliances, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have a climate impact. In fact, researchers have showed that pets play a significant role in the climate crisis.\n\nBut what do Barkley and Whiskers have to do with our warming planet? It’s the products we buy for them that need a closer look.\n\nTheir meat-heavy diet is the biggest contributor to their carbon pawprints, which requires an abundance of energy, land and water to produce. And the production of pet food emits huge amounts of planet-warming gases.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study, feeding dogs and cats creates the equivalent of around 64 million tons of carbon dioxide in the US each year. That’s roughly the same impact as 13.6 million cars on the road. And, if our furry friends formed a separate country, it would rank 5th in global meat consumption behind China, the US, Brazil and Russia, according to UCLA professor and author of that study Gregory Okin.\n\nBut don’t panic. Bidding farewell to your best friends is not the answer.\n\nIn addition to all the joy they bring, pets have a measurable positive impact on our physical health and mental wellbeing. Having a pet in the family is associated with lower stress, fewer heart attacks, lower rates of depression and increased self-esteem.\n\n“Our work does not mean we are ‘against’ keeping pets,” said Pim Martens, a professor of Sustainable Development at Maastricht University and someone who has researched the impact of pets on the planet. “There are lots of benefits as well. Just be aware of the ‘side-effects.’”\n\nSo, what’s a concerned pet parent to do? Here are some ways to minimize your pets’ environmental impact while still caring for your furry fleet.\n\nDo an assessment of your pet’s diet\n\nFirst, and most importantly — responsible owners considering making significant changes to their pet’s diet should discuss it with their veterinarian to make sure it’s right for their animal’s needs.\n\nIn fact, if you’re the proud owner of a feline, you shouldn’t even think about switching their diet. Cats are obligate carnivores — they must eat meat, according to Angela Frimberger, a veterinarian with Vets for Climate Action.\n\nDogs, on the other hand, are omnivores and don’t necessarily need to have meat every meal — let alone sirloin steak.\n\n“I wholeheartedly want pets to be fed a good quality, nutritionally appropriate diet for them,” Frimberger said. “But for most healthy pets, the trend to feed premium quality ingredient food goes back to our habit of viewing our pets’ needs through the lens of what we would like, rather than what they actually need or like. We should remind ourselves that what is appealing to us doesn’t necessarily equate to actual nutritional quality for the pet.”\n\nFrimberger noted there are some new food developments on the market that are worth looking into, especially for dogs, including lab-grown meat. A 2014 study found insects are a good and nutritious source of protein for pets — and not likely to gross your companion out (unlike humans who would find eating such critters revolting).\n\n“Insect-based pet foods can be nutritionally complete and are starting to come onto the market around the world,” Frimberger said. “They can also be a solution for some pets that have food allergies to traditional protein sources.”\n\nAnd of course, only feed the amount of food that your pet needs — they’ll be healthier and feel better too if they’re not overweight.\n\nCut out waste\n\nBuy pet toys with your pet's genuine welfare in mind. Resist the urge to shop for shopping's sake. natavilman/Adobe Stock\n\nWhile items like toys, bowls, litter, poop bags and leashes are often necessary for your pet, looking at their durability, supply chains and whether they can be recycled is equally as important as the product itself.\n\nFor cats, seek the most environmentally friendly litter option that your feline will accept, such as ones made from organic materials, rather than clay. Although clays are naturally occurring soil minerals, they must be mined, which contributes to soil erosion, habitat destruction and groundwater contamination.\n\nFor dogs, choose biodegradable poop bags and always pick it up, no matter where you are. Research shows that not scooping pup poop could cause harmful micro-organisms such as roundworm, E. coli and giardia to survive in your yard for up to four years, which is a health risk for humans.\n\nOkin recommends flushing pet poop straight down the toilet.\n\n“Our water system is designed to handle toxic waste and to keep those pollutants out of the environment,” Okin said. Just be sure you’re not flushing other things down there, too — like pet poop bags or non-flushable kitty litter. Feces only.\n\nAnd while it may be tempting to dress up your little ones for outings and various holidays, it’s important to buy items with the pet’s genuine welfare in mind. In other words, ask yourself: What does your pet really need, and what are you buying just to satisfy the urge to shop?\n\n“We need to think about the real needs of the pet rather than our drive for consumerism,” Frimberger said.\n\nAdopt responsibly\n\nSmaller pets -- including things like mice, birds and turtles -- have a smaller climate impact. Johan Ordonez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe general rule is that larger pets will have a larger climate impact than smaller ones, primarily because they need more food. So you might consider smaller breeds or species if you’re aiming to minimize your impact on the planet. A Chihuahua’s carbon pawprint will be much smaller than a Saint Bernard, for example.\n\nYou might also consider how some animal breeds tend to come with more health issues.\n\n“Avoiding animals with known health problems will reduce the need for veterinary intervention, which has a carbon footprint, and most importantly will reduce unnecessary suffering in terms of poor health and welfare,” Gudrun Ravetz with Vet Sustain said.\n\nAnd for those not into all the fluff, cuddling and slobber — you’re in luck.\n\n“Small rodents and birds are great options,” Okin said. “Snakes, turtles and reptiles can have a really low impact, too, for those that are into it.”", "authors": ["Kimberly Richardson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/environment/961022/the-rising-number-of-epidemics-under-the-sea", "title": "What's causing the rising number of epidemics under the sea? | The ...", "text": "A mysterious disease is spreading among marine mammals, leading experts to worry about the future of creatures living underwater.\n\nMass mortality of aquatic life is presenting a conundrum for scientists, who are now in a race against time to discover what is killing off swathes of pelagic animals.\n\nHow did the deaths start?\n\nIt is a “deadly epidemic” in the Red Sea that has sparked cause for concern, said Reuters, as an unknown illness has “killed off an entire species of sea urchin in the Gulf of Aqaba”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

In fact, between 1955 and 2018, a “sixth of marine mammal species have suffered a mass die-off caused by an infectious disease”, wrote Bradley van Paridon for Hakai Magazine in 2020. Van Paridon warned the Covid-19 pandemic reminds us of the “devastation disease outbreaks can cause”, but stressed these “do not only affect humans”.\n\nAs for the reason behind mass mortality rates below the surface of the water, “no one is sure”, The Washington Post added. However, in the Pacific Coast, a similar problem has been faced, “causing starfish to literally melt into goo”.\n\nThe newspaper suggested the disease is so prolific and ravaging that it can cause death among creatures “within hours of showing symptoms”. Reuters added that while some sea urchins wash up dead, others are “eaten by fish, likely speeding up contagion”.\n\nWhat do scientists think is happening?\n\nThe Guardian cited findings which suggested “matter in melting ice” could be behind the disease, because rising temperatures due to climate change make it “more likely that viruses and bacteria locked up in glaciers and permafrost could reawaken and infect local wildlife”.\n\nThe newspaper warned of the risk of “viral spillover – where a virus infects a new host for the first time”, and its potential frequency “close to melting glaciers”.\n\nAP News said that for now, “localised poisoning or pollution” has been ruled out as a cause of the disease, but scientists are now focusing their attention on “a single-celled parasite” which has “laid waste” to underwater ecosystems. Focusing on a similar issue discovered in the Caribbean, New Scientist says the culprit here is a microorganism with “tiny hair-like structures over its body”.\n\nWhat can be done to stop the epidemic from spreading?\n\n“Nothing…at the moment”, lead researcher Omri Bronstein, told Reuters. “We need sea urchins. Without this species, as we’ve seen – this is not imagination, we’ve seen it happening in front of our eyes – it is not a good future.”\n\nIn the meantime, researchers and politicians are looking for ways to protect the human population from the spread of disease, learning lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic, and observing the phenomena occurring underwater.\n\nGeorge Freeman, the science minister, told The Telegraph the government is considering installing “advanced sensors” in shipping ports, in the hopes of detecting and tracking the spread of infectious disease.\n\nIdentifying pathogens, said the newspaper, would “allow governments to take immediate action against emerging diseases of concern before they escalate into major outbreaks”, but the strategy remains in its infancy, Freeman added.", "authors": ["Rebekah Evans", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Harriet Marsden", "Devika Rao", "Austin Chen", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961702/residents-told-to-stay-indoors-after-lion-seen-on-outskirts-of-berlin", "title": "Residents told to stay indoors after lion seen on outskirts of Berlin ...", "text": "German authorities have warned locals in Berlin’s southern suburbs to stay indoors after reports that a female lion was at large.\n\nA “loose, dangerous animal” was reportedly sighted in the Potsdam region on Thursday morning, said local police.

Jon Elswick/AP\n\nThere are other questions, of course. Did he take the material because he thought they were “cool,” like some kind of trophy? Or did he see some advantage in having them, The New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman wondered during an appearance on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday.\n\nWere the documents related to Roger Stone’s pardon by Trump somehow key evidence? What is behind the appearance of material on the “President of France” in the receipt for what was taken?\n\nThe imagination runs wild in the absence of facts.\n\nTrump has now demanded the documents be returned, even though presidential papers, under US law, are not his property.\n\nThe most tantalizing detail is that 11 sets of documents were classified.\n\nIt’s shining a light on the system of classification by which the government hides information from its people in the name of everyone’s national security.\n\nMore than a million people have Top Secret clearance\n\nIt’s actually a very large universe of people with access to Top Secret data.\n\nThe Director of National Intelligence publishes what is described as an annual report, “Security Clearance Determinations,” although the most recent one I could find was from 2017.\n\nIn it, more than 2.8 million people are described as having security clearance as of October 2017 – more than 1.6 million have access to either Confidential or Secret information and nearly 1.2 million are described as having access to Top Secret information.\n\nThere are additional people who have security clearance but don’t currently have access to information. This includes civilian employees, contractors and members of the military.\n\nAgencies control their own classified data. They are supposed to declassify it\n\nThat doesn’t mean more than 1 million people have access to whatever Top Secret documents were lying around Mar-a-Lago. Each agency that deals in classification has its own system and is supposed to be involved in declassifying its own documents.\n\nTrump’s defenders have argued he had put in place an order to declassify any documents he took from the Oval Office to the residence during his time in the White House, although professionals have said this claim can’t be true.\n\n“The idea that the president can declassify documents simply by moving them from one physical location to another is nonsense on so many levels,” said Shawn Turner, a CNN analyst and former director of communication for US National Intelligence, during a Monday appearance on “Inside Politics.”\n\nThere’s an official process\n\nTurner said the process for declassification must include signoff from the agency that classified the information in the first place in order to protect the intelligence-gathering process, its sources and methods.\n\nPresidents have periodically used executive orders to update the official system by which classified information is declassified.\n\nMost recently, then-President Barack Obama put in place Executive Order 13526 in 2009. That’s still the official policy since neither Trump nor President Joe Biden updated it.\n\nThe government might soon change the process\n\nBiden started a review of how classified data is handled earlier this summer. Here’s an exhaustive Congressional Research Service report on the declassification process.\n\nBiden’s review will reexamine the three general levels of classification.\n\nLevels of classification\n\nCNN’s Katie Lobosco wrote a very good primer on classified data last week. Here’s her description of the three levels of classification:\n\nTop Secret – This is the highest level of classification. Information is classified as Top Secret if it “reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security,” according to a 2009 executive order that describes the classification system.\n\nA subset of Top Secret documents known as SCI, or sensitive compartmented information, is reserved for certain information derived from intelligence sources. Access to an SCI document can be even further restricted to a smaller group of people with specific security clearances.\n\nSome of the materials recovered from Trump’s Florida home were marked as Top Secret SCI.\n\nSecret – Information is classified as Secret if the information is deemed to be able to cause “serious damage” to national security if revealed.\n\nConfidential – Confidential is the least sensitive level of classification, applied to information that is reasonably expected to cause “damage” to national security if disclosed.\n\nWhat kinds of things are Top Secret?\n\nThe former CIA officer David Priess, who is now publisher of the website Lawfare, said on “New Day” that no matter the specific classification, it’s information the government has an interest in not being made public.\n\nIt could be intelligence gathered on the North Korean nuclear program or Russian military operations, for example.\n\nLeaks can be disastrous or deadly\n\nThe government often gets this type of information by asking people to risk their lives or using technology it doesn’t want adversaries to know about.\n\nTalking about it on Monday morning, Priess became emotional.\n\n“Exposing this information put people’s lives at risk,” he said. “That’s not a joke. We know people who have died serving their country this way.”\n\nWhat took so long?\n\nThe larger question than what’s classified, Priess argued, is why, if the government knew the documents were at Mar-a-Lago, it took investigators so long to go get them.\n\nIn order for a president to declassify anything, he argued, there still needs to be a paper trail so everyone knows something is declassified.\n\n“If they’re not marked declassified and other documents with the same information aren’t also declassified, did it really happen? If there’s no record of it, how do you even know?”\n\nWe may not know more for a very long time\n\nThe problem now may be that imaginations will run wild about what is in the documents.\n\nIt could be a very long time before American voters have any idea what this was all really about.\n\n“Technically we won’t see any further action on this case on the legal docket unless and until DOJ brings criminal charges against any person,” said CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig, also on “New Day.”\n\nRELATED: DOJ opposes making public details in Mar-a-Lago search warrant’s probable cause affidavit\n\nAlready there is some speculation that rather than pursue charges, the government was simply trying to secure the data.\n\nClassified information can stay that way for years and years – between 10 and 25, according to the declassification guidelines signed by Obama.\n\nThe standard is that if something no longer needs to be classified, it should be declassified. And if it needs to be classified past that 25-year period, it can be.\n\nLook at the Top Secret documents of yore\n\nThe FBI, CIA and State Department all have online reading rooms of previously classified data released through the Freedom of Information Act. None of it is very recent stuff.\n\nThe case of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago documents seems special, however, and there are already bipartisan calls from Sens. Mark Warner and Marco Rubio – the top elected officials on the Senate Intelligence Committee – to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for more information about what was taken by the FBI.\n\nExamples of prosecutions\n\nProsecutions for mishandling of classified data can involve high-profile figures.\n\nFor example, retired general and former CIA Director David Petraeus gave classified information to his mistress, who was writing a book about him. He ultimately pleaded guilty, paid a $100,000 fine and got two years of probation.\n\nWhat data did he mishandle? From CNN’s report at the time: During his time as commander in Afghanistan, Petraeus kept personal notes including classified information in eight 5-by-8 inch black notebooks. The classified information (included) identity of covert officers, war strategy, notes from diplomatic and national security meetings and security code words.\n\nOther figures are not as familiar – like Asia Janay Lavarello, a civilian Defense Department employee working in the US Embassy in Manila, who took classified documents to her hotel room and her house while she was working on a thesis project.

Farmers say the animals multiply quickly and destroy their crops and land, which can lead to massive soil erosion and other environmental issues.\n\n“Biological invasions are a major cause of environmental and economic disruption,” researchers wrote.\n\n“(And) the colonization of Australia by the European rabbit is one of the most iconic and devastating biological invasions in recorded history.”\n\nUsing historical accounts, researchers were able to piece together genetic evidence linking this invasion to English rabbits imported in 1859 by a settler named Thomas Austin, tracing the population back to Austin’s birthplace in England.\n\nAccording to historical records, Austin had started off with just 24 rabbits on his sprawling Melbourne estate. But within three years, the animals had multiplied into the thousands – and kept on breeding, researchers noted.\n\n“Our findings show that despite the numerous introductions across Australia, it was a single batch of English rabbits that triggered this devastating biological invasion – the effects of which are still being felt today,” said lead author Joel Alves, also a researcher at the University of Oxford.\n\n“That single event triggered this enormous catastrophe in Australia; the fastest colonization rate for an introduced mammal ever recorded.”\n\nWild rabbits gather to drink. Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhile Austin was not the first person to introduce rabbits to Australia – five of the animals had been aboard the First Fleet of British ships that reached Sydney in 1788 and at least 90 more importations were made over the next 70 years – it was the descendants of his 24 rabbits that would come to dominate the continent, the study said.\n\nAnd it concluded that nearly all of Australia’s 200 million wild rabbits can be traced to that fateful shipment he received in 1859.\n\n“Environmental change may have made Australia vulnerable to invasion,” researchers said. “But it was the genetic makeup of a small batch of wild rabbits that ignited one of the most iconic biological invasions of all time.”\n\nThe researchers also studied how the population of rabbits had managed to survive and thrive in Australia’s harsh wilderness.\n\nGenetic analysis revealed that unlike earlier Australian rabbits, which displayed domesticated traits like “tameness, floppy ears and fancy colored fur,” rabbits descended from Austin’s brood had a large amount of wild ancestry.\n\n“If animals are bred for domestication, one of the things they lack is anti-predator behavior, (which) is both learned and also evolved,” said study co-author Mike Letnic of the University of New South Wales.\n\nRabbit plagues have occurred several times throughout parts of Australia for decades. The continent is still struggling with its wild rabbit population today.\n\nThe report, its researchers said, showed the importance of maintaining strict biosecurity in Australia.\n\n“These findings matter because biological invasions are a major threat to global biodiversity and if you want to prevent them you need to understand what makes them succeed,” researchers said.\n\n“The (event) serves as a reminder that the actions of just one person, or a few people, can have a devastating environmental impact.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/us/everytown-weak-gun-laws-high-gun-deaths-study/index.html", "title": "States with weaker gun laws have higher rates of firearm related ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA study published in January by a leading non-profit organization that focuses on gun violence prevention found that there is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings.\n\nThe study by Everytown for Gun Safety determined that California had the strongest gun laws in the country. Hawaii topped the list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country while Mississippi led the country with both the weakest gun laws and highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n“What this project does, is show what we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save lives,” said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund. “We think this is going to be a really important tool for lawmakers, reporters and advocates that have been looking for the kind of visual tool that can make that case clearly.”\n\nThe findings of the study have come into sharp focus following a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, on Tuesday, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. Officials told CNN that the gunman legally purchased two assault rifles for his 18th birthday.\n\nTexas has steadily loosened restrictions on gun ownership over the past several years. Last September, legislation went into effect allowing most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training. Texas is ranked 34 out of 50 states in Everytown’s gun law strength ranking.\n\nTo compile its list, the group used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates with 50 policies that they say are scientifically proven to be effective in preventing gun violence, Suplina said.\n\nThe research team then weighed the list of gun safety policies based on their efficacy, ranked each state on its implementation of those policies and compared that score with the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said.\n\nThe CDC’s data includes homicides, accidental killings and suicides committed by guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 people in the United States were killed with a firearm in 2020 – more than half died by suicide.\n\nThe analysis, first reported by CNN, put California at the top of the list for gun law strength – a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, with a low rate of 8.5 gun deaths per 100,000 residents, and below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the country with the second strongest gun law score. It also has the lowest rate of gun ownership, with firearms in 9% of households, the data shows.\n\nFew gun control laws passed as 2022 sessions wrap\n\nAs state legislatures wrap up their 2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers will consider a breadth of bills that either loosen or expand gun protections across various states.\n\n“I have seen firsthand in California that the work we have done to strengthen gun laws has been both life-saving and effective,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “Gun laws work, and we need them across the board to ensure that felons, domestic abusers, and those with mental health issues can’t simply go to the next state over to circumvent the very laws meant to keep guns out of their hands.”\n\nCNN reached out to the National Rifle Association (NRA) to comment on the research before it was first published in January, but it declined to do so before seeing the data.\n\nMississippi has the weakest gun laws with a score of 3 out of 100 and has a rate of 28.6 gun deaths per 100,000 residents – the highest of all states, the research shows.\n\nMassachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 policies and has the second-lowest rate of gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of the gun safety policies and the fourth highest rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana and Wyoming are among the top five states with the highest gun deaths and the weakest gun safety laws.\n\n“Lawmakers in the states at the bottom can’t pretend to be ignorant about the importance of gun laws after looking at this report,” said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six educators.\n\nMother and activist DeAndra Dycus said the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is “tearing our community apart.”\n\nNearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, DeAndre “Dre” Knox, was shot in the back left side of his head at a birthday party in Indianapolis when shots were fired during a confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, now 21, survived after being on life support for several days, Dycus said, and he currently lives in a facility with non-verbal quadriplegic paralysis.\n\n“As a mother, when I look at him, I see everything that was taken away,” Dycus said. “My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He was on this road to being something great.”\n\n“But on the flip side, I see this little boy who has made such an impact, not just on our city but our country, as it pertains to what it looks like to survive,” she said. “Dre has embodied that.”\n\nMembers of Moms Demand Action protest in Texas on Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Austin, Texas, after Gov.

These include requirements for a background check and/or permits to purchase handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns in public; the secure storage of firearms; the rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that temporarily remove a person’s access to firearms when there is evidence that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others, according to Everytown.\n\nLast year, several conservative states – including Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, Utah and Wyoming – passed legislation allowing some form of permitless carry as President Joe Biden pushed forward executive actions to address gun violence following several high-profile mass shootings. But Congress has shown little to no movement on passing any meaningful federal gun reforms.\n\nA memorial outside of Oxford High School on December 3, 2021, in Michigan.

Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn Texas, the controversial “constitutional carry” legislation went into effect in September that allows most Texans who legally own a firearm to carry it openly in public without obtaining a permit or training.\n\nSupporters of the bill have argued that by removing the licensing requirement they are removing an “artificial barrier” to residents’ right to bear arms under the Constitution and ensuring more Texans have access to “the protection of themselves or their families” in public. But law enforcement officials and experts have expressed concerns that the open carrying of firearms makes it more difficult for police to quell violence.\n\n“As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to rise in this country, we’ve also seen people who open carry start out at marches and rallies and then show up in elected officials’ homes, in polling places, statehouses and then on January 6th at the US Capitol,” Watts said.\n\nAccording to Watts, the shooting in a Michigan high school in December that killed four students is a “textbook example” of why laws that require the secure storage of firearms are essential to gun safety.\n\nThe alleged gunman in that shooting, 15-year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fatally shooting four classmates and wounding several others on November 30. His parents were charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter in the same incident. All three have pleaded not guilty.\n\nProsecutors allege that James Crumbley, the father of the suspected shooter, bought the gun used in the shooting four days earlier. The incident prompted outrage over Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, arguing that the shooting could have been prevented.\n\nOnly 23 states currently have some semblance of a secure storage requirement, Watts said.\n\nLast year, Everytown successfully worked to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colorado, and Oregon, among others, according to Watts.\n\nDuring this year’s legislative session, Watts said the organization would work with lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in at least 14 states. States such as California, Michigan and New Jersey are working on first-of-its kind legislation that requires parents to be notified about secure storage.\n\nEverytown’s research shows that 21 of the country’s states have rejected Stand Your Ground laws, which allow individuals to use deadly force in public as self-defense even if they can safely walk away from the situation.\n\nA Chicago police officer investigates a fatal shooting in the Hyde Park neighborhood in November 2021. John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Getty Images\n\nDespite strong gun laws, some states still feel the effects of being close to a state with more lax regulations. For example, Illinois has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in the country, but its neighboring state of Indiana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina says.\n\nAccording to Suplina, this could explain why such a high number of guns purchased in Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice charged six Indianapolis residents related to the straw purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said more than 20 of the guns were recovered in Chicago after being used in violent crimes, including murder.\n\nGun violence overall has risen during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of the country’s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020, and most of them were a result of gun violence, according to a CNN analysis of police department data. For many cities, the elevated rates of homicide continued into 2021.\n\nWhile experts say the reasons for the rise in homicides are varied, murders are increasingly carried out with guns. The increase in gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated that about 77% of reported murders in 2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74% in 2019. The agency reported that the number of homicides increased by nearly 30% from 2019, the largest single-year jump the agency has recorded.

In a study published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists mapped the glacier’s historical retreat, hoping to learn from its past what the glacier will likely do in the future.\n\nThey found that at some point in the past two centuries, the base of the glacier dislodged from the seabed and retreated at a rate of 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) per year. That’s twice the rate that scientists have observed in the past decade or so.\n\nThat swift disintegration possibly occurred “as recently as the mid-20th century,” Alastair Graham, the study’s lead author and a marine geophysicist at the University of South Florida, said in a news release.\n\nThe floating ice edge at Thwaites Glacier margin in 2019.

Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier, located in West Antarctica, is one of the widest on Earth and is larger than the state of Florida. But it’s just a faction of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which holds enough ice to raise sea level by up to 16 feet, according to NASA.\n\nAs the climate crisis has accelerated, this region has been closely monitored because of its rapid melting and its capacity for widespread coastal destruction.\n\nThe Thwaites Glacier itself has concerned scientists for decades. As early as 1973, researchers questioned whether it was at high risk of collapse. Nearly a decade later, they found that – because the glacier is grounded to a seabed, rather than to dry land – warm ocean currents could melt the glacier from underneath, causing it to destabilize from below.\n\nIt was because of that research that scientists began calling the region around the Thwaites the “weak underbelly of the West Antarctic ice sheet.”\n\nA workboat recovering the Rán autonomous vehicle in one of the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula during the expedition to Thwaites Glacier in 2019. Alexandra Mazur/University of Gothenburg\n\nIn the 21st century, researchers began documenting the Thwaites’ rapid retreat in an alarming series of studies.\n\nIn 2001, satellite data showed the grounding line was receding by around 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) per year. In 2020, scientists found evidence that warm water was indeed flowing across the base of the glacier, melting it from underneath.\n\nAnd then in 2021, a study showed the Thwaites Ice Shelf, which helps to stabilize the glacier and hold the ice back from flowing freely into the ocean, could shatter within five years.\n\n“From the satellite data, we’re seeing these big fractures spreading across the ice shelf surface, essentially weakening the fabric of the ice; kind of a bit like a windscreen crack,” Peter Davis, an oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told CNN in 2021. “It’s slowly spreading across the ice shelf and eventually it’s going to fracture into lots of different pieces.”\n\nMonday’s findings, which suggest the Thwaites is capable of receding at a much faster pace than recently thought, were documented on a 20-hour mission in extreme conditions that mapped an underwater area the size of Houston, according to a news release.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Bill Nye's warning about 'doomsday' glacier (2021) 02:30 - Source: CNN\n\nGraham said that this research “was truly a once in a lifetime mission,” but that the team hopes to return soon to gather samples from the seabed so they can determine when the previous rapid retreats occurred. That could help scientists predict future changes to the “doomsday glacier,” which scientists had previously assumed would be slow to undergo change – something Graham said this study disproves.\n\n“Just a small kick to the Thwaites could lead to a big response,” Graham said.", "authors": ["Angela Fritz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/09/19/american-xl-bully-breed-dog-uk-ban/70901737007/", "title": "XL bully breed: New UK ban could take dogs from owners", "text": "U.K. pet owners could be facing a tough road ahead if they own a certain breed of dog, thanks to a new ban proposed by government officials.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced Friday a plan to bar what he calls the \"American XL Bully\" dog from the U.K., following a series of attacks that have been blamed on the breed. This law would not only make it an offense to own, breed, gift or sell an XL bully, but may also give authorities permission to confiscate animals, even if they that do not have a record of aggression.\n\nWhile owners would have the opportunity to apply for a court-ordered exemption, they could also be subjected to heavy fines and potential jail time.\n\nSunak called the dogs “a danger to our communities\" during the announcement, where he also shared the rule will go into effect by the end of the year.\n\nThe act would add the American XL Bully breed to an existing list under the Dangerous Dogs Act of 1991, which currently bans the Pitbull terrier, Japanese tosa, dogo Argentino and the fila Brasileiro.\n\nHowever, the \"American XL Bully\" is not a breed recognized by the U.K.’s Kennel Club and has not otherwise been defined, meaning officials need to first determine in certain terms what dogs qualify as being part of the breed.\n\nAccording to a statement released by Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Thérèse Coffey, the government plans to \"convene experts to define the ‘American XL bully’ breed type. This group will include police, canine and veterinary experts, and animal welfare stakeholders.\"\n\nIn another statement, she referred to a series of recent attacks, including a deadly attack on Thursday and one earlier in the month involving an 11-year-old girl. \"Dog attacks are devastating for victims and their families and it is clear that more now needs to be done to stop them and protect the public,\" the statement reads. \"That is why we are taking decisive action to ban the American XL Bully.\"\n\nU.K.’s Chief Veterinary Officer Dr. Christine Middlemiss told BBC over the weekend that there will be an \"amnesty\" plan in place, which will require owners who already have the dogs to follow staunch guidelines. Keeping your family pet will entail registering it with the government, muzzling and leashing it when outside at all times and purchasing insurance.\n\n\"But if you comply with these actions, and that means we'll know where these dogs are, which will be a massive benefit, then yes, absolutely you will be able to keep your dog,\" she told the outlet.\n\nStores implement dog bans:Publix-style dog bans make it safer for service dogs and people who need them, advocates say\n\nExperts, citizens respond to proposed ban\n\nWhile multiple groups have advocated for the ban to be put in place, especially following the series of suspected attacks, experts including veterinary groups and international animal welfare organizations have spoken out in opposition. A petition called \"Bad owners are to blame not the breed - don't ban the XL bully\" has also gained widespread support, receiving over half a million signatures in just a few days.\n\nA spokesperson from the Dog Control Coalition, made up of RSPCA, Blue Cross, Battersea, Dogs Trust, Hope Rescue, Scottish SPCA, The Kennel Club and British Veterinary Association, said in an emailed statement: “The recent incidents are deeply distressing, and our thoughts are with all those involved and affected. The biggest priority for everyone involved is to protect the public - but banning the breed will sadly not stop these types of incidents recurring.\"\n\nThe organization criticized the proposed legislation for what it called a lack of data and evidence. In the over 30 years since the Dangerous Dogs Act was put in place, dog bites and attacks have only increased, according to the organization. This is because banning certain breeds doesn't address the root problems, which they say are unscrupulous breeders and irresponsible owners.\n\n“The coalition urges the Prime Minister to work with them to fully understand the wide-reaching consequences of his decision to ban American bully XLs, which will have significant impacts on owners, the animal welfare sector, vets, law enforcement and the public.\"\n\nStudent loans could mean pet surrenders:Pet shelters fill up in hard times. Student loan payments could leave many with hard choices.\n\nCould a similar bully breed ban happen in the US?\n\nBreed restrictions are not entirely uncommon in the U.S. and are sometimes written into housing contracts, insurance plans and city ordinances. Sometimes, the restrictions reach a state level, something that organizations like the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) actively fight against.\n\nAccording to ALDF Strategic Legislative Affairs Manager Alicia Prygoski, the reason experts fight these blanket bans is that they are ineffective and ignore other, more successful techniques.\n\n\"Restricting dogs based on their appearance or perceived breed is a drastic reactionary policy move that is not effective and it has the potential to tear families apart and put countless dogs and responsible guardians at risk,\" she told USA TODAY. \"There are safe alternatives, there are alternatives that will help facilitate safer communities and protect both dogs and humans.\"\n\nPrygosk shared that instead of breed restrictive policy, lawmakers should focus on education, guardian responsibility and breed neutral dangerous dog laws. These would entail things like enforcing leash laws, targeting reckless dog owners and breeders, protecting animals against abuse and fighting, and bolstering community education and sources around proper and responsible dog ownership.\n\n\"Studies have shown that when these alternatives are prioritized versus implementing a knee jerk breed-based restriction, incidences of aggression and biting decrease,\" Prygosk shared.\n\nWhile she called the news out of the U.K. disappointing, she said that trends here in the U.S. have been more encouraging. In recent years, governments at all levels across the country have made the decision to repeal what Prygosk called \"outdated\" ordinances restricting or banning breeds outright.\n\nSeveral states like Florida, Illinois and Colorado have also implemented legislation to prohibit local governments from making breed-restricting policies in the first place and barring the same restrictions within insurance coverage and public housing.\n\nOn a federal level, the Pets Belong with Families Act was re-introduced to Congress in June, which would prohibit restrictions on pets in public housing based on breed.\n\n\"It's really clear that there is momentum for doing away with these antiquated breed based restrictions and there's significant recognition that alternatives to these policies are more effective in keeping communities safe,\" said Prygosk. \"It's a really encouraging trend that we're seeing across the country and we're going to keep fighting to ensure that it continues.\"\n\nWhile there are still some municipalities in the U.S. that have these restrictions, Prygosk said the overall trend is moving in the opposite direction. It is highly unlikely a ban similar to that proposed in the U.K. would go into effect here, she shared, as more and more of our existing laws targeting dog breeds are being squashed.\n\n\"Our hope is that as we're trying to do away with these unfair policies at all levels of government, those municipalities will see that shifting the focus away from dog breed and toward responsible dog guardianship and common-sense breed, neutral laws will actually keep communities safer,\" Prygosk said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/05/health/us-women-health-care/index.html", "title": "Study of wealthy nations finds American women most likely to die of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new study found that women in the US face the highest rates of preventable and maternal mortality when compared with women in 10 other wealthy nations.\n\nAccording to data collected by the Commonwealth Fund and published Tuesday, American women have an avoidable mortality rate of 198 per 100,000, the highest of any nation included in the study. The United Kingdom had the next highest rate, at 146 per 100,000.\n\nThe US also had the highest maternal mortality rate: 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, more than triple the rate of any other country studied. When looking only at Black maternal mortality, the rate jumped to 55.3 deaths per 100,000 live births.\n\nBy comparison, in Norway in 2019, the last year for which data was available, there were zero maternal deaths.\n\n“A high rate of cesarean sections, inadequate prenatal care, and elevated rates of chronic illnesses like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease may be factors contributing to the high U.S. maternal mortality rate.

(A nanogram is equivalent to one billionth of a gram.)\n\nPeople in “vulnerable life stages” – such as during fetal development in pregnancy, early childhood and old age – are at high risk, the report said. So are firefighters, workers in fluorochemical manufacturing plants and those who live near commercial airports, military bases, landfills, incinerators, wastewater treatment plants and farms where contaminated sewage sludge is used.\n\n“These chemicals are ubiquitous in the American environment. More than 2,800 communities in the US, including all 50 states and two territories, have documented PFAS contamination,” said Calonge, who is also an associate professor of family medicine at the School of Medicine on Colorado University’s Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nPart of the committee’s fact-gathering process was listening to citizens at town halls across the country. Pennsylvanian Hope Grasse, who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer at age 25 after growing up near a naval base, described how her doctors laughed when she mentioned chemical exposure.\n\n“They made me feel small; they made me feel stupid and embarrassed even just asking the question,” she said at an April 2021 town hall, which was quoted in the report. “Clearly, they didn’t have any information about environmental components (of disease).”\n\nMichigan resident Sandy Wynn-Stelt discovered a landfill had contaminated her home’s drinking water, according to the report. Levels were 1,000 times above what the Environmental Protection Agency considered safe, she said. After paying for a blood test out of pocket, she and her doctor found early-stage thyroid cancer.\n\n“This report is a positive step forward. It’s saying very clearly that exposure in a certain range is cause for concern,” said toxicologist Linda Birnbaum, former director of the US Health and Human Services National Toxicology Program and National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.\n\n“Findings by the National Academies not only impact how scientists and physicians look at a topic, but how regulators and Congress do as well,” said Birnbaum, who was not involved in the report. “And I think that’s very, very important.”\n\n‘Half-life’ exposure\n\nLiving near a major source of PFAS isn’t the only way to be exposed. Carpets, couches, nonstick cookware, stain-resistant clothes, cell phones, cosmetics, the lining of fast-food wrappers – the list of popular products that contain PFAS are too numerous to mention and nearly impossible to avoid.\n\nPFAS are used to create nonstick surfaces including cookware. Experts suggest using stainless, ceramic or glass instead. aire images/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nIn fact, PFAS chemicals have been detected in the blood of 98% of Americans, according to a 2019 report using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\n\nIn the environment, PFAS can contaminate drinking water in public drinking water systems and private wells. The chemicals can accumulate in the bodies of fish, shellfish, livestock, dairy and game animals that people eat, according to the report.\n\nThe chemicals remain in the body until “exposure ceases,” and while blood levels may drop over time, levels of PFAS “continue to persist even after exposure ends,” the report said.\n\nThat’s because PFAS can be stored for years in different organs in the body, said academies committee member Jane Hoppin, an environmental epidemiologist and deputy director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University in Raleigh.\n\nWhy years? It’s due to the “half-life” of various PFAS substances – the time it takes for the chemical concentration in the body to be reduced by 50%, she said.\n\n“Some of these chemicals have half-lives in the range of five years,” Hoppin said. “Let’s say you have 10 nanograms of PFAS in your body right now. Even with no additional exposure, five years from now you would still have 5 nanograms.\n\n“Five years later, you would have 2.5 and then five years after that, you’d have one 1.25 nanograms,” she continued. “It would be about 25 years before all the PFAS leave your body.”\n\nVarious levels of evidence\n\nThe committee found “sufficient” scientific evidence of an association between PFAS exposure and an increased risk of adult kidney cancer and abnormally high cholesterol levels, the report said. Cholesterol contributes to cardiovascular disease, “the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year,” according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe committee found PFAS exposure was also sufficiently associated with decreased infant and fetal growth as well as decreased antibody response to vaccines in both adults and children.\n\n“Decreased immune response at a time when we’re trying to immunize the population against Covid-19 … we felt these were unique characteristics worthy of attention,” Calonge said.\n\nA number of other conditions were “suggestive” of an association to PFAS exposure. The committee had “moderate” confidence there was an increased risk for breast cancer, testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease or dysfunction and pregnancy-induced high blood pressure and preeclampsia in adults. Both adults and children could also have alterations in their liver enzymes after exposure.\n\nGaps in research for conditions also thought to be affected by PFAS – asthma, bone density, additional hormonal disruptions and neurological and childhood developmental issues, to name a few – made it difficult for the committee to come to any conclusions about definite health risks. Evidence in those areas was labeled as “inadequate or insufficient.”\n\nHowever, the committee ended its research in June 2021. “I’m sure there is more information out there that may have been published very recently,” Hoppin said.\n\n“We’re not saying there isn’t a health impact. We just didn’t have enough data to make a decision,” she added. “So I think one of the most important recommendations we made is that we should be looking at the literature every two years and updating the guidance.”\n\nA numbers game\n\nThe report recommended blood tests look for seven PFAS that the CDC currently monitors: MeFOSAA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFDA, PFUnDA, PFOS and PFNA.\n\nGreater than 20 nanograms per milliliter: If the sum of PFAS found in blood serum or plasma is 20 nanograms per milliliter or higher, the patient is at the greatest risk of adverse health effects, the committee said. (Remember that a nanogram is equivalent to one billionth of a gram.)\n\nClinicians should “encourage reduction of PFAS exposure for these patients,” look for signs of testicular cancer and ulcerative colitis and test thyroid and kidney function at all wellness visits, the report said.\n\nIn addition, doctors should prioritize screening for cholesterol, breast cancer and hypertension during pregnancy.\n\nBetween 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter: If the sum of the seven PFAS is between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter, there is a concern for adverse effects. Patients should reduce PFAS exposure and be screened for high cholesterol, breast cancer and hypertension during pregnancy.\n\nBelow 2 nanograms per milliliter: If blood concentration levels fall below 2 nanograms per milliliter, people “are not expected to have adverse health effects,” the committee said.\n\nHowever, those levels are already out of date, Birnbaum said. In June, the EPA put out interim hazard advisories that lower the levels of PFAS allowed in drinking water “so low you basically can’t even measure them.”\n\n“It’s what I would say was a ‘shot across the bow,’ basically telling municipalities, ‘Guys, there’s really no safe level of this stuff,’ ” Birnbaum said.\n\nJust how do allowable levels in drinking water compare to recommended blood serum levels? They compare because the EPA “used human studies to derive safe exposure levels, or reference doses, that were then used to calculate a drinking water advisory,” said David Andrews, a senior scientist for the Environmental Working Group, a consumer organization that monitors exposure to PFAS and other chemicals.\n\n“EPA used a blood serum level of 0.17 ng/ml,” Andrews said via email. “This serum level was significantly below 2 ng/ml and then EPA applied an additional 10x safety factor to make sure variations in response between different populations were also protected.”\n\nWhat can people do\n\nThere are ways to lower exposure to PFAS chemicals, the report said. A key method is by filtering tap water, and the report points to a database of water filters that can reduce PFAS.\n\n“The water filters that are most effective for PFAS are reverse osmosis filters, which are more expensive,” Andrews said, adding that some carbon-based filters can reduce some levels as well.\n\nAvoid microwave popcorn and do yours the old-fashioned way, experts say. Mauricio Graiki/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\n“The important part is that you have to keep changing those filters,” he said. “If you don’t change that filter, and it becomes saturated, the levels of PFAS in the filtered water can actually be above the levels in the tap water.”\n\nThe committee provided additional suggestions taken from the PFAS-REACH (Research, Education, and Action for Community Health) project, funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences:", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/28"}]}

Slash the cost of that Hawaiian or European vacation by booking a flight or a hotel room early or during the off-season.\n\nBut the same supply-and-demand principle can work against you. You pay more for electricity during peak hours, for Bruce Springsteen concert tickets, or even a parking spot when there's a sporting event. And, of course, there’s the infamous Uber surge pricing.\n\nThough not new, surge pricing – or dynamic or variable pricing, as it’s typically called in the business world – is fast becoming the norm.\n\nWhat is surge pricing?\n\nMore fast-food joints, restaurant chains and brick-and-mortar retailers are taking advantage of technological advances to tap into real-time trends and swiftly adjust prices, sometimes in seconds.\n\nIt’s a tempting proposition for big businesses that can dramatically increase revenue with slight pricing changes.\n\nWendy’s was the latest to say it will fluctuate prices of chicken nuggets or a classic chocolate Frosty based on demand.\n\nIn a conference call earlier this month, Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner said the fast-food chain would experiment with dynamic pricing as early as next year.\n\nWendy's surge pricing\n\n“Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling,” he said. “As we continue to show the benefit of this technology in our company-operated restaurants, franchisee interest in digital menu boards should increase, further supporting sales and profit growth across the system.”\n\nThe response on social media was mixed.\n\n“If I ate at Wendy’s, I’d sit in the drive thru waiting for the surge pricing period to end,” commented one consumer on the social media platform Threads.\n\nNot everyone is mad at Wendy’s. “Lots of other businesses adjust prices based on demand,” commented another.\n\nAfter the comments from Wendy's CEO caused an online commotion this week, the fast-food chain said it does not plan to hike menu prices during peak demand.\n\nThe initiative would add digital menu boards to certain stores so Wendy's could offer discounts to customers more easily, \"particularly in the slower times of day,\" Wendy's said.\n\n\"We said these menuboards would give us more flexibility to change the display of featured items. This was misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest,\" the company said.\n\nWhat’s clear: The days of fixed prices that began in 1876 when a Quaker merchant introduced price tags at his department store in Philadelphia may soon be behind us.\n\nResearch and advisory firm Gartner predicts that by 2025, the top 10 global retailers will use dynamic pricing to take advantage of mismatches between supply and demand.\n\nPrices seesaw all the time on the sites of online retailers like Amazon that use algorithms and artificial intelligence to monitor competitors and glean insights into individual shoppers, adjusting prices depending on interest in the product or in the brand, said Timothy Webb, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware’s hospitality and sport business management program.\n\nCoupons and other offers are also routinely dangled in mobile apps to encourage people to make purchases.\n\n“A lot of this stuff is already happening even if you don’t realize that it is happening. If you have the Starbucks app and I have the Starbucks app, we probably have different offers,” Webb said. “We might not be in the drive-thru and they just increased the prices, but we are already paying different prices for the same products.”\n\nBut, he says, Wendy’s fans will likely see moderate, not massive, price swings during periods of peak demand.\n\n“It’s not like $200 or $300 on a flight. This is a hypercompetitive industry. If Wendy’s goes up $2 to $3 on a burger at dinner time, I would be shocked. People have too many options. They will just walk down the street and eat at Burger King instead,” Webb said. “There will just be little price changes here.”\n\nThough consumers have been accustomed to hotels and airlines modulating prices depending on demand since the 1980s, they tend to view sharp pricing increases as predatory.\n\n“Consumers, by and large, understand that companies need to make a profit. But, when a company appears to be sticking it to a consumer in a moment of need, the customer resents it,” said John Dinsmore, a marketing professor at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, who researches dynamic pricing.\n\nFifty-two percent of consumers surveyed by software company Capterra last year said dynamic pricing in restaurants is the equivalent of price gouging.\n\nA good example is Coca-Cola, Dinsmore said. “Around the turn of the century, they experimented with vending machines that raised the cost of drinks based on the outside temperature. The hotter the weather, the more expensive the soda. Consumers hated it. They understandably felt exploited. It violated consumers’ sense of price fairness. I think you are going to see a similar response to Wendy’s dynamic pricing.”\n\nDynamic pricing aims to influence consumer behavior − and price-sensitive consumers can work the system, Webb said.\n\n“If you are trying to save a couple bucks, it’s worthwhile seeing if you go to Wendy’s at 4, you are going to save a little bit of money,” he said. “There will be opportunities to find deals and pricing that are beneficial to you.”\n\nPeople who study dynamic pricing say it won't work in all facets of American life.\n\n\"Dynamic pricing is here to stay, but I believe only in certain contexts. Surge or dynamic pricing works for Uber because they are often the only option,\" Dinsmore said. \"For consumer staples like food and clothing, I have a hard time seeing it take hold. There are too many options. Consumers will adjust and competitors will undercut prices.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/02/28/wendys-menu-dynamic-pricing-surge-burgers/72765005007/", "title": "Uber for Frosty: Wendy's surge pricing means I get to pay more!", "text": "Shortly after this column was written, Wendy's – presumably intimidated by my clout – chicken-nuggeted out and released a statement saying that while it will enact \"dynamic pricing,\" the fast-food chain will not implement \"surge pricing ... raising prices when demand is highest.\" In a statement to USA TODAY, the company said \"we have no plans to do that and would not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most.\" But it will, apparently, consider lowering prices at other times, which according to math amounts to the same thing. I stand by this column. And you're welcome, American consumers. Once again, journalism has made a difference.\n\nHave you ever thought to yourself: “This cheeseburger I just bought tastes delicious, but wouldn’t it be cool if I could pay more for it during the times when most normal people want to eat?”\n\nI know I certainly have. My name is Rex Huppke and I’m a renowned USA TODAY columnist and a known person on the internet. Nothing matters more to me than status, so I was PUMPED to read about Wendy’s new plan to test dynamic pricing at its restaurants.\n\nThe plan is simple, and similar to the way ride-share companies and other retail and service providers raise and lower prices depending on demand. Dynamic pricing is a great way for fantastically wealthy corporations to make more money by leveraging the needs of not fantastically wealthy people, or “normals” as we status-havers call them.\n\nYes, Wendy's, please give me your highest priced burger!\n\nIt also gives people like me a chance to believe that intentionally spending more for something that cost less 10 minutes ago is proof that I’m cool and edgy.\n\nFace it, it's Biden vs. Trump:Can the media wake me when the general election starts?\n\nWendy’s plan is to test jacking the price of a Frosty or a Pretzel Baconator right around lunch or dinner. That makes sense, because most Americans who choose to slowly clog their arteries by eating at Wendy’s tend to do so around those times. You know, the times when people get hungry.\n\nMore hungry people + higher-priced Ghost Pepper Ranch Chicken Sandwiches = more money for Wendy’s!\n\nOverpriced fast food makes for great social media content, so I'm in\n\nAnd for someone like me? It means a chance to #PostOnInstagram a pic of me scarfing down a Loaded Nacho Triple Cheeseburger right when it’s at its HIGHEST PRICE POINT! #PoshLife #GetOnMyBurgerLevel\n\nThe company plans to test the dynamic pricing next year, and if you think I’m going to be caught dead buying low-cost midday fries, you know nothing about my personal branding.\n\nI and my fellow influencers will only feast on processed food stuff when there is maximum demand.\n\nWendy's boasts of dynamic pricing and suggestive selling\n\nDuring a recent conference call, Wendy’s CEO Kirk Tanner said this: “Beginning as early as 2025, we will begin testing more enhanced features like dynamic pricing and daypart offerings, along with AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling.”\n\nKirk, I don’t know what “daypart offerings” are, but I’ll take 12 of them, and make sure you’re charging me the peak rate. And hit me with all the suggestive selling you can. I’ll be in the corner booth eating a $39 Big Bacon Classic Double and hoping my heart doesn’t explode before I can post about it on TikTok.\n\nKirk continued: “As we continue to show the benefit of this technology in our company-operated restaurants, franchisee interest in digital menu boards should increase, further supporting sales and profit growth across the system.”\n\nAs God intended.\n\nDon't bore me with your desire to afford lunch, my $20 Frosty is melting\n\nLook, I’m sure there are some folks out there who think paying more for the same damn nugget of spicy chicken-ish stuff is profoundly unfair to consumers and likely to damage brand loyalty and drive people to other fast-food places that don’t engage in cynical time-of-day price gouging.\n\nBut what about the people who think a funny social media post of themselves paying more for a frozen-dairy desert that tastes like cold mud makes them a person people care about?\n\n$20 for flipping burgers?California minimum wage increase will cost consumers – and workers.\n\nThis is important to us, and I don’t think the needs of people who want to afford lunch should trump us wanting to floss on what used to be Twitter about dropping three-hundo at a Wendy’s.\n\nSo I say, bring on the dynamic pricing. You may lose business, but you’ll lock up the most important consumer demographic: people willing to pay anything for attention.\n\nFollow USA TODAY columnist Rex Huppke on X, formerly Twitter, @RexHuppke and Facebook facebook.com/RexIsAJerk", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/food/2024/02/01/cosmcs-mcdonalds-performance-report/72434030007/", "title": "McDonald's CosMc's blasts past traditional traffic in first month", "text": "McDonald's space-themed spinoff concept, CosMc's, has blasted off since the first location opened in Bolingbrook, Illinois in early December, introducing the new, beverage-led store to fast food fans.\n\nWith just one location currently open that operates drive-thru only, the 2,800-square-foot restaurant is significantly smaller than the average 4,000-4,500-square-foot McDonald's and offers a more limited food menu, instead focusing on trendy, fun drinks.\n\nCosMc's experience:This woman waited 4 hours to try CosMc's. Here's what she thought of McDonald's new concept.\n\nDespite only having been open in a single location for one month, CosMc's is already lapping typical McDonad's locations regarding traffic, according to a report released by analytics platform Placer.ai earlier this month.\n\nUsing location data from mobile devices, the company estimated that CosMc's doubled the number of total visits and tripled the number of visitors per square foot compared to an average McDonald's in its first month. Even so, Placer.ai estimated that the restaurant could see even more success with some tweaks to drive-thru capacity and overflow space.\n\n\"It's also worth noting that CosMc’s visitation numbers would likely have been much higher if the location had additional capacity to satisfy the overwhelming demand,\" the report said, reflecting reports that the four-bay drive-thru system still needs work, as the system lends itself to confusion and bottlenecks when there are delays with orders.\n\nWhen the concept was announced, fans speculated the chain was hoping to compete with trendy locations offering snacks and unique drinks, such as Dutch Bro. or Starbucks. As far as demographics go, it appears CosMc's has, at least in early days, attracted the younger groups who frequent the targeted competitors, with the largest customer base thus far being 22 to 29 years old, according to Placer.ai.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to McDonald's for comment on the report.\n\nMcDonald's plans to open approximately 10 CosMc’s pilot locations by the end of 2024, the chain previously announced. While exact locations have not been given, customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio metro areas can expect to be the lucky ones to see more popping up soon.\n\nCosMc's:McDonald's reveals locations for chain's new spinoff restaurant and menu\n\nWhat's on the CosMc's menu\n\nCosMc's is a new spinoff restaurant idea from McDonald's. McDonald's CEO and president Christopher Kempczinski described it as \"a small format concept with all the DNA of McDonald’s but its own unique personality.\"\n\nThe theme leans into the space-based, futurism-of-the-past aesthetic associated with a mascot named CosMc who appeared in ads in the late '80s and early '90s.\n\nThe menu features teas and lemonades, coffees, slushies, frappes and signature fruit energy-style drinks called \"Galactic Boosts.\" Some highlights include a Turmeric Spiced Latte, S'mores Cold Brew, Churro Frappe and Sour Cherry Energy Burst.\n\nWith seven iced tea and lemonade flavors, four Galactic Boost energy drinks, 11 coffee and tea-based beverages and five frappe flavors, along with the traditional list of soft drinks and milkshakes, CosMc's has a lot to offer those looking for something new.\n\nThe food menu is a little more limited but equally unique, featuring a Spicy Queso Sandwich, a Creamy Avocado Tomatillo Sandwich, Pretzel Bites, Savory Hash Brown Bites, a snack box and stuffed pastry bites called McPops. There are also cookies, sundaes, McFlurries, ice cream and three traditional McMuffin options.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/12/11/wasabi-benefits-memory-boost-study/71884622007/", "title": "Study: Wasabi a big boost for memory, brain function", "text": "Sushi lovers, listen up.\n\nNew research has found that wasabi is much more than a condiment with a kick. It's active ingredient, 6-MSITC, is now not only a known antioxidant and anti-inflammatory, but also has been linked to improved short- and long-term memory.\n\nThe study, published recently in the journal Nutrients by researchers at Tohoku University, split 72 healthy volunteers between the ages of 60 and 80 into two groups. One received 100 milligrams of wasabi extract and the other got a placebo pill with zero wasabi.\n\nAfter three months of daily use, this is what was found:\n\nWasabi's newly discovered benefit\n\nAfter a few short months, those given 100 milligrams of wasabi daily were tested on language skills, concentration and ability to carry out simple tasks. All were showing boosts in memory, both short- and long-term.\n\n\"We knew from earlier animal studies that wasabi conferred health benefits,\" lead researcher Rui Nouchi, an associate professor at Tohoku University's Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, told CBS News.\n\n\"What really surprised us was the dramatic change. The improvement was really substantial,\" Nouchi shared.\n\nEpisodic memory – the ability to learn, store, and retrieve information – increased by an average of 18% in the wasabi subjects, who also scored on average 14% higher overall than those given the placebo pill.\n\n6-MSITC, again, known for its anti-inflammatory benefits, seems to reduce inflammation in the area of the brain responsible for memory – the hippocampus.\n\nWhat is a healthy diet?Why the 'healthiest' one considers things other than food.\n\nWasabi could be breakthrough for dementia patients\n\nNouchi pursued his research because of his work around dementia prevention, CBS News reported.\n\nThe recommended methods to improve brain health, such as certain diets and exercise, seem too involved for seniors to follow, Nouchi believes.\n\nAdding a daily supplement would be easier for at-risk seniors to stick with and offer more benefits than other spices used similarly, such as ginger and turmeric, he believes.\n\nThe Tohoku team will be testing wasabi on younger groups in preparation for testing on dementia patients.\n\nPure wasabi is hard to find\n\nThe pure plant, Wasabia japonica, is native to Japan and is not overabundant. What you encounter at your local sushi restaurant is likely horseradish dyed green, and up to 99% of wasabi sold in the U.S. could be fake, according to the Washington Post.\n\nSince wasabi is a member of the same Brassica family as horseradish and mustard, horseradish powder can easily be used as a substitute and go undetected, Mashed reports.\n\nPast research shows wasabi could have several other health benefits, including:\n\nHigh levels of vitamin C for immune system support\n\nAnti-inflammatory properties, as previously stated\n\nAntibacterial effects, as previously stated\n\nProtection against neurodegenerative disorders\n\nSupport for heart health\n\nHelp with weight loss\n\nSupport for gut health\n\nA boost in bone health\n\nHelp with sleep and fatigue\n\nAnticancer attributes\n\nNote: Wasabi maker Kinjirushi Co. funded the study but had no role in the study itself, the research team said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/12/11/doordash-uber-eats-tipping-prompt-new-york-city/71880256007/", "title": "DoorDash, Uber Eats to remove tipping prompt in New York City", "text": "DoorDash and Uber Eats are moving tip prompts to after deliveries are completed following a new mandate in New York City.\n\nThe online food delivery platforms announced the move to prompt customers in New York City to tip workers after a delivery is completed after the city mandated an increase in minimum hourly wages for workers, that will eventually raise to just under $20 per hour by 2025.\n\nHere's what to know about the change for New York City customers and food delivery workers.\n\nWhat's different in New York City for food delivery workers?\n\nLegislation was passed over the summer by New York City requiring a minimum wage law for restaurant delivery workers, almost tripling the rate from $7.09 per hour to $17.96 per hour, Nation's Restaurant News reported. Despite an appeal from food delivery platforms including Uber Eats, DoorDash and GrubHub, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court upheld the legislation, ensuring the minimum wage for food delivery workers would rise.\n\nThe minimum wage for app-based delivery workers in New York City decision now mandates the $17.96 per hour wage, which will eventually increase to $19.96 per hour by April of 2025.\n\nHow DoorDash and Uber Eats is removing the tipping prompt in NYC\n\nIn New York City, both Uber Eats and DoorDash will move the prompt for customers to tip their delivery workers, both companies announced in December. This change will not apply to any customers outside of New York City.\n\nDoorDash said the option to tip within the app for customers in New York City will move to after checkout. Customers will be able to tip their delivery worker after checkout and up to 30 days after they order, and DoorDash said 100% of tips will go directly to the worker.\n\nDoorDash said workers for the app who deliver in New York City will now earn at least $23.93 per hour of active time, excluding tips. Any earnings will be reviewed weekly to see if their pay meets the earnings minimum, DoorDash said in a release, and any workers who earn below the required minimum will receive a pay adjustment.\n\nBecause of the pay changes for delivery workers, DoorDash said it is pausing its Priority Access Program, which gave delivery workers with high ratings on the app priority on higher-paying offers.\n\nSimilar to DoorDash, Uber Eats announced that delivery workers will make at least $23.93 per hour of time spent making deliveries, and any tips will be given in full.\n\nThe tip prompt for customers in New York City will be available after their order has been delivered.

That’s great news for discount grocers like bare-bones supermarket Aldi.\n\nAldi, which requires a 25-cent deposit to use grocery carts, sells mostly store brands and doesn’t waste time on elaborate displays, might not be for everyone.\n\nBut more than one million new households shopped at Aldi in the year through September, helping rack up double-digit sales growth in that period. Foot traffic across most of its 2,200 US stores jumped about 10.5% year over year, according to Placer.ai — even as grocery sector visits were about flat.\n\nAldi’s explosive growth is part of a wider trend, experts say.\n\n“We’ve seen a pretty definitive shift in consumers starting to shop at the discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe’s and Lidl,” said RJ Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, which uses location data from mobile devices to estimate visits. Given that grocery prices are expected to stay elevated for some time, “I suspect that we’re going to continue to see visitation trends favor these discounters,” Hottovy said.\n\nAldi has been seeing new customers as inflation soars. Paul Weaver/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nStubbornly high inflation, rising grocery costs and shifts in consumer buying patterns are creating a sea change in the industry, said Joan Driggs, VP of thought leadership for IRI, a market research firm.\n\n“This is an absolute pivotal moment,” Driggs said. “Mainstream grocery stores are losing share right now.”\n\nDiscount chain Grocery Outlet (GO), who has also enjoyed increased sales in recent months, alluded to that during a recent earnings call: “We’re likely seeing some benefit of the customers shifting from, I’d say, more conventional, more expensive alternatives to the value model or to value shopping,” said CEO Eric Lindberg in August.\n\nTrends align\n\nAldi displays items in the cartons they were packed in. Annie Barker/Detroit Free Press/USA Today Network\n\nHigh grocery bills are reconfiguring shopping habits in multiple ways.\n\n“Most consumers typically shop at the store closest to home,” said Brittany Steiger, senior retail and eCommerce analyst at market research company Mintel. “Discount retailers are benefiting as consumers branch out more from their neighborhood grocer in pursuit of lower prices.”\n\nMore affluent households in particular are driving these changes. The majority of Aldi’s new shoppers over the past year have been middle- and high-income households — those who earn $50,000-$100,000 a year and $100,000-plus annually, respectively.\n\n“I think they’re discovering value,” said Scott Patton, vice president of national buying and customer interaction at Aldi. “This is a time of consumers looking for solutions,” he added. “Inflation is hitting everyone.”\n\nMore consumers are additionally switching over to store brands, also called “private label,” which are often comparable in quality and lower in price. At Aldi, about 90% of packaged goods are private-label.\n\nAldi nudges shoppers toward its label in multiple ways: Customers who aren’t satisfied with a product get a refund and a replacement as part of the chain’s “Twice as Nice” guarantee. And it often displays its own brands right next to the national brands it carries in stores, putting price differences in stark relief.\n\n“I don’t think you can underestimate the strength of all these private label offerings,” said Heather Lalley, editor in chief of Winsight Grocery Business, a trade publication. “Now we’re seeing other retailers trying to emulate them.”\n\nIn September, for example, Kroger (KR) announced a new budget private label brand called Smartway, which consolidates some of its other private label brands under one umbrella. Smartway “features the products families need to put an even more affordable meal on their table,” said Juan de Paoli, VP of Kroger (KR)’s Our Brands division, in a statement announcing the launch.\n\nIt’s an Aldi Thing\n\nAldi thinks that once customers get to know the brand, they'll stick around. Michael Snyder/The Northwest Florida Daily News/USA Today Network\n\nStill, if discount grocers want to keep their new customers coming back after inflation moderates, they’ll have to make a lasting impression.\n\nAldi, for one, is rolling out a new tagline to explain what it’s all about: It’s An Aldi Thing. The tagline, which is already live in some channels, and will launch officially this quarter, is meant to sum up what might surprise customers — like Aldi’s displaying items in cartons rather than stacking them on shelves. (It saves money on labor, which Aldi says allows it to keep prices low.)\n\n“The most important thing we can do to attract and keep new customers is to simply introduce them to Aldi,” said Patton. “Once they shop at our stores, experience our products and see how low their grocery bill can be, we are confident they’ll be back. No matter what the economic climate looks like, we know customers will still want to save time and money.”\n\nThe company also is testing an online shopping service with a select group of customers, and hopes to roll it out more broadly in the future. For now, people who want to shop online at Aldi can do so via Instacart.\n\nEven before inflation began soaring, Aldi had ardent fans including a Facebook group with 1.4 million members who share finds and product reviews. Several recent posts show dogs in Aldi pet hoodies and costumes, and Aldi’s wine-themed advent calendar has also made a splash.\n\nAs companies like Aldi work to keep up momentum, their mainstream competitors will have to figure out their own ways to make themselves attractive to shoppers, said IRI’s Driggs.\n\n“This is a dynamic industry with very low margins,” she said.

Experts, Rosie McColl and James Johnson, discuss the respective benefits of each in an article first published in The Week’s Independent Schools Guide.\n\nThe case for 11+\n\nLet’s get one thing straight. The most important factor when choosing a school for a child is whether the environment is right for them personally and whether it feels like a good fit. Only then should concerns about the age of entry point arise. And even then, it will depend on the individual child. Where one might be raring to go with a new chapter of their school life, another may not be ready.\n\nLevels of maturity are an important factor when transitioning to senior school and this partly explains why boys’ prep schools traditionally go up to year 8, while the transition point for girls is the end of year 6. As the head of an all-through girls’ school (from four to 18) with a key entry point at 11+, I do see a certain readiness to progress at this age in our new starters.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

The word “tween” has entered the parental lexicon for a reason: whether it’s hitting puberty, a sense of out-growing surroundings or a need to spread one’s wings, this can be a time of turbulence.\n\nBeing a big fish in a small pond is not all it’s cracked up to be. This is the age where friendships start to change and frustrations set in. By year 6, whether they have acknowledged this verbally or not, many children will want to explore new friendships. The prospect of a fresh start in year 7, with transition events and induction days to look forward to, can be just what is needed to keep year 6 frustrations in check. When I speak to parents after school transition events, they tell me their child is “nervous but excited” about what is to come. This opportunity to step up, explore new interests and meet new people comes just at the right time for many.\n\nArriving in year 7 also allows pupils the luxury of time. Time to focus on settling in, forming wide friendship groups and understanding how relationship dynamics change over the months and years – and all way before they get to the seriousness of the GCSE years. A lot of growing up and confidence building occurs in these years.\n\nEducationally, there is a lot to be said for an 11+ entry point. A far broader curriculum in years 7 and 8 means there are opportunities for pupils to explore new subjects before committing to GCSE options. This is the time when creative subjects – the ones that can really boost confidence – really shine. Children fall in love with new disciplines, be it coding or cooking, screen printing or drumming, Latin or lacrosse. At Brighton Girls, drama, dance, design and innovation, computer science, food and nutrition, music and art all appear throughout key stage 3. Years 7 and 8 are also an important time for learning about learning. There is time to develop study skills and revision techniques through low-stakes testing and the self- knowledge that is gained becomes invaluable as pupils progress up the school.\n\nHaving an 11+ entry is good for everyone. While younger pupils benefit from our mentoring system that sees older pupils acting as counsellors as problems and issues inevitably arise, I also think the energy and enthusiasm that 11 and 12-year-olds inject into a school bring joy to older pupils. You end up with a happy, balanced environment where GCSE and A level angst and teenage issues are counterweighted by year 7s and 8s playing, running to lunch and exuding that carefree attitude that is still unfettered by teenage cares.\n\nSchools with an 11+ entry point always offer a thriving extra-curricular scene too, especially as year 7s and 8s still have that wonderful enthusiasm for trying new things. Speak to any year 7 parents and they will tell you that their children want to experience all the clubs. Harnessing this enthusiasm is something that all schools do well at 11+. By year 9, a combination of natural cynicism and emerging passions for particular activities mean that students are more reticent about trying everything on offer.\n\nCapturing that year 7 keenness can have a huge impact. Everything is new and exciting. Many will try a sport or join an activity that they have never tried before. Pupils at Brighton Girls are queuing round the block for sea swimming, e-sports, skateboarding, politics, Spikeball, culture club and pizza and philosophy club. And when I see the quiet concentration of a 12-year-old as she shoots off the half-pipe or hear the peels of laughter as another plunges into the English Channel, I feel there’s something rather special about being able to offer such opportunities to these joyful tweens.\n\nRosie McColl, Head, Brighton Girls GDST\n\nIn praise of 13+\n\nEducation should be about what is right for the individual child. Some will thrive with the move to senior education aged 11. Others may find the transition better at a later stage. For parents, having this choice at all is one of the many positives of the independent sector.\n\nI have been lucky enough to work in four excellent independent schools, Cheltenham College, Tonbridge School, Ardingly College and now Taunton School, enjoying them all in equal measure. All but Tonbridge have an attached prep school on a single campus. At Tonbridge, Cheltenham and Taunton, 13+ is considered the start of senior education. At Ardingly I was part of a senior leadership team that oversaw the structural change from the prep finishing at year 8 to the prep finishing at year 6, shortly before a move to Taunton and a return to the 13+ structure. Why the potted history of my career? Simply to demonstrate that I am comfortable with both the 13+ and 11+ model – and believe that both work.\n\nAt Taunton School, each September more than 70 pupils move up from year 8 in our prep to the senior school. They are joined by another 25 to 30 pupils from a variety of other schools (prep schools, state schools and international schools). It’s intriguing that parents of pupils from such a variety of educational settings are happy to endorse year 9 as the senior school entry point. We work hard on the successful integration of both current and new pupils. This starts with the considered allocation of houses, ensuring an even split of skills and interests and encouraging the formation of new friendships for those pupils transitioning from the prep. They have the best of both worlds: a secure group of friends already established and the exciting arrival of a new group of pupils who bring a different dimension to their year. No doubt such integration features in 11+ schools too.\n\nSo what are the advantages of the 13+ model? Firstly, there is no rush to grow up fast. Many parents, reflecting on their own education, feel that childhood is now all too brief. There is increasing social pressure for pre-teens and early teens to adopt adult personas well in advance of their emotional and physical maturity. Some might say the preciousness of childhood should be preserved rather than the precocious inadvertently encouraged. The 13+ model does not infantilise pupils in any detrimental way but rather allows children to be just that for a moment longer.\n\nSecondly, there is a huge difference between an 11-year-old and an 18-year-old ready to sit final public exams, applying to university or about to start work, driving a car, able to vote. Many 11+ schools manage this seven-year spread of ages extremely successfully by creating a “lower school” provision for their year 7 and 8 cohort, but there is a reason why this separate experience is deemed necessary: often these youngsters don’t quite fit with the near adults wandering around the campus.\n\nThirdly, done well, the final two years of prep can be a precursor to the sixth form experience. Pupils have leadership opportunities and positions of responsibility that are hard to replicate in an 11+ environment where they must look up for their role models rather than being the role models themselves. Are positions of responsibility afforded to those in year 8 as part of a senior school environment really as relevant when they have only year 7 below them?\n\nFinally, whilst some pupils will take high stakes 11+ academic assessment for senior schools entirely in their stride, for others it will be very damaging to confidence to be told, aged 11, that you have already failed on an educational journey that has so many more years to unfold. Looking back at my own academic development, I am extremely grateful that no one was telling me during year 6 whether I had passed or failed. I think I was too busy enjoying all the elements of education and childhood that should be the focus at that time.\n\nAs a parting observation, and you’ve heard it many times before, whether you opt for 13+ or 11+, the most important thing of all is to choose the school that is going to make your child happy.\n\nJames Johnson, Headmaster, Taunton School", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Uk", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Joel Mathis", "Mark Gimein", "Devika Rao", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/09/07"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/science-health/955535/anti-vax-sovereign-citizen-defence", "title": "The anti-vaxxer's 'sovereign citizen' defence examined | The Week", "text": "Covid-19 vaccination sites across the UK have been hit by disruption caused by campaigners claiming to be immune from government rules under something called the “sovereign defence”.\n\nSome anti-vax protesters have handed out “fake legal documents” outside hospitals and schools, while others have “sought to remove Covid patients from intensive care wards”, said the BBC. Campaigners have accused the government of “vaccine genocide” in videos posted on social media, and “some groups have even held training camps for their members”.\n\nThe anti-vaxxers “believe they possess the legal power to bring leading politicians, civil servants and scientists before so-called ‘common law courts’” for alleged “crimes” related to Covid restrictions and vaccinations, the broadcaster continued. But such claims “have no basis in law”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

These fake legal “writs” urge “all constables and sovereign men and women” to arrest the recipient “on sight and without delay”.\n\nThe same month, activists also “stormed an NHS ward” at Colchester Hospital and attempted to serve staff with “bogus legal notices”, The Mirror reported. Footage of the “bizarre incident” showed the group claiming that Covid is a “hoax” and citing “evidence” of alleged law-breaking including documents about the Nuremberg Code, “a set of research ethics outlining rules on human experimentation following the Second World War”, the paper added.\n\nIdeology from the US\n\nThe anti-vax groups’ ideology stems from the Posse Comitatus, a far-right, anti-Semitic and anti-government movement that originated in the US in the late 1960s. The ideology reached the UK in the 1990s and has gained prominence here during the pandemic.\n\n“When I covered an anti-lockdown protest in London in May, the first person I encountered was a man eager to tell me why the government had no legal power over him,” wrote BBC journalist Mike Wendling in 2020.\n\nThe US authorities view the sovereign citizen ideology as an “extremist movement” and a domestic terrorism threat. According to the FBI, such extremists cause “all kinds of problems – and crimes”. The agency said many sovereign members “don’t pay their taxes”, while others “hold illegal courts that issue warrants for judges and police officers” or clog up the court system with frivolous lawsuits.\n\nSome reportedly “use fake money orders, personal checks, and the like at government agencies, banks, and businesses”. And “that’s just the beginning”, added the FBI, before outlining a series of crimes by sovereign citizens including murder and threatening judges and government officials.\n\nLink to Magna Carta\n\nBritish members of the sovereign citizen movement believe that they can “opt out” of laws with which they do not agree. This notion is based on a clause in the Magna Carta – the royal charter of English liberties that was signed in 1215 with the aim of bringing peace between King John and his barons.\n\nThe clause, also known as Article 61, states that the barons of the land can elect a group of 25 men who will have the power to “claim immediate redress” in order “to keep… the peace and liberties granted and confirmed to them by this charter”.\n\nBut the clause was removed from the Magna Carta within a year of its signing and was never incorporated into English statutory law. “There is no mention of a clause 61 or the 25 barons in the 1216 version or the ‘final’ 1225 version of the document,” explained independent fact-checking organisation Full Fact.\n\nDespite providing the basis for fundamental principles in English law, just four clauses from the Magna Carta remain valid today, including the right to a free and timely trial. “None of those still-valid clauses allows citizens to decide which laws should apply to them,” said the BBC’s Reality Check.\n\nCrime number claims\n\nSo-called sovereign citizens in the UK have recently begun using a crime reference number – 6029679/21 – in a bid to bolster their claim that vaccination centres are breaking the law.\n\nEarlier this month, four protesters stormed a chemist in Yorkshire and told staff that they would “use force” to stop them from administering Covid vaccines, reported Yorkshire Live. One of the anti-vaxxers claimed to be a “Commonwealth Constable” and that the vaccine was “under criminal investigation by the Met Police”.\n\nBut “there is no police investigation”, said Vice News. The crime number “cited religiously by anti-vaxxers” merely indicates that an allegation against the vaccine had been received by the police.\n\nA spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police told Reuters that no criminal investigation into the allegation had been launched and confirmed that “no vaccine centres have been shut down” as part of a non-existent probe.\n\nHigh-profile movement members\n\nThe crime number claims have been spread online by the anti-lockdown movement and conspiracy theorists, many of whom communicate using messaging platform Telegram.\n\nSome of these activists also have large social media followings. On 14 January, US entrepreneur Jennifer Arcuri, who is an alleged ex-lover of Boris Johnson, tweeted out the case number to her 62,000 followers with the message “Call the police. Shut it ALL DOWN. And whoever doesn’t, will be reported.”\n\nRachel Goldwasser, a research analyst for the Alabama-based Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Independent that many of the people who turn to sovereign citizen rhetoric do so “as a last-ditch attempt to gain a sense of control over their lives”.\n\nGoldwasser added that the US had been hit by escalating violence as a result of sovereign citizens and warned that immediate action was needed in the UK to prevent a similar increase. “It is only a matter of time before someone snaps,” she said.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Justin Klawans", "The Week Us", "Scott Hocker", "Devika Rao", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2016/01/29/papa-johns-tries-new-tack-challenge-pizza-hut-dominos-pizza-supremacy/79488352/", "title": "Papa John's tries new tack to challenge Pizza Hut, Domino's for ...", "text": "Aamer Madhani\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nLOUISVILLE — The battle among America's pizza chain juggernauts for a bigger slice of the $40 billion industry is about to get more heated.\n\nIn an era when industry leaders are offering two pizzas for as little as $10, Papa John's — the country's fourth biggest pizza chain in terms of market share — says it will launch an aggressive campaign to win more customers by making the case that spending a a few more bucks on your pie is worth it.\n\nCompany officials say their push will start during festivities in San Francisco ahead of the Super Bowl – historically the biggest day of the year for pizza sales – when the Kentucky-headquartered chain will have three of their NFL pitchmen J.J. Watt (a former delivery driver for rival Pizza Hut), Joe Montana and Archie Manning announce that Papa John's will pledge that any customer dissatisfied with their pizza will get their next pizza free. (The company’s most celebrated endorser and franchisee Peyton Manning will be too busy preparing to play in the Super Bowl to take part in the pitch.)\n\nThe company plans to follow its celebrity push with a national television advertisement campaign the day after the Super Bowl to market their free pizza guarantee.\n\nThe brash move comes from a company that has touted a “Better Ingredient, Better Pizza” motto for about 20 years, while its competitors increasingly offer cut-rate deals, which have added a new dynamic to the war among America's big four pizza chains. Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Caesars, and Papa John's account for about 39% of the industry's revenue.\n\nLittle Caesars, the third biggest chain in terms of sales, sells its large 'hot-n-ready' pizza for $5 in many markets. Industry leaders Pizza Hut and Domino’s have launched value menus where customers can buy two items—including pizzas, pasta, and desserts—for $10 to $11.98.\n\nPapa John’s is hardly averse to offering specials. They currently offer one large, one-topping pizza for regular price with a second one for 50 cents. But with prices that skew higher than their bigger rivals—a large pepperoni pizza goes for $15.50 at Papa John's in the Chicago market— their specials are significantly more expensive their big chain rivals.\n\n“You can’t make a silk purse with a sow’s ear,” Papa John's founder and CEO John Schnatter told USA TODAY. \"You can’t make good wine from bad grapes. If you’re serving a $5 pizza, you are either serving ingredients that are not high quality or you’re putting less on.”\n\nPizza Hut, which recently launched what it's calling its $5 flavor menu, declined to address Schnatter's comments directly. But company spokesman Doug Terfehr noted the company has been \"serving the same great-tasting pizza, at a great value\" for more than 50 years.\n\nPapa John's first introduced the free pizza guarantee in the United Kingdom last year as it was trying to differentiate their brand from Domino’s Pizza, which dominates the UK pizza scene with nearly four times as many outlets as Papa John’s.\n\nPapa John’s president and chief operating officer Steve Ritchie credited the campaign with helping boost same-store sales by “double-digit” percentage points in the United Kingdom last year. Fewer than 2% of their customers in Britain called up to complain and ask for a free pizza, Ritchie said.\n\nUnder the soon-to-be offered guarantee in the U.S., customers dissatisfied for any reason can call Papa John's within 30 minutes of receiving their pizza and they will be offered a choice of having a new pie made for them on the spot or be credited with a free pizza for another day, Ritchie said.\n\nRitchie noted that Papa John’s has scored highest or tied for the highest marks among the top four pizza chains in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for 14 of the last 16 years. But Ritchie suggested Papa John’s must do a better a job differentiating itself from rivals.\n\n“It’s really time to voice that loud and clear out to the consumer,” Ritchie said. “It’s something we’re very passionate about and prideful about. But have we conveyed what we do in the stores every day to the consumers?”\n\nThe company has seen solid sales growth in recent years. Same-store sales at stores open more than a year were up 5% for franchises and corporate stores in North America for 2015 through the end of the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Same store sales were up 7.5% in its international markets through the end of the third quarter.\n\nStill, Papa John’s growth pales in comparison to the 12,000-store chain Domino’s, which has boasted same-store sales growth in the U.S. for six straight years. In the third quarter of 2015, Domino’s reported domestic sales grew 10.5% compared to the same period the previous year. The international division also posted same store sales growth of 7.7%, marking the 87th consecutive quarter of international same store sales growth.\n\nPizza Hut is the largest pizza chain with 15,000 restaurants worldwide, but is going through a turbulent period in which it has been the weak link for its parent company, Yum Brands, the fast food behemoth that also operates Taco Bell and KFC. Pizza Hut saw same-store sales grow just 1% in the third quarter. Yum, which won't release its full fourth quarter earnings until next week, recently reported that sales at its Pizza Huts in China declined 8% in the last quarter.\n\nPapa John's Schnatter, 54, agrees the company needs to improve on telling its story. The CEO, who launched his pizza business out of a broom closet at his father's bar, stars in company's ads and has become the most ubiquitous face in the pizza industry.\n\nSchnatter, who backed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 election, also drew attention after he told shareholders that President Obama's Affordable Care Act would drive up the cost of pizza by 11 to 14 cents per order. The company's Facebook page was littered with messages from critics who said they'd be happy to pay the extra cost if it resulted in workers being covered by health care.\n\nSchnatter said he is confident the company can grow its customer base, particularly with millennials and busy mothers, by underscoring the company’s efforts to improve its quality.\n\n“The consumer is more informed about what’s good and what’s not good—millennials especially,” Schnatter said \"I think we’re skating to where the public is going.”\n\nPapa John’s latest pitch follows the company’s announcement earlier this month that it has removed all artificial flavors and synthetic coloring from its food items. In December, the company said by this summer it will transition to using only chicken that is raised without human and animal antibiotics and that is fed an entirely vegetarian diet.\n\nAt Papa John’s quality control lab and dough factory at the company’s Louisville headquarter, the company has stepped up its effort to ensure a flood of dissatisfied customers won't demand free pizzas once the company starts its quality guarantee promotion.\n\nProduction of 300 million dough balls a year for pizza crusts at Papa John’s hums along at 10 commissaries spread throughout the country, supplying more than 4,600 outlets. Even at that scale, the process of making pizza remains as much art as science, Schnatter said.\n\nOn the floor of the Louisville dough factory, one 13-person shift had well over a century of collective experience with the company. Schnatter said the the longevity of his workforce in key positions has helped make improving key facets of the business easier. It also hasn't hurt retention that the company distributed $60 million in bonuses last year, he said.\n\n“If you don’t get it right from here, you’ll see that the final product (isn’t) right,” Schnatter said over the ear-splitting din of dough being made.\n\nUpstairs from the dough factory, a team of product quality technologists in lab coats randomly test thousands of food items from throughout the Papa John’s distribution system each month Checks include the acidity of the pizza sauce, the depth of the Papa John's cookie-brownie dessert, and even the thickness of their pizza boxes.\n\nDown the hall from the quality control techs, a half dozen young analysts huddle in cubicles where they review and grade 60,000 pizzas bought at Papa John’s outlets worldwide by secret shoppers.\n\nJordan Marr carefully studied an uploaded photo of a hot and spicy pizza from a restaurant in South Korea. Among the things Marr looked for was whether the pizza captured “cheese lock”— the all-important state of cheese hitting the crust—and proper topping spread so a diner would taste the jalapeño and meat in each bite of pizza.\n\nMarr, 26, who got his start with the company working at a Papa John’s restaurant in college, gave the pizza an 8.5 on a scale of 10. The company says they want nothing graded below an 8 to be served to customers.\n\n“You think pizza making is simple, but it is not here,” Marr said.\n\nPapa John's missing Camaro found in Detroit driveway\n\nBurger King heats up the fast food cheap deal war with McDonald's, Wendy's\n\nFollow USA TODAY correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/12/business/walgreens-freezer-screens/index.html", "title": "Walgreens replaced some fridge doors with screens. And some ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nWalgreens and other retailers have swapped out the clear fridge and freezer doors at thousands of stores, instead adding opaque doors with iPad-like screens showing what’s inside. Some customers really, really aren’t into it.\n\nThe screens, which were developed by the startup Cooler Screens, use a system of motion sensors and cameras to display what’s inside the doors — as well as product information, prices, deals and, most appealing to brands, paid advertisements. The tech provides stores with an additional revenue stream and a way to modernize the shopping experience.\n\nBut for customers who just want to peek into the freezer and grab their ice cream, Walgreens (WBA) risks angering them by solving a problem that shoppers didn’t know existed.\n\nThe company wants to engage more people with advertising, but the reaction, so far, is annoyance and confusion.\n\nCooler Screens fridge doors shown at a Walgreens in Bridgeview, IL on February 7th 2022. Courtesy Henry B.\n\n“Why would Walgreens do this?” one befuddled shopper who encountered the screens posted on TikTok. “Who on God’s green earth thought this was a good idea?”\n\n“The digital cooler screens at Walgreens made me watch an ad before it allowed me to know which door held the frozen pizzas,” said someone on Twitter.\n\nAnother echoed: “@Walgreens NOBODY needs TV screen replacing doors in your cooler aisles…. Stop.”\n\nRetailers are eager to add new experiences to their physical stores. But many consumers aren’t eager to change their habits — and they certainly aren’t used to watching freezer-display ads.\n\n“People really appreciate their routines. They’re not always seeking excitement,” said Julio Sevilla, an associate professor of marketing at the University of Georgia who studies consumer behavior.\n\nDigital screens, he said, can add uncertainty and physical barriers to a simple and literally transparent process: reaching into a glass fridge.\n\nSevilla doesn’t believe consumers are looking for novelty when they visit a grocery store: “We all love to get into a supermarket and know exactly what we’re getting. I know also exactly where things are. For this type of utilitarian-related setting, people like their certainty and simplicity.”\n\nBig-name stores\n\nStill, Walgreens (WBA) and Cooler Screens are pushing forward. Walgreens (WBA) began testing the screens in 2018 and has since expanded the pilot to a couple thousand locations nationwide.\n\nSeveral other major retailers are launching their own tests with Cooler Screens, including Kroger (KR), CVS (CVS), GetGo convenience stores and Chevron (CVX) gas stations.\n\n“I hope that we will one day be able to expand across all parts of the store,” said Cooler Screens co-founder and CEO Arsen Avakian in an interview with CNN Business.\n\nCurrently the startup has about 10,000 screens in stores, which are viewed by approximately 90 million consumers monthly, according to the company. Avakian said the company aims to bring its digital displays to a broad range of retailers including those in beauty, consumer electronics and home improvement.\n\nA Walgreens spokesperson said in an email that Walgreens is “committed to exploring digital innovation in [an] effort to deliver new and different experiences for our customers.”\n\nThe spokesperson said the screens add value because they give customers relevant product information to help them decide what to buy, and that Walgreens is evaluating the pilot to decide whether to expand further.\n\n‘Moment of truth’\n\nThough not all of Walgreens’ customers are fans, Cooler Screens’ concept has attracted prominent brands like Coke (KO), Pepsi (PEP), Nestle (NSRGF), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and Monster (MNST). It’s raised more than $100 million from backers including Microsoft (MSFT) and Verizon (VZ).\n\nCooler Screens CEO Avakian said he developed the concept after watching in-store customers whip out their phones to find product information and reviews. Traditionally, in-store advertising has been limited to options like signs, promotions and prominent placement on shelves. But Cooler Screens’ targeted digital ads deliver at the “moment of truth,” Avakian said, right as consumers decide which product to pull out of the fridge.\n\nBrands can place ads spread over multiple freezers, ones that display products’ nutritional labels, or ads triggered by weather or time of day. An ice cream company might want to run ads when it’s hot outside, while a coffee brand could hit the morning rush.\n\nThe setup aims to help stores add high-margin advertising revenue to offset their core low-margin retail business. Companies pay Cooler Screens to run screen ads and retailers get a cut.\n\n“There’s a big movement in retail right now to create what’s called a ‘retail media network,’ which taps into all the ways brands can interact with that retailer digitally,” said Chris Walton, a former vice president at Target who runs the retail blog Omni Talk.\n\n‘This wasn’t a problem’\n\nCooler Screens says 90% of consumers it has surveyed prefer its digital screens to traditional fridges, and that the displays provide sales lifts for stores. (Walgreens did not comment on that.)\n\nBut beyond the confused social media posts, the tech has also attracted misinformation and conspiracy theories. Politifact last month debunked a viral Facebook video that claimed “Walgreens refrigerators are scanning shoppers’ hands and foreheads for ‘the mark of the beast.’”\n\nAvakian insists the tech is “identity-blind” and protects consumers’ privacy. The freezers have front-facing sensors used to anonymously track shoppers interacting with the platform, while internally facing cameras track product inventory.\n\nSome customers have expressed frustration with the experience. People aren’t sure whether to tap the screens or talk to them. The items on display don’t always match up with what’s inside because products are out of stock.\n\nHenry Brewer, who recently encountered one of the digital screens at a Walgreens in Chicago, said the technology felt “very in-your-face” and “intrusive.”\n\n“We see advertisements literally everywhere and now I have to go see it on the cooler?” he said. “It doesn’t just seem necessary, and I think it’s a turnoff to the consumer when this wasn’t a problem.”\n\nTo Avakian, it’s simply an expected growing pain. Cooler Screens plans to educate customers about the digital displays and launch features like voice recognition, so shoppers can ask about prices or item locations.\n\n“This is the future of retail and shopping,” Avakian said.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/03/12"}]}

Supreme Court ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday will consider whether former President Donald Trump’s role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol disqualifies him from the presidency.\n\nThe historic case could have huge consequences for this year’s election if the justices decide that Trump, the front-runner for the GOP nomination, is barred by the Constitution from returning to the White House.\n\nIt’s the biggest presidential election case since the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore in 2000, effectively confirming the election of George W. Bush.\n\nIt’s also a major test for the Supreme Court, which has been rocked by ethics scandals, criticism over its 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and low public approval ratings.\n\nAnd it's not the only case about Trump the justices will be deciding. Trump is expected to appeal a lower court's ruling that he is not immune to criminal charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat is the court deciding?\n\nThe Supreme Court is deciding whether Colorado’s highest court was wrong to exclude Trump from Colorado’s primary ballot. The state court said Trump is disqualified under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, an anti-insurrection provision added after the Civil War to keep government officials who sided with the Confederacy from returning to power.\n\nIt’s the first time the nation’s highest court will hear a case on Section 3.\n\nWhat is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment?\n\nThe provision bars people who took an oath to support the Constitution from holding office again if they engaged in insurrection. The clause says:\n\n\"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\"\n\nWho is challenging Trump's eligibility?\n\nFour Republican and two independent voters in Colorado sued to keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot. The voters include the lead plaintiff, Norma Anderson, a registered Republican. Anderson, 91, was the first female majority leader in both the Colorado House and Senate.\n\n“Our state law allows us to take certain individuals, if they don’t qualify, off the ballot,” Anderson said in a video created by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), the watchdog group representing the voters.\n\nHow did Trump v. Anderson get to the Supreme Court?\n\nAfter a five-day trial last fall, a Colorado district judge ruled that Trump had \"engaged in an insurrection\" by inciting the mob that stormed that U.S. Capitol. But the judge also concluded that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not apply to a president.\n\nAfter the voters appealed, Colorado’s top court, in a 4-3 decision, said the provision does apply to the presidency and disqualifies Trump from holding the office again.\n\nWhere else has Trump been challenged?\n\nOf the dozens of challenges to Trump filed around the country, the Colorado case is the only one that has succeeded in court so far. Maine’s secretary of state, a Democrat, ruled in December that Trump is ineligible for that state’s ballot. That decision, which Trump is appealing, is on hold until the Supreme Court rules in the Colorado case.\n\nHas anyone else been recently barred from office because of Section 3?\n\nA New Mexico judge last year disqualified county commissioner and Cowboys for Trump co-founder Couy Griffin from holding public office for engaging in insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nGriffin has appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat are Trump's arguments?\n\nTrump’s main argument is Section 3 doesn’t apply to presidents. And even if it did, he did not “engage in insurrection.”\n\n\"There was no `insurrection,'\" his lawyers wrote in a filing. \"President Trump did not `incite' anything, and President Trump did not `engage in' anything that constitutes `insurrection.'\"\n\nTrump to Supreme Court:Calling himself `presumptive nominee,' Trump tells Supreme Court to keep him on the ballot\n\nWhat are the Colorado voters' arguments?\n\nLawyers for the other side say it defies common sense to think the amendment authors wanted to protect the Constitution from every oath-breaking insurrectionist except the person who holds the highest office in the land.\n\n“By intentionally inciting a violent attack on the Capitol to cling to power,” they wrote, “Trump `engaged in insurrection’ against the Constitution.”\n\nChallengers' argument:Don't give Trump the power to unleash more `mayhem,' Colorado voters tell Supreme Court\n\nHow can I listen to the arguments?\n\nThe court is scheduled to debate Trump v. Anderson at 10 a.m. EST Thursday. The allotted time is 80 minutes but is expected to run much longer. Audio is available through the court’s website: www.supremecourt.gov.\n\nWill Trump be there?\n\nTrump is not scheduled to attend. The oral arguments are the same day as the Nevada caucuses, and Trump is expected to be in the state that night.\n\nWho will be arguing for Trump?\n\nTrump’s lead attorney is Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general of Texas who helped create the state’s six-week abortion ban that put enforcement in the hands of private citizens. He clerked for former Justice Antonin Scalia and has argued five cases before the Supreme Court.\n\nWho will be arguing for the Colorado voters?\n\nJason Murray, a Colorado trial lawyer, will be making his first Supreme Court argument when he represents the Colorado voters Thursday.

S. Supreme Court on Thursday appeared to be looking for a way to ensure stability in this year’s presidential election by not letting Colorado use an anti-insurrectionist provision of the Constitution to block former President Donald Trump from the ballot.\n\n“I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States,” Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court’s three liberal justices, told the attorney for the Colorado voters challenging Trump’s eligibility.\n\nOther justices raised concerns about a mismatch of ballots across the country if each state makes its own decisions on whether Trump –or President Joe Biden – qualifies as an insurrectionist under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment.\n\nDuring the just over two hours of oral arguments in a case with potentially huge consequences for the election, the justices focused more on the practical implications of the decision than the technical arguments over the wording of the provision.\n\n“The court seemed inclined to let the political process play out,” said Notre Dame Law School Professor Derek Muller, who has been closely following the ballot eligibility issue.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the debate.\n\nConcern about uniformity\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pressed the attorney for Trump’s challengers on what would happen if the court allows Colorado to take Trump off the ballot. Wouldn’t other states then undertake their own proceedings with potentially different outcomes – some striking Republicans and others finding reasons to exclude Democrats under their own interpretation of the 14th Amendment, he asked.\n\n“It will come down to just a handful of states that are going to decide the presidential election,” he added. “That's a pretty daunting consequence.”\n\nIt wasn’t just the court’s conservative bloc raising such questions.\n\nKagan said the question of who qualifies for the ballot sounds “awfully national,” rather than a question that can be left up to each state.\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked why the amendment’s authors would have created a situation that would result in “disuniformity” in which elections are pending and different states suddenly say one candidate is eligible and another is not.\n\nJason Murray, the attorney for the Colorado voters challenging Trump, said the amendment’s authors intent was ensuring that insurrectionists and rebels not hold office again. Letting states enforce Section 3 is an additional layer of safeguard, he said.\n\nAnd there is national oversight, he responded to Kagan, because of the Supreme Court’s ultimate review authority.\n\nWho defines insurrection?\n\nThe justices drew a distinction between clear cut qualifications for the presidency, such as age, and the less defined standard in the 14th Amendment of having “engaged in insurrection.”\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh said the term insurrection “jumps out” and raises the questions of how it’s defined and who decides if someone has engaged in it. Another section of the amendment indicates that Congress has the primary role, he said.\n\n\"It is entirely up to Congress,\" Jonathan Mitchell, Trump's attorney, said at the start of the arguments in response to the first question of the debate, which came from Justice Clarence Thomas.\n\nMurray, the opposing attorney, agreed there must be a process for determining the applicability of Section 3. But, he said, nothing in the amendment says Congress has that exclusive role.\n\n“We certainly have a long history in this country of states using their power to determine the manner of selecting presidential electors to enforce other qualifications in the Constitution,” he said.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court can interpret the amendment for the states just as it interprets other constitutional provisions, he argued.\n\nWas there an `insurrection' on Jan. 6, 2021?\n\nTrump’s lawyer had his own definition for what constitutes an insurrection – and it doesn’t include the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol.\n\nUnder questioning from Jackson, Mitchell rejected the idea that Trump’s supporters were trying to overthrow the government when they stormed the Capitol to disrupt Congress while lawmakers counted Electoral College votes.\n\n“This was a riot. It was not an insurrection,” Mitchell said. “The events were shameful, criminal, violent, all of those things, but it did not qualify as insurrection as that term is used in Section 3.”\n\nThe Supreme Court has ways to decide this case without addressing whether Trump “engaged in insurrection” and the justices did not spend much time debating that question.\n\nJustices question what is best for democracy\n\nAmid the dense legal arguments, Justice Brett Kavanaugh cut to the point by asking Trump’s opponents what is the right ruling for democracy.\n\nKavanaugh described the constitutional provision as having elusive or vague language. He questioned disenfranchising potentially millions of voters by removing a candidate from the ballot.\n\n“What about the background principle, if you agree, of democracy?” Kavanaugh asked.\n\nBut Murray, the lawyer for Colorado voters, argued the Constitution − by prohibiting insurrectionists from running for office − aims to safeguard democracy. The authors of the provision aimed to prevent people who violently broke their oaths to the Constitution from being trusted to hold power again, Murray said. In the current case, Trump tried to disenfranchise 80 million Americans who voted against him, Murray said.\n\n“The Constitution doesn't require that he be given another chance,” Murray said.\n\nCivil War shadows prohibition against 'charismatic' insurrectionists: lawyer\n\nSeveral justices questioned why states hadn’t wielded the amendment, which aimed to prevent members of the Confederacy from regaining power, against national candidates during the 150 years between its adoption and Trump’s campaign.\n\nJackson asked whether the amendment targeted local officials or even candidates for Congress from campaigning, rather than presidential candidates.\n\n“Can you speak to the argument that really Section 3 was about preventing the South from rising again in the context of these sort of local elections as opposed to focusing on the presidency?” Jackson asked.\n\nMurray said by the time the amendment was ratified in 1868, Confederates had already been pardoned. He also said ballots functioned differently at the time, with most voters writing in the names of their favored candidates rather than having a list provided.\n\n“What is very clear from the history is that the framers were concerned about charismatic rebels who might rise through the ranks up to and including the presidency of the United States,” Murray said.\n\nDid Trump get due process?\n\nKavanaugh brought up the concerns of one of the Colorado justices who complained that Trump had not received a fair shake during the district court’s five-day trial to determine his ballot eligibility.\n\nColorado Supreme Court Justice Carlos Samour, one of the three dissenters in the court’s 4-3 decision disqualifying Trump, said the litigation “fell woefully short of what due process demands.”\n\nKavanaugh said that complaint is another reason why this type of decision should not be left up to each state.\n\nMurray said Trump was able to call any witness he wanted, cross-examine the challengers’ witnesses and testify himself.\n\n“He didn’t use all of his time at trial,” Murray said. “There was ample process here, and this is how ballot access determinations in election cases are decided all the time.”\n\nTrump didn't attend hearing, but had some reaction afterward\n\nTrump didn't attend the argument, as he has recent civil lawsuits. He is campaigning again for the White House and had a political party scheduled Thursday in Nevada for the caucuses.\n\nTrump told reporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, that his political opponents had engineered the lawsuit.\n\n\"It's election interference and it's really very sad,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said he listened to the Supreme Court argument, which was available on the internet, and thought it was \"beautiful.\"\n\n\"I hope that democracy in this country will continue because right now we have a very, very tough situation with all of the radical left ideas with the weaponization of politics,\" Trump said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/08/donald-trump-supreme-court-colorado-ballot-appeal-details/72368333007/", "title": "Donald Trump's Supreme Court appeal is focused on these 5 ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Is the president an officer of the United States?\n\nHow the Supreme Court answers that seemingly simple question may determine if former President Donald Trump can return to the White House.\n\nIs \"officer of the United States\" a term of art that refers in the Constitution to appointed officials, like cabinet secretaries and the leaders of sometimes obscure government agencies, as Trump's lawyers argue? Or does it mean anyone who holds a federal office, which would subject even former presidents to the anti-insurrection provision of the 14th Amendment?\n\nThat’s a top issue the justices will tangle with Thursday when they hear Trump’s appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court’s ruling that Trump disqualified himself by ginning up the mob that rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nSupreme Court appeal:Trump case at Supreme Court: Live updates of oral arguments\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nFour of the five reasons Trump has given the justices to overturn that decision would extend beyond the Colorado case, likely putting an end to similar challenges across the country.\n\nOne would apply only to Colorado.\n\nAnd if a majority of justices reject all of Trump’s arguments? Other states would be free to toss him from the ballot, depending on each state's election laws.\n\nThat would unleash “chaos and bedlam,” Trump’s attorneys have told the court.\n\nAttorneys for the six Republican and unaffiliated voters challenging Trump’s eligibility in Colorado say the nation already witnessed, on Jan. 6, 2021, the bedlam Trump caused when he refused to accept his re-election defeat. The Constitution makes him ineligible from being in a position to do so again, they’ve told the court.\n\nTheir case hinges on a section of the 14th Amendment enacted after the Civil War to bar from office those who engaged in insurrection after previously promising to support the Constitution. The clause says:\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nHere are the reasons Trump says the 14th Amendment can't keep him off the 2024 ballot and why the other side disagrees.\n\nThe president is not an 'officer of the United States'\n\nTrump’s top argument is Section 3 of the 14th Amendment simply doesn’t apply to the presidency or to him, specifically.\n\nThe provision bars entry to “any office, civil or military, under the United States,” to someone who has previously taken an oath “as an officer of the United States” to “support the Constitution.”\n\nTrump may have held the office of president, but he is not an “officer of the United States” as that term is used in the Constitution, his lawyers argue.\n\nAlso, Trump did not promise to “support” the Constitution, when he was sworn into office, as do members of Congress and others. Instead, presidents promise to “preserve, protect, and defend” the Constitution. (Trump, the only person without government or military experience to have been elected president, also never swore an oath to support the Constitution in a prior office.)\n\nAnd while Section 3 names various government positions – such as senators and representatives – it does not mention president. Why, Trump’s lawyers argue, would the drafters of the amendment have included low-ranking military officers and even presidential electors without specifically mentioning the nation’s most prominent office if they wanted that provision to apply to the president?\n\nThe other side counters that it defies common sense to think the amendment's authors wanted to protect the Constitution from every oath-breaking insurrectionist except the person who is both head of the executive branch and commander-in-chief. That was clear from the debate over the amendment when it was ratified in 1868, attorneys for the Colorado voters argue.\n\nThe natural meaning of “officer of the United States” is anyone who holds a federal office, they say, something the president has been called since the founding of the nation. And swearing to “defend” the Constitution is at least as demanding, if not more, than promise to “support” it.\n\nTrump did not 'engage in insurrection'\n\nTrump never told his supporters to enter the Capitol, and he did not “lead, direct, or encourage any of the unlawful acts that occurred at the Capitol,” his lawyers argue.\n\nHe has never been criminally charged with insurrection, “despite the relentless and ongoing investigations of President Trump,” they wrote.\n\n(The federal indictment against Trump accuses him of conspiring to illegally overturn the 2020 election. In Georgia, he’s been charged with election racketeering for trying to interfere with the state’s presidential election. In 2021, the Senate acquitted Trump on an impeachment charge of inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6.)\n\n`There was no insurrection':Trump tells Supreme Court to keep him on the ballot\n\nLawyers for the Colorado voters contend Section 3 is not a criminal penalty and doesn’t require a criminal conviction on insurrection charges.\n\nThey also argue Trump is wrong to say he can’t have “engaged in” insurrection unless he personally committed violent acts.\n\n“Leaders rarely take up arms themselves,” they wrote in a filing. “It would make no sense to adopt a legal standard that gives a free pass to those—like Trump here—most responsible for an insurrection.”\n\nColorado voters to Supreme CourtDon't give Trump the power to unleash more `mayhem'\n\nOnly Congress should decide how Section 3 can be enforced\n\nThe 14th Amendment empowers Congress, not state courts or state officials, to enforce the ban, Trump argues. Legislation is needed because Section 3 doesn’t set up a process for determining if someone has “engaged in insurrection,\" they say.\n\nThe other side counters that, historically, states enforced Section 3 without congressional direction and the Constitution gives states broad power to limit the presidential ballot to candidates who are eligible to hold that office.\n\nSection 3 only prohibits someone from holding office, not running for office\n\nThe amendment doesn’t bar an oath-breaking insurrectionist from running for office, only from holding an office, Trump argues. Even if a candidate doesn’t qualify at the time of an election, they could by the time of inauguration because the amendment gives Congress the ability – by a two-thirds vote in each chamber − to remove the disqualification before the term begins.\n\nThat means it’s ultimately up to Congress to decide whether the provision should prevent someone from holding office, Trump argues.\n\nBut the fact that Congress was given the power to remove the ban proves that it was enforceable as soon as the amendment was ratified, lawyers for the Colorado voters counter.\n\nWaiting to decide Trump’s eligibility until tens of millions of Americans have voted is a recipe for mass disenfranchisement and a constitutional crisis, they wrote.\n\nColorado law doesn’t allow the state to order Trump’s removal\n\nColorado’s election law allows state courts to intervene in ballot disputes only to correct or prevent an error, Trump argues. Colorado’s secretary of state won’t be doing anything wrong by putting Trump on the ballot because Section 3 doesn’t apply to candidates, only officeholders, his lawyers say.\n\nThe other side counters that states have broad authority to regulate presidential elections and can exclude candidates who aren’t eligible under the Constitution. Section 3 applies to Trump unless two-thirds of the House and two-thirds of the Senate vote to exempt him, they wrote.\n\n`So much winning?'Donald Trump remade the Supreme Court. It hasn't always made him a winner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/politics/donald-trump-tax-returns-released/index.html", "title": "Key takeaways from six years of Donald Trump's federal tax returns ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSix years of Donald Trump’s federal tax returns released on Friday show the former president paid very little in federal income taxes the first and last year of his presidency, claiming huge losses that helped limit his tax bill, among other revelations.\n\nThe returns, long shrouded in secrecy, were released to the public on Friday by the House Ways and Means Committee, the culmination of a battle over their disclosure that went to the Supreme Court. They confirm a report issued from the Joint Committee on Taxation that Trump claimed large losses before and throughout his presidency that he carried forward to reduce or practically eliminate his tax burden. For example, his returns show that he carried forward a $105 million loss in 2015 and $73 million in 2016.\n\nThe thousands of pages of documents from the former president’s personal and business federal tax returns – which spanned the years 2015 through 2020 – provide a complex web of raw data about Trump’s finances, offering up many questions about his wealth and income that could be pursued both by auditors and Trump’s political opponents.\n\nHere are key takeaways from the documents reviewed by CNN:\n\nReturns shed light on questionable tax claims\n\nTrump’s returns also show the former president made several claims that auditors may question.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation, which reviewed the returns, flagged that Trump claimed a large number of questionable items on his tax returns, including eyebrow-raising amounts of interest he claims to have received from loans to his children that the bipartisan committee said could indicate Trump was disguising gifts.\n\nThe JCT argued that an auditor should investigate the loan agreements Trump made with his children, including the interest rates. If the interest Trump claims to have charged his children was not at market rate, for example, it could be considered a gift for tax purposes, requiring him to pay a higher tax rate on the money.\n\nIn each year of his presidency, for example, Trump claimed he received exactly $18,000 in interest on a loan he said he gave his daughter Ivanka Trump and $8,715 in interest from his son Donald Trump, Jr.. In 2017 to 2019, Trump said he received exactly $24,000 from his son Eric Trump, and Eric paid him $19,605 in interest in 2020.\n\nThat raises the question of whether “the loans were bona fide arm’s length transactions, or whether the transfers were disguised gifts that could trigger gift tax and a disallowance of interest deductions by the related borrowers,” the JCT said in its report.\n\n“It’s unusual to have interest in round numbers – very rare,” said Martin Sheil, former supervisory special agent for IRS’ Criminal Investigation unit. “An auditor would want to see payments, loan agreements and interest rates.”\n\nThere are also questions about Trump’s returns listing an identical amount of company expenses and income.\n\nFor example, in 2017, Trump claimed his business DJT Aerospace LLC, which operates Trump’s personal helicopter, claimed $42,965 in income. It also claimed the exact same amount – $42,965 – in expenses. In other words, every single dollar – to the dollar – that the company earned was negated by the company’s expenses, such as payroll, fuel and other items. That left the company with zero income – and nothing to tax.\n\n“Total expenses equaling total income is a statistical impossibility,” said Shiel, who added that the figures are not evidence something illegal was done. “It just doesn’t happen.”\n\nThe JCT in its report raised several similar questions. For example, it noted IRS auditors were investigating multiple so-called large unusual questionable items on Trump’s tax returns for which the regulator wanted Trump to provide supporting evidence to back up his claims.\n\nRelease comes after years-long fight\n\nThe returns were obtained by the Democratic-run Ways and Means Committee only a few weeks ago after a protracted legal battle that lasted nearly four years. The committee voted last week to release the tax returns, but their release was delayed to redact sensitive personal information like Social Security numbers.\n\nThe release of the tax returns follows a pursuit for the documents that had typically been made public voluntarily by past US presidents. Trump and his legal team continuously sought to keep his returns secret, arguing that Congress had never wielded its legislative powers to demand a president’s tax returns, which Trump said could have far-reaching implications.\n\n“The Democrats should have never done it, the Supreme Court should have never approved it, and it’s going to lead to horrible things for so many people,” Trump said in a statement following the release.\n\n“The ‘Trump’ tax returns once again show how proudly successful I have been and how I have been able to use depreciation and various other tax deductions as an incentive for creating thousands of jobs and magnificent structures and enterprises.”\n\nOther Republicans also criticized Democrats’ efforts in pursuit of the tax returns as political, with Texas Rep. Kevin Brady – the committee’s top conservative – saying the release would amount to “a dangerous new political weapon that reaches far beyond the former president and overturns decades of privacy protections for average Americans that have existed since the Watergate reform.”\n\nDuring the committee’s closed-door meeting last week, Republicans warned that the release of Trump’s tax returns by Democrats could prompt retribution once Republicans control the House next year – like going after the taxes of President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden.\n\n“I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden’s family dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. And they are begging for oversight and accountability on that,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican, according to excerpts the GOP released from the meeting. “Do we need to go down all that? Is that what you all are wishing to do?”\n\nReturns show he held foreign bank accounts while in office\n\nTrump reported having foreign bank accounts between 2015 and 2020, including a bank account in China between 2015 and 2017, his tax returns show.\n\nTrump was required to report the accounts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The filings show that the former president maintained foreign bank accounts in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and China.\n\nThe China bank account, which was reported by The New York Times in 2020, was tied to Trump International Hotels Management’s business push in the country, Trump Organization lawyer Alan Garten said at the time.\n\nThe 2020 disclosure of business dealings in China came as the Trump campaign sought to portray Biden as a “puppet” of China. Biden’s income tax returns and financial disclosures showed no business dealings or income from China.\n\nThe returns also show that Trump paid more in foreign taxes than in US federal income taxes in 2017, the first year of his presidency.\n\nIn 2017, Trump paid just $750 in US federal income taxes because of large carry-forward losses that he claimed in prior years, negating virtually all of his American tax liability. Yet Trump paid nearly $1 million in taxes to foreign countries that year.\n\nThe fact that Trump paid foreign taxes isn’t in itself surprising, but it shows how Trump’s companies and businesses interests span the globe, and how those businesses are subject to local tax laws and regulations.\n\nOn his tax return, Trump listed business income, taxes, expenses or other notable financial items in Azerbaijan, Panama, Canada, India, Qatar, South Korea, the United Kingdom, China, the Dominican Republic, United Arab Emirates, the Philippines, Grenada, US territory Puerto Rico, Georgia, Israel, Brazil, St. Maarten, Mexico, Indonesia, Ireland, Turkey, and St. Vincent.\n\nTrump claimed no charitable deductions in 2020\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump pledged he would donate the entirety of his $400,000 salary to charity each year. He frequently boasted about donating parts of his quarterly paycheck to various government agencies.\n\n“While the press doesn’t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year,” Trump tweeted in March 2019.\n\nIf he donated his 2020 salary, he didn’t claim it on his taxes. Among the six years of tax returns the House Ways and Means Committee released, 2020 was the sole year in which Trump listed no donations to charity.\n\nTrump’s finances took a sizable hit in 2020, probably as a result of the pandemic and the lack of demand for vacations and lodging in his hotels. Trump reported large donations to charity in 2018 and 2019, helping reduce the amount he owed on millions of dollars in income he reported in those years.\n\nBut Trump posted a massive $4.8 million adjusted loss in 2020, a year, which alone wiped out his federal income tax obligation. Trump paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2020.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation raised questions about the accuracy of some enormous charitable deductions Trump claimed in previous years’ tax returns, including large and unsubstantiated cash gifts. Trump also claimed a $21.1 million deduction in 2015 for donating 158 acres of his 212-acre property called Seven Springs in North Castle, New York. That donation, which was made to a land trust, is a focus of the Manhattan district attorney’s criminal investigation of the Trump Organization’s finances.\n\nTrump’s own 2017 tax law appears to have reduced the amount he was able to deduct from tax bill\n\nTrump claimed that the 2017 Republican tax plan he championed and signed would cost him and his family “a fortune.” It’s not clear that it did, but it does appear to have limited the amount that he could claim in one part of his complex tax return.\n\nThe 2017 tax law capped the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, at $10,000 a year. In previous years, tax filers were allowed to deduct more of their SALT payments. Although the law was passed in 2017, it didn’t apply until the 2018 tax year.\n\nIn 2018, Trump listed $10.5 million in state and local taxes, but could deduct just $10,000 of that from his taxes. In 2019, Trump paid $8.4 million in SALT but was capped at $10,000. And in 2020, Trump said he paid $8.5 million in SALT but claimed the maximum allowable $10,000.\n\nBy comparison, in 2016 and 2017, Trump was able to deduct significantly more from state and local taxes. For example, in 2016 and 2017, he deducted $5.2 million each year in SALT payments.\n\nSome Democrats criticized the 2017 tax law’s SALT cap for taking aim at residents in the Northeast and the West who have some of the highest property taxes in the country. The Tax Foundation found that property tax deductions capped in 2017 had previously accounted for about a third of all state and local tax deductions. But Trump defended the provision, saying the cap was necessary even if it would hurt his own finances.\n\nIt’s not clear how much the SALT cap hurt Trump, however. Although that particular deduction was capped, Trump claimed many other deductions that limited the amount of federal income taxes he had to pay.\n\nPresidential audits\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the IRS and writing tax policy, requested the returns under the authority of section 6103 of the US tax code. Their report focused primarily on whether Trump’s tax returns during his time in office were properly audited under the IRS’ mandatory audit program for US presidents.\n\nThe committee found that the IRS opened only one “mandatory” audit during Trump’s term – for his 2016 tax return. And that didn’t take place until the fall of 2019, after Chairman Richard Neal, a Massachusetts Democrat, first sent a letter asking the IRS for Trump’s returns and tax information. The report characterizes the presidential audit program as “dormant.”\n\n“The research that was done as it relates to the mandatory audit program was nonexistent,” Neal said last week following the committee vote.\n\nRepublicans on the committee argued that Democrats acknowledged it was “not necessary to publicly release the private tax information to change requirements on the presidential audit program.”\n\nA Republican dissent issued Friday warned that, “Democrats’ dangerous precedent will lead the American public to demand other people’s tax returns to be released.”\n\nLast week, the House passed a bill that would reform the presidential audit process in a largely symbolic vote before Republicans take the majority in the new Congress. The legislation is not expected to be taken up by the Senate before the new Congress is sworn in.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["David Goldman Jeremy Herb Jeanne Sahadi Maegan Vazquez", "David Goldman", "Jeremy Herb", "Jeanne Sahadi", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/", "title": "Exclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential ...", "text": "Nick Penzenstadler, and Susan Page\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is a fighter, famous for legal skirmishes over everything from his golf courses to his tax bills to Trump University. But until now, it hasn’t been clear precisely how litigious he is and what that might portend for a Trump presidency.\n\nAn exclusive USA TODAY analysis of legal filings across the United States finds that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and his businesses have been involved in at least 3,500 legal actions in federal and state courts during the past three decades. They range from skirmishes with casino patrons to million-dollar real estate suits to personal defamation lawsuits.\n\nThe sheer volume of lawsuits is unprecedented for a presidential nominee. No candidate of a major party has had anything approaching the number of Trump’s courtroom entanglements.\n\nJust since he announced his candidacy a year ago, at least 70 new cases have been filed, about evenly divided between lawsuits filed by him and his companies and those filed against them. And the records review found at least 50 civil lawsuits remain open even as he moves toward claiming the nomination at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in seven weeks. On Tuesday, court documents were released in one of the most dramatic current cases, filed in California by former students accusing Trump University of fraudulent and misleading behavior.\n\nThe legal actions provide clues to the leadership style the billionaire businessman would bring to bear as commander in chief. He sometimes responds to even small disputes with overwhelming legal force. He doesn’t hesitate to deploy his wealth and legal firepower against adversaries with limited resources, such as homeowners. He sometimes refuses to pay real estate brokers, lawyers and other vendors.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nAs he campaigns, Trump often touts his skills as a negotiator. The analysis shows that lawsuits are one of his primary negotiating tools. He turns to litigation to distance himself from failing projects that relied on the Trump brand to secure investments. As USA TODAY previously reported, he also uses the legal system to haggle over his property tax bills. His companies have been involved in more than 100 tax disputes, and the New York State Department of Finance has obtained liens on Trump properties for unpaid tax bills at least three dozen times.\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes, tied to Trump and his companies\n\nAnd despite his boasts on the campaign trail that he “never” settles lawsuits, for fear of encouraging more, he and his businesses have settled with plaintiffs in at least 100 cases reviewed by USA TODAY. Most involve people who say they were physically injured at Trump properties, with settlements that range as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nAlan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization, said in an interview that the number and tenor of the court cases is the “cost of doing business” and on par with other companies of a similar size. \"I think we have far less litigation of companies of our size,\" he said.\n\nHowever, even by those measures, the number of cases in which Trump is involved is extraordinary. For comparison, USA TODAY analyzed the legal involvement for five top real-estate business executives: Edward DeBartolo, shopping-center developer and former San Francisco 49ers owner; Donald Bren, Irvine Company chairman and owner; Stephen Ross, Time Warner Center developer; Sam Zell, Chicago real-estate magnate; and Larry Silverstein, a New York developer famous for his involvement in the World Trade Center properties.\n\nTo maintain an apples-to-apples comparison, only actions that used the developers' names were included. The analysis found Trump has been involved in more legal skirmishes than all five of the others — combined.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis included an examination of legal actions for and against Trump and the more than 500 businesses he lists on the personal financial disclosure he filed with the Federal Election Commission. USA TODAY also reviewed five depositions in which Trump sat for 22 hours of sworn testimony. This report is based on those legal filings as well as interviews with dozens of his legal adversaries.\n\nA handful of the ongoing cases involve local or state government entities, with the possibility of personal legal disputes between the president of the United States and other branches of government if Trump is elected. For instance, the Trump team has filed a lawsuit seeking a state ethics investigation of the New York attorney general. The suit was filed in response to an ongoing fraud investigation into Trump University by the attorney general, an elected state official.\n\nTrump, New York attorney general spar again over Trump U.\n\nAnd at a campaign rally in San Diego last Friday, Trump railed against a federal judge overseeing an ongoing lawsuit against Trump University. Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel \"happens to be, we believe Mexican,\" and called him a \"hater of Donald Trump\" who \"railroaded\" him. Born in Indiana, Curiel was appointed to the federal bench by President Obama. The judge on Tuesday unsealed hundreds of pages of documents in the case.\n\nThe trial is set for November — just after Election Day.\n\nTrump’s history of legal actions provides clues about his style as a leader and manager. While he is quick to take credit for anything associated with his name, he is just as quick to distance himself from failures and to place responsibility on others. In one lawsuit — filed against him by condo owners who wanted their money back for a Fort Lauderdale condo that was never built — he testified in a sworn deposition: “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers.”\n\nAt times, he and his companies refuse to pay even relatively small bills. An engineering firm and a law firm are among several who filed suits against Trump companies saying they weren't paid for their work. In a 2011 deposition tied to a dispute over his deal with Van Heusen menswear, he said he abruptly decided not to sign a check to a firm that helped broker the deal, after 11 consecutive quarterly payments, because \"I don't feel that these people did very much, if anything, with respect to this deal.”\n\nThe number of lawsuits raises questions about potential conflicts and complications if Trump does win the White House. Dozens of cases remain unresolved, about half in which he is the plaintiff. It raises the possibility of individuals being sued by the president of the United States, or suing him, in non-governmental disputes.\n\nUnder the law, Trump wouldn’t get special advantages as the plaintiff — or protections as a defendant. Under long-standing conflict-of-interest rules, as a plaintiff he couldn’t improperly benefit from governmental knowledge. He also wouldn’t get immunity from civil litigation that stemmed from events prior to taking office.\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK gathered Trump court files\n\nTogether, the lawsuits help address this question: How would Trump’s record in business translate into leading the most powerful government on the globe — a task that involves managing a $4 trillion annual budget, overseeing 1.8 million civilian federal employees and commanding the most powerful armed forces in the world?\n\nWhile leaders who had business careers sometimes have been elected to the White House — oilmen George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, for instance, and mining engineer Herbert Hoover — the jobs have some fundamental differences, political scientists and presidential historians say. A president can't rule by fiat, as some CEOs do. And getting things done in government often involves building coalitions among legislators and foreign leaders who have their own priorities and agendas.\n\n“He’s operating as his own boss and a CEO-on-steroids mentality, where you snap a finger and things get done,” said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who has written biographies of Franklin Roosevelt and Teddy Roosevelt and edited Ronald Reagan’s diaries. “But a lot of good governance is on learning how to build proper coalitions and how to have patience with the glacial pace of government, and you’re forced to abide by laws at all times. \"\n\nBrinkley sees \"a lot of warning signs about having someone of Trump’s temperament and professional disposition being the commander-in-chief.”\n\nTo be sure, likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has had her own legal challenges, including an ongoing FBI investigation and civil lawsuits into her exclusive use of an email server while secretary of State. When husband Bill Clinton was president, she was involved in investigations by special counsels looking into the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas and other controversies. None resulted in legal charges against her.\n\nDuring her time as first lady, U.S. senator from New York and secretary of State, Clinton has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mostly as a defendant, a review of state and federal court records finds. More than a third of the lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.\n\nThe USA TODAY analysis identified at least 3,500 legal actions involving Trump. Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of records collected electronically and in person from courts in 33 states over three months, read more than 20 hours of depositions and interviewed dozens of litigants.\n\nAmong those cases with a clear resolution, Trump's side was the apparent victor in 451 and the loser in 38. In about 500 cases, judges dismissed plaintiffs' claims against Trump. In hundreds more, cases ended with the available public record unclear about the resolution.\n\nClose to half the court cases — about 1,600 — involved lawsuits against gamblers who had credit at Trump-connected casinos and failed to pay their debts. About 100 additional disputes centered on other issues at the casinos. Trump and his enterprises have been named in almost 700 personal-injury claims and about 165 court disputes with government agencies.\n\nDozens dealt with the bankruptcy proceedings of Trump's companies, and dozens more involved plaintiffs' lawsuits against Trump businesses that judges terminated because the Trump companies targeted had gone bankrupt.\n\nThey include Trump's ongoing suit against the town of Palm Beach over airplane noise near his Mar-a-Lago Club and an earlier lawsuit against the town over an 80-foot flag pole. Trump's team argued in court that a smaller flag would understate his patriotism, but he eventually settled with town officials, agreeing among other concessions to lower the pole by 10 feet.\n\nThere also are disputes with local governments from New York to Florida to Nevada over the size of his property-tax bills.\n\nThe terms of most of the 100 settlements that Trump and his businesses reached with plaintiffs have not been disclosed. In about 60 additional cases, those sued by the Trump side have settled with him.\n\nA few have become fodder on the campaign trail, including two breach-of-contract lawsuits he filed against restaurateurs in connection with Trump's development of the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington. The businesses said they backed out of deals with Trump because of his derogatory comments about Mexicans. Both lawsuits are pending.\n\nThe luxury Trump hotel will have a prime view of the Inaugural Parade next January.\n\nReview of thousands of legal actions show that Trump is fiercely protective of his brand, quick to distance himself from deals that struggle, willing to deploy outsized resources against adversaries and sometimes prone to micro-management, even in disputes that involve relatively small amounts of money. Those approaches, however appropriate in a business setting, may not translate to a political one, especially at the level of the White House.\n\nAmong the details:\n\n• Trump distances himself from deals that sour.\n\nWhen projects struggle, Trump doesn’t hesitate to cut ties, even those that relied on his name to secure investments. That was the case in condo projects that were never completed in Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, Panama and Baja, Mexico.\n\nCondo buyers who sued to get their deposits back often said they believed Trump was a full partner in the buildings. Trump was shielded by disclaimers in sales agreements explaining his branding-only role, though plaintiffs and their lawyers argued in court that fine print didn’t sync with marketing materials that made it appear these were Trump properties.\n\nIn depositions and court filings in the condo cases and similar branding deals, Trump's team appears to try to have it both ways in depicting his involvement. On one hand, Trump contends deep influence over even the smallest details to ensure Trump-branded products and developments are up to his standard, and he places high importance on the influence of his marketing muscle in such deals — usually as the lead name, face and voice behind a project.\n\nOn the other hand, his team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name.\n\nTrump himself walked lawyers through the difference between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases.\n\n“Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under. “We worked on the documents, we worked on the room sizes and the things, but we didn't give out the contracts, we didn't get the financing, we weren't the developer, but we did work with the developer.”\n\nIn lawsuits over his Trump University, he testified that he had never met instructors who were described in the university’s promotional materials as being “handpicked” by him. “It depends on the definition of what that means, handpicked,” Trump said during an exchange with a lawyer in a sworn deposition last December.\n\nWhen attorneys representing plaintiffs pointed out some instructors had criminal pasts and had been accused of berating seniors who signed up for the program, Trump replied: “In every business, people slip through the cracks.”\n\nFlorida attorney Sherri Simpson, who defends homeowners in foreclosure actions, said she signed up for Trump University classes because she hoped to capitalize on low prices during the housing downturn. She wanted to turn to a trusted real-estate name to learn how.\n\n“I’m aggravated that I lost all that money,” she said in an interview. “He promised to hire the best, to handpick the instructors, make sure everyone affiliated with the program was the best. But he didn’t do that.”\n\n• Trump is willing to spend large sums on small claims.\n\nNo detail is too small for a Trump suit, and he often brings to bear overwhelming legal resources that enable him to outlast his adversaries.\n\nIn February, he filed five lawsuits against eight neighbors of his Doral golf club in Miami for $15,000 in damages to reimburse him for \"vandalizing\" or \"destroying\" expensive areca palms and other plants his groundskeepers installed between their homes and the course. Trump's staff says the foliage was planted to block golfers' views of the houses; the homeowners say the trees blocked their views of the course. All five cases are pending.\n\n“No other developer put so many resources in trying to fight claims brought by the plaintiffs,” said Jared Beck, a Miami attorney who has represented dozens of clients in lawsuits against developers in South Florida. He said none has fought with the tenacity of Trump, citing a “mismatch of resources” that often works in Trump’s favor.\n\nBeck is now appealing to the Florida Supreme Court a case that dates to 2008 in which he represented a group of people who invested in condos in a failed development in Fort Lauderdale to which Trump licensed his name. “He is willing to go to the mat and has practically unlimited resources.”\n\n• Trump fiercely protects the monetary value of “Trump” as a brand name.\n\nTrump publicly has placed the value of his licensed real estate and other branding deals at $3.3 billion, though Forbes and other analysts question whether the figure is inflated. His moniker drives the value of his licensing deals, which now make up an important arm of his business model.\n\nIn one case, a South Florida developer hired experts who testified that having Trump's name attached to their proposed condominium development boosted the condos' value by at least $200 per square foot. The swanky seaside complex was only partially built, prompting some condo buyers to file a lawsuit against Trump and the developers seeking to recover their deposits. The developers had paid to license Trump’s brand, allowing them to use Trump’s name, his image and his reputation to help them sell units.\n\nTrump has attempted to pull out or distance himself from similar licensing deals, real estate and otherwise, if he feels the situation is hurting his brand. He also goes to court to collect royalties and other fees he says he's owed on those same kinds of deals.\n\n“Anything I put my name to is very important,” Trump said in a 2010 deposition tied to a failed real-estate development in Tampa licensed to carry Trump’s “mark,\" as he calls it. \"If I allow my name to be used, whether it’s a partnership or whether it is a licensing deal, they are all very important to me.”\n\nTrump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.\n\nAnd he has been aggressive in suing unrelated companies that were using his name without permission. He won rulings over attempts to market Trump’s Best Coffee, a series of websites with names like trumpabudhabi.com and trumpbeijing.com, and a marketing agency calling itself Trump Your Competition.\n\nTrump’s general counsel, Garten, defended the number of lawsuits. “Our philosophy is that we are a company of principle,” he said. “When we believe we are in the right, we are going to pursue the matter to the end. If that requires that we go to trial and present evidence to a jury, we are prepared to do so. We are not going to cave to pressure.”\n\nBut experts in the presidency and business say Trump’s record, including in courtroom disputes, raise questions about whether he has exhibited the leadership qualities that have distinguished the nation’s most successful presidents.\n\n“Somebody like Lyndon Johnson was a guy who woke up in the morning studying the decisions and the hopes and the strengths and the weaknesses of all the people he had to influence,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and author of Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time. “For that, you need two traits I think Trump lacks: Number one, an attention to detail, and number two, you have to subordinate your own ego. I’ve seen nothing from Trump that suggests he has that capacity, and government is the art of compromise.”\n\nTrump’s lack of government experience was a political advantage during the GOP primaries, reinforcing his status as an outsider vowing to shake up a dysfunctional Washington. But it threatens to be a liability in the general election. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released last week, six in 10 voters said they had reservations about or were uncomfortable with Trump’s lack of experience in government or the military.\n\nEven so, some of those who have sued Trump, been sued by him or otherwise been caught up in his legal wake, say they still may vote for him in November.\n\nPhilip Monnin represented his daughter, Miss Pennsylvania contestant Sheena Monnin, in a defamation suit Trump filed after she posted on Facebook that she thought the 2012 Miss USA Pageant was “rigged.” An arbitration ruling upheld by a federal judge ordered her to pay $5 million in damages, although she and Trump eventually settled out of court for an undisclosed lesser amount. Monnin, who lives in Michigan, said the suit demonstrated Trump’s bullying tactics and attempts to intimidate legal opponents.\n\nBut he doesn’t rule out voting for Trump for president. “Both sides have failed to bring satisfactory candidates,” he said in an interview. “I don’t think any of us in the family has decided what to do, and we have a lot of time to consider how to cast our votes.”\n\nContributing: David McKay Wilson, Karen Yi, John Kelly and Kevin McCoy\n\nExclusive: Trump's 3,500 lawsuits unprecedented for a presidential nominee\n\nUSA TODAY exclusive: Hundreds allege Donald Trump doesn't pay his bills\n\nTrump, companies accused of mistreating women in at least 20 lawsuits\n\nExclusive: More than 100 lawsuits, disputes over taxes tied to Trump and his companies\n\nDive into Donald Trump's thousands of lawsuits\n\nTrump casino empire dogged by bad bets in Atlantic City\n\nAs campaign rolls on, so do Trump's lawsuits in Florida\n\nHow USA TODAY NETWORK is tracking Trump court files\n\nTrump and the Law", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/21/voters-split-donald-trump-colorado-2024-ballot/71983206007/", "title": "Voters split after Donald Trump was removed from Colorado 2024 ...", "text": "CONCORD, N.H. – When it comes to politics, what happens in Colorado doesn't stay in Colorado.\n\nA blockbuster decision in that state this week to keep Donald Trump off the GOP presidential ballot could have reverberations in political battles around the country.\n\nFights are already popping up in other areas to replicate or prevent decisions that would disqualify Trump from the ballot in other states. Some Republicans have floated trying to remove President Joe Biden from ballots.\n\nAt the heart of the brewing conflicts is a question: Should courts or voters decide if a candidate is disqualified for the presidency?\n\nDavid Scanlan, the Republican secretary of state in New Hampshire, answered that question in September when he decided not to block Trump from the ballot.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nScanlan told USA TODAY on Wednesday he still feels a decision about whether Trump is eligible to run should come after the primary season is over.\n\n“If they find that Trump can't be on the ballot, then to me that should be dealt with either at the convention or shortly after the convention, not in the middle of the nominating process,\" he said.\n\nVoters in New Hampshire and across the country are also weighing in, and their views reflect a polarized nation ahead of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nRepublican voters in nearly every region of the U.S. told USA TODAY they're skeptical about the court’s decision and questioned its authority to rule whether the former president engaged in an insurrection. Meanwhile, Democratic voters argued the Colorado high court was simply abiding by its duty to enforce the Constitution.\n\nThe court, divided 4-3, held that Trump played a role in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, and is prevented by the 14th Amendment from holding office.\n\nHere’s a look at how voters across the country responded to the unprecedented Colorado Supreme Court decision:\n\n‘Innocent until found guilty’: Voters say Colorado was too quick to judge\n\nVoters in other states agree with Scanlan, including Scott Hunter, a 61-year-old senior lecturer at The Ohio State University. Hunter said that, while he doesn't usually support Trump, he sees the Colorado Supreme Court's decision as premature.\n\n“At this point in time, he's been indicted on a lot of things. But he hasn't been convicted of anything yet,” said Hunter, who lives in Powell, Ohio.\n\n“Not enough is known yet about what he did and what he didn't do,” he added. “It's quite really divisive, and I think it's really a poor choice on the part of Colorado.”\n\nAlexander Eli, a 36-year-old from Minneapolis, similarly told USA TODAY he sees the Colorado ruling as a “waste of time.”\n\n“He hasn't been charged with anything formally yet,” Eli said. “In the U.S., people should be considered innocent until found guilty in a court of law.”\n\nEli, who works in logistics at a trucking company, voted for Trump in 2016. He did not support Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n“I’d be happy to have him removed from the election,” Eli said. “But the law should rule the country, not politics.”\n\nJohn Murray, 62, agreed that Trump shouldn't be booted from the ballot until he's actually convicted of the felonies he faces. The decision instead, he said, should go to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n“You have something that has national import,” Murray, a clinical and sports psychologist from Palm Beach, Florida, said. “It would be a mess if fifteen other states decided to take it on their own, to make decisions of such importance.”\n\nMurray said he will likely vote for the former president in the primary and general elections. If the U.S. Supreme Court does uphold the Colorado court’s ruling, though, the former independent and now Republican said he would accept their decision.\n\n“I don't want it to happen because it just seems so unruly, seems like it would just create more chaos,” he said. “But let the highest court in the land speak.”\n\nVoters brush off decision’s impact in early voting states\n\nTrump is leading in New Hampshire by a wide margin, but the race could tighten as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley gains momentum. The Colorado case, however, isn’t playing a major role in how the state’s key voters are approaching the ballot box.\n\nMany people holiday shopping in the state’s capital Wednesday said they hadn’t heard about the ruling.\n\nChris Jackson, a 74-year-old undeclared voter, said he believed the Colorado Supreme Court was \"probably doing the American voters a favor” with its decision.\n\n\"Regardless of whether (Trump) wins or whether he loses, how would the United States look if they actually elected somebody to the presidency, who was also later to be found guilty of a felony,\" the software engineer from Hudson, New Hampshire, said.\n\nTrump is facing four sets of criminal charges in both state and federal courts.\n\nJackson suspected most Granite State voters have already made up their minds ahead of 2024. What might sway locals, however, is whether the Supreme Court weighs in and makes history in the election.\n\n\"None of it means anything until it goes to the Supreme Court,\" Jackson, who plans to vote for Biden, said.\n\nSeveral Granite State Republicans told USA TODAY they're disappointed in the western state’s judicial system, accusing the Colorado court of making a political move instead of a legal one. Not all fans of the former president, these voters said they don’t believe the courts have the right to prevent Trump from being on the ballot unless he is convicted of participating in an insurrection.\n\nTrump has been twice indicted over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including a federal case and a case focused on his actions in Georgia.\n\nCourt ruling reveals tensions between Democrats and Republicans heading into 2024\n\nThe Colorado ruling is sure to have a ripple effect across the country, but that impact won't include bringing voters together from across the aisle.\n\nFor example, Alex Berthelot, a 23-year-old from Metairie, Louisiana, called the ruling “absolutely asinine.”\n\n“Coming from a person in Louisiana, I feel like my vote is now being just taken for granted. It's very disheartening,” Berthelot, a registered Republican, said.\n\n“I mean, I'm still going to get to cast my vote here,” he added. “But I was kind of shocked that one person could just be stricken off the ballot in one state.”\n\nMolly Tanzer, a 42-year-old sci-fi author and longtime Democratic voter in Colorado, told USA TODAY \"I would love for us to start a tsunami of (Trump) being kicked off\" ballots. But she believes the former president \"has a way of getting around things, so I have a hard time surrendering to the idea it will actually happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tom Klapproth, a 70-year-old retired carpenter, agreed with the Colorado State Supreme Court decision.\n\nA Democrat from Chichester, New Hampshire, Klapproth argued it's a court's duty to rule whether Trump should be on the ballot, given the case's tie to the 14th Amendment.\n\n“The democratic institutions of this country are just too fragile to be messed with,” he told USA TODAY, while walking around the grounds of the New Hampshire State Capitol.\n\nKlapproth, who plans to vote for Biden in the upcoming primary, pointed to a statue of former President Franklin Pierce featuring a quote that read: “He was a gentleman and a man of courage.”\n\n“Look at these guys, these statues, they were true leaders,” he said. “I don’t see that anymore.”\n\nContributing: Trevor Hughes, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/politics/jan-6-committee-final-report/index.html", "title": "January 6 committee releases final report, says Trump should be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection recommends barring former President Donald Trump from holding office again.\n\nThe recommendation is among the conclusions of the panel’s final report, a comprehensive overview of the bipartisan panel’s findings on how Trump and his allies sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election, released late Thursday evening.\n\nThe 845-page report – based on 1,000-plus interviews, documents collected including emails, texts, phone records and a year and a half of investigation – includes allegations that Trump “oversaw” the legally dubious effort to put forward fake slates of electors in seven states he lost, arguing that the evidence shows he actively worked to “transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives” despite concerns among his lawyers that doing so could be unlawful.\n\nIn a symbolic move Monday, the committee in its last public meeting referred Trump to the Justice Department on at least four criminal charges, while saying in its executive summary it had evidence of possible charges of conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\n“That evidence has led to an overriding and straight forward conclusion: the central cause of January 6th was one man, former President Donald Trump, whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6th would have happened without him,” the report states.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said on Monday that he has “every confidence that the work of this committee will help provide a road map to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid in their work.”\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith is leading the Justice Department’s investigations related to Trump, including both his post-election actions and classified documents found at his Mar-a-Lago resort earlier this year.\n\nTrump swiftly lashed out over the report on his Truth Social platform with false claims about the riot and the 2020 election. He did not address specific findings from what he called the “highly partisan” report but instead falsely blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the breakdown in security that day and resurfaced his unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\nHere’s what’s in the report:\n\nTrump and his inner circle engaged in ‘at least 200’ attempts to pressure state officials\n\nIn an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle targeted election officials in “at least 200 apparent acts of public or private outreach, pressure, or condemnation,” between Election Day and the January 6 attack, according to the report.\n\nThere were 68 meetings, attempted or connected phone calls, or text messages, aimed at state or local officials, as well as 125 social media posts by Trump or senior aides targeting state officials.\n\nTrump “spearheaded outreach aimed at numerous officials in States he lost but that had GOP-led legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona,” the report says. (He lost all of those states.)\n\nFor example, during a January 2, 2021, call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the then-president went through a “litany of false election-fraud claims” and then asked Raffensperger to deliver him a second term by “finding” just enough votes to ensure victory, according to the report.\n\nTrump infamously said, “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state.”\n\nCommittee identifies pro-Trump lawyer Kenneth Chesebro as architect of fake electors plot\n\nThe January 6 committee identifies a little known pro-Trump attorney as being the original architect of the legally dubious fake electors plan: Kenneth Chesebro.\n\nConservative attorney John Eastman authored a now-infamous memo detailing step-for-step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could theoretically overturn the 2020 election results. But the committee points to Chesebro, a known associate of Eastman, as being responsible for creating the fake electors plot.\n\n“The fake elector plan emerged from a series of legal memoranda written by an outside legal advisor to the Trump Campaign: Kenneth Chesebro,” the report says.\n\nIt was previously known that Chesebro was involved in the fake electors scheme, but the committee’s conclusion about his leadership role is new.\n\nThe effort to put forward fake slates of pro-Trump electors is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020.\n\nThe committee wrote that Chesebro sent a memo to then-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani after a request from Trump campaign official Boris Epshteyn about a “‘President of the Senate’ strategy,” which wrongly asserted that the vice president could pick which presidential electors to count during the joint session of Congress on January 6.\n\n“President Trump in the days immediately before January 6th, Chesebro – an attorney based in Boston and New York recruited to assist the Trump Campaign as a volunteer legal advisor – was central to the creation of the plan,” the report says. “Memos by Chesebro on November 18th, December 9th, and December 13th, as discussed below, laid the plan’s foundation.”\n\nCNN has previously asked Chesebro to comment about these topics and he has not responded.\n\nTrump WH called Eastman on the day he wrote his memo\n\nEastman reached out to speak to Trump on December 23, 2020, the same day that he drafted his initial memo on the Pence theory.\n\nEastman emailed Trump’s assistant, Molly Michael, at 1:32 p.m., according to the committee. “Is the President available for a very quick call today at some point? Just want to update him on our overall strategic thinking.”\n\nThe committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switchboard, and the call lasted 23 minutes, according to Eastman’s phone records. Eastman’s two-page memo discussed various ways to ensure “President Trump is re-elected,” even though by then, he had been projected to lose the election, according to the committee.\n\nThese new details show how the committee used emails and phone records it obtained after it successfully fought in court to obtain the documents.\n\nThe committee obtained Eastman’s emails after a judge sided with the House in a lawsuit where the committee accused both Eastman and Trump of a criminal conspiracy to obstruct Congress and to defraud the government.\n\nTrump latched onto Eastman’s theories that incorrectly claimed Pence could overturn the election, and launched a pressure campaign against Pence in the days leading up to January 6. Eastman was present at a January 4, 2021, meeting between Trump and Pence in the Oval Office where Trump tried to convince Pence he could intervene when Congress certified the Electoral College vote on January 6.\n\nJanuary 6 committee recommends barring Trump from holding office again\n\nBarring Trump from further public office is one of 11 recommendations the committee is making as a result of its investigation.\n\nThe panel zeroes in on the section of the Constitution that states an individual who has taken an oath to support the US Constitution but has “engaged in an insurrection” or given “aid or comfort to the enemies of the Constitution” can be disqualified from office. The former president and others have been referred by the committee to the Department of Justice for assisting or aiding an insurrection.\n\nIt calls on congressional committees of jurisdiction to create a “formal mechanism” for evaluating whether those individuals violate that section of the 14th Amendment should be barred from future federal or state office.\n\nSays lawyers should be held responsible\n\nIn addition to criminal referrals, the select committee is calling for lawyers involved in the efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.\n\n“Those courts and bar disciplinary bodies responsible for overseeing the legal profession in the states and the District of Columbia should continue to evaluate the conduct of attorneys described in this Report” the panel writes, adding that there are specific attorneys the report identifies as having “conflicts of interests” for the Department of Justice to evaluate.\n\nThe report even calls on Congress to amend statutes and consider the severity of penalties that deter individuals from efforts to obstruct, influence or impede the Joint Session of Congress that certifies election results. It calls for statutes of federal penalties for certain types of threats against election workers to be strengthened.\n\nAlthough the panel was successful in getting more than 1,000 witnesses to testify as part of its investigation, it still had difficulty gaining cooperation from everyone it wanted to speak to. Its report recommends congressional committees of jurisdiction “develop legislation” to create “a cause of action” for the House to enforce its subpoenas in federal court.\n\nElectoral Count Act reform\n\nOne recommendation may soon become reality.\n\nThe panel calls on Congress to pass an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the insurrection and Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power.\n\nThe House and Senate have each passed their own version of the legislation.\n\nCommittee refers Trump to Justice Department\n\nA video of former President Donald Trump is shown on a screen on Capitol Hill on December 19, 2022. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nThe House committee lays out a number of criminal statutes it believes were violated in the plots to stave off Trump’s defeat and says there’s evidence for criminal referrals to the Justice Department for Trump, Eastman and “others.”\n\nThe report summary first released Monday says there’s evidence to pursue Trump on multiple crimes, including obstruction of an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to make false statements, assisting or aiding an insurrection, conspiring to injure or impede an officer and seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe panel says it also has the evidence to refer Eastman on the obstruction charge, and it names him as a co-conspirator in other alleged criminal activity lawmakers have gathered evidence on.\n\nThe committee alluded to evidence of criminal obstruction of the House investigation but the summary does not go into detail about that evidence.\n\nTrump’s false victory declaration was ‘premeditated’\n\nThe committee outlines 17 findings from its investigation that underpin its reasoning for criminal referrals, including that Trump knew the fraud allegations he was pushing were false and continued to amplify them anyway.\n\n“President Trump’s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated,” the report states.\n\nThe committee also revealed emails from Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch, from before the 2020 presidential election that say Trump should declare victory regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt notes that Trump’s top allies, including those who testified before the committee, acknowledged they found no proof to back up the former president’s claims.\n\n“Ultimately, even Rudolph Giuliani and his legal team acknowledged that they had no definitive evidence of election fraud sufficient to change the election outcome,” it adds, referring to Trump’s then-personal attorney.\n\n“For example, although Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election, he admitted during his Select Committee deposition that ‘I do not think the machines stole the election,’” it states.\n\nMillions of dollars were raised on false claims, but RNC showed caution to not go too far\n\nThe committee investigators describe how Trump campaign and Republican National Committee fundraising pitches containing false claims of a stolen election ultimately raised more than $250 million – but were met internally with some resistance.\n\nInvestigators describe three options that were considered for a post-election fundraising appeal by the campaign. One option, that the campaign opted against using because they knew it was false, said that Trump had won. A second unused option said the campaign was waiting on results. Ultimately, according to the committee, the Trump campaign approved a message that Democrats are going to “try to steal the election” that was written before election night.\n\nThe committee describes, based on interview with Trump campaign officials, that much of the material in the fundraising emails was based on messages said by Trump – but were not checked for accuracy before being used to ask for donations.\n\n“President Trump’s claims were treated as true and blasted to millions of people with little to no scrutiny by those tasked with ensuring accuracy,” the committee wrote.\n\nTrump campaign’s deputy director of communications and research Zach Parkinson told investigators that reviews for accuracy were limited to “questions concerning items such as time and location.”\n\nThe RNC did eventually tone down some messages, which the committee suggests shows “the RNC knew that President’s Trump’s claims about winning the election were baseless” and made “changes to fundraising copy that seemingly protected the RNC from legal exposure,” according to investigators.\n\nHouse investigators said that RNC lawyers directed copywriters not to use the term “rigged,” according to interviews conducted by the committee. The panel obtained several examples of fundraising appeals that were toned down to be accurate and less inflammatory.\n\nTrump privately called some of Sidney Powell’s election claims ‘crazy’\n\nWhite House communications director Hope Hicks told the January 6 committee that Donald Trump had laughed at one of his election lawyer’s claims about foreign powers interfering in the election, calling them “crazy,” according to the committee’s final report.\n\n“The day after the press conference, President Trump spoke by phone with Sidney Powell from the Oval Office. During the call, Powell repeated the same claims of foreign interference in the election she had made at the press conference,” the report said, referring to conspiratorial claims made by Powell, Trump’s onetime attorney, at an outlandish press conference after the 2020 election.\n\n“While she was speaking, the President muted his speakerphone and laughed at Powell, telling the others in the room, ‘This does sound crazy, doesn’t it?’” the report says.\n\nDuring the press conference, Powell falsely claimed, among other things, that widely used voting machines from the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems featured software created “at the direction” of deceased Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to swing his own election results, and that the company has ties to the Clinton Foundation and George Soros.\n\n“A few days later, the Trump campaign issued a statement claiming Powell was not part of the Trump campaign’s legal team. But Powell’s outlandish claims were no different from those President Trump was making himself,” the committee writes.\n\nTrump refused to act as riot unfolded\n\nPro-Trump supporters storm the US Capitol following a rally with President Donald Trump on January 6, 2021 in Washington. Samuel Corum/Getty Images/FILE\n\nThe committee lays out Trump’s failure to act as the riot unfolded, noting that as he watched the riot on television, he made no calls for security assistance and resisted efforts from staffers asking him to call off his supporters.\n\n“President Trump did not contact a single top national security official during the day. Not at the Pentagon, nor at the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the F.B.I., the Capitol Police Department, or the D.C. Mayor’s office,” the committee writes. “As Vice President Pence has confirmed, President Trump didn’t even try to reach his own Vice President to make sure that Pence was safe.”\n\nMilley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the committee he had this reaction to Trump, “You know, you’re the Commander in Chief. You’ve got an assault going on on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there’s nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?”\n\nWhite House staffers, meantime, described being appalled that as the Capitol was under attack, Trump fired off a tweet criticizing Pence.\n\nHicks texted a colleague that night to say, “Attacking the VP? Wtf is wrong with him,” according to the committee’s summary report.\n\n“No photographs exist of the President for the remainder of the afternoon until after 4 p.m. President Trump appears to have instructed that the White House photographer was not to take any photographs,” the committee writes, citing testimony from former White House photographer Shealah Craighead.\n\nIn the aftermath, on the evening of January 6, Trump’s former campaign manager Brad Parscale told Katrina Pierson, one of the rally organizers, that he felt guilty helping Trump win, the report states.\n\nThe events of the day, Parscale said, resulted from “a sitting president asking for civil war.”\n\nAide characterized Trump’s tone on January 6 as, ‘can you believe this sh*t?’\n\nTrump’s tone during his last known phone call on January 6 was like, “wow, can you believe this sh*t?” according to the White House aide who spoke with him that night.\n\nIn newly revealed testimony included in the January 6 committee’s final report, the aide, John McEntee, said Trump told him “[t]his is a crazy day.” The report added, “McEntee said his tone was one of “like, wow, can you believe this sh*t?”\n\nTrump did not express any sadness over the violence that had unfolded at the Capitol that day, McEntee told the panel.\n\n“I think he was shocked by, you know, it getting a little out of control, but I don’t remember sadness, specifically” McEntee said.\n\nHe wasn’t the only person with that impression about Trump’s mood.\n\nIvanka Trump, a senior White House adviser at the time, told the select committee her father was “disappointed and surprised” by the attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut when pressed by committee investigators, she could not provide any instances of the president discussing whether or not he did the right thing on January 6 or speaking about those who were injured or died that day.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Annie Grayer Jeremy Herb Tierney Sneed Devan Cole Geneva Sands Katelyn Polantz Hannah Rabinowitz", "Zachary Cohen", "Annie Grayer", "Jeremy Herb", "Tierney Sneed", "Devan Cole", "Geneva Sands", "Katelyn Polantz", "Hannah Rabinowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/10/30/courts-reject-voting-rights-extensions-in-covid-shadowed-elections/5998149002/", "title": "Election results for Biden, Trump could be decided by these lawsuits", "text": "In Alabama, a Black man with Parkinson's disease and asthma asked a court to allow curbside voting but was turned down by the U.S. Supreme Court. In Florida, 700,000 felons trying to regain their right to vote were hampered by five judges appointed by President Donald Trump. In Arkansas, three judges appointed by Republican presidents told elderly residents worried about COVID-19 exposure they could sign ballot initiatives through a window.\n\nAt the same time, arguments from Trump's lawyers have been shot down in several states, and the president was dealt two setbacks by the Supreme Court just before Election Day in cases that expanded absentee voting – a procedure he has criticized without evidence as the source of ballot fraud.\n\nThose outcomes are part of a record-setting number of lawsuits that have been filed this year, with even more expected to come after polls close Tuesday. In all, more than 230 election-related federal lawsuits were filed from Jan. 1 to Oct. 23, higher than any of the past three presidential election years during the same time period, a USA TODAY analysis of federal court data found.\n\nThe outcomes have been mixed. Voting rights advocates won numerous COVID-19-related decisions that expanded access to absentee ballots, extended deadlines to count those ballots and allowed blind and disabled voters to cast their ballots electronically or by phone. Trump’s lawyers and his supporters have also scored key victories, locking in Election Day deadlines for absentee voting, limiting the number of ballot drop boxes and blocking other measures to ease voting.\n\nThe flood of litigation has been powered by the coronavirus pandemic that forced states to adjust their normal voting protocols.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nLawyers representing Trump, the Republican Party and conservative voters have warned – with little evidence – of voter fraud as they’ve urged courts to limit voter registration efforts, block universal mail-in voting and other pandemic-related changes.\n\n\"The electoral process cannot function properly if it lacks integrity and results in chaos,\" Trump’s attorneys wrote in a Nevada lawsuit.\n\nSupporters of Democratic nominee Joe Biden, the Democratic Party, civil rights groups and organizations representing vulnerable communities have fought back.

USA TODAY also reviewed election lawsuit data compiled and maintained by the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project and the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThe analysis found that Trump has already been assisted by the legions of federal court judges he appointed during his first term in office. Working with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the conservative Federalist Society legal group, the president has installed more than a quarter of all federal judges.\n\nThe Supreme Court has played a significant role in election-related cases, issuing a series of decisions halting lower-court rulings that would have expanded voting access. This week’s confirmation of Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett, Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee, further cemented the court’s 6-3 conservative majority, giving Trump and Republicans an even more significant advantage heading into what is expected to be a post-Election Day legal frenzy.\n\n\"We saw a wave of judges ... issuing very careful rulings protecting voting rights and carefully crafting remedies so people can vote safely during the pandemic, and the Supreme Court issued rulings that just swept them away without any explanation,\" said Wendy Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan think tank based in New York.\n\nThe lawsuits are a culmination of a decades-long trend that started with the infamous Florida recount in the 2000 presidential election. The contest was ultimately decided by the Supreme Court, a ruling that has resulted in a steady increase of election-related lawsuits ever since. Richard Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who has tracked election-related lawsuits for three decades, said the 2018 midterm elections had set the latest record for election year lawsuits, but 2020 is on pace to set a new mark.\n\nAt times, the hyperpoliticized nature of the 2020 election cycle has contributed to lawsuits that often sound like an angry Twitter feed.\n\nIn Michigan, a Republican state candidate argued in court documents that sending absentee ballot requests to all voters would only help \"the deep state.\" In Illinois, a county Republican Party accused the state's Democratic governor of implementing an emergency election system designed to minimize Republican ballots and \"if the election still doesn’t turn out the way he wants it, to generate enough Democratic ballots after election day to sway the result.\"\n\nLawsuits initiated by Democrats and advocacy groups have accused Republican election officials of purposefully curtailing the vote for constituencies that don't support them. In Minnesota, several groups challenged a state law requiring a witness to sign absentee ballots, which they claim is discriminatory to African and Native Americans who tend to suffer from higher rates of preexisting conditions that make their communities more vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nBelow is a look at the legal landscape across the nation. A handful of states, including Hawaii and Wyoming, avoided significant legal battles and are not listed.\n\nAlabama\n\nVoters worried about exposing themselves to COVID-19 inside polling stations won a legal victory this summer when a judge ordered the state to make it easier to vote by mail and allow curbside voting.\n\nThat was a relief for the plaintiffs, including Howard Porter, a 70-year-old African American who has Parkinson's disease and asthma. He argued in court papers that he hadn't left his home since the pandemic started but can't vote absentee because the state requires a witness sign all absentee ballots, and Porter worries about exposing himself in that way.\n\n\"(So) many of my (ancestors) even died to vote,\" Porter said during a hearing. \"And while I don’t mind dying to vote, I think we’re past … that time.\"\n\nIn the wake of the ruling, election officials in Jefferson and Montgomery counties – home to the state's two largest cities, which both voted against Trump during the 2016 election – announced they would adopt curbside voting in time for November.\n\nAll those plans ended, however, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the Alabama judge's ruling on Oct. 21 without explanation. In a dissenting opinion, Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor lamented the high court's decision, pointing out that even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended curbside voting to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe counties \"are ready and willing to help vulnerable voters like Mr. Porter cast their ballots without unnecessarily risking infection from a deadly virus,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"This Court should not stand in their way.\"\n\nAlaska\n\nAn Alaskan tribe sued the state government over a rule that required witness signatures on absentee ballots.\n\nResidents of Arctic Village, a tiny Native American community of 150 members deep in the mountains in northern Alaska, went into a severe lockdown after some members contracted COVID-19 and returned to the village. Leaders closed down the village to all outsiders and issued strict orders that people not congregate with anybody outside their household.\n\n\"The Tribe is aware that COVID-19-related deaths among Native communities is highest among any demographic group in the United States,\" its lawyers wrote. \"The Tribe has taken a series of drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus that, if not contained, has the potential to decimate the Arctic Village's entire population.\"\n\nState election leaders in this Republican-controlled state argued that the village made its request too late – the lawsuit was filed in September – and that it would create too much confusion for voters to alter absentee ballot rules so close to the November election. The judge disagreed, arguing that the state could easily send out public notices of the change and that the health of Alaskans was more important than any last-minute inconveniences to the state.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Dani Crosby, who called the pandemic \"a shifty beast,\" sided with the tribe, concluding that absentee ballots could risk the lives of voters and ordering the state to accept absentee ballots without a witness signature.\n\nArizona\n\nPerhaps no other state has seen more judicial rulings limiting voting rights than Arizona, a Republican-leaning state that has emerged as a possible win for Biden this year.\n\nIn one case, two advocacy groups persuaded a federal judge to extend the state's Oct. 3 voter registration deadline by nearly three weeks because of COVID-19 delays. But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down that ruling, ordering that voter registrations be shut down on Oct. 15. More than 7,000 voters registered during the extension period.\n\nThe appeals court struck down another ruling that would have allowed voters who accidentally mailed their absentee ballots without signing them an opportunity to fix the error up to five days after Election Day. The deadline is now Election Day.\n\nOne judge ruled that members of the Navajo Nation do not face unfair barriers to voting and struck down their request to extend the deadline to submit their absentee ballots. And another judge denied a request to waive the state's requirement that a witness be present when signing ballot initiatives, despite claims that the requirement puts medically compromised Arizonans at risk of exposing themselves to the coronavirus.\n\nOne of the rare legal victories for voting rights advocates came in Maricopa County, where Superior Court Judge Randall Warner allowed vulnerable voters to fill out their ballots by placing a video call to a county election official who fills out their ballot. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey objected to that practice, but Warner ruled that it was legal and necessary to protect disabled people and those in hospitals or nursing homes.\n\n\"Federal law does not allow Arizona to impose on a disabled voter the choice between voting and protecting their health,\" Warner wrote.\n\nArkansas\n\nArkansas voters have been shot down by federal judges in every attempt to expand their ability to vote in elections throughout 2020.\n\nOne federal judge struck down a request from voters to extend absentee ballot deadlines for the state’s May primary, arguing that Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson had already done enough when he loosened rules to secure a ballot.\n\nIn another case, a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a lower court ruling that would have eliminated the state’s requirement that all signatures gathered to get citizen petitions on the November ballot be witnessed and notarized. The lawsuit argues that such close contact exposes voters who are disabled, vulnerable to COVID-19 or living in nursing homes unable to sign those ballot initiatives without risking their lives.\n\nThe three appellate court judges – all appointed by Republican presidents – ruled that those voters could find creative ways to sign a ballot initiative without risking their health. In their opinion, the judges wrote that voters could be given \"sterilized petitions\" or sign them \"through a window from the safety of their homes.\"\n\n\"No doubt, the in-person signature requirement imposes real burdens,\" the judges wrote. \"We are just not persuaded it imposes severe burdens.\"\n\nThe League of Women Voters was also rejected when it filed a lawsuit requesting that voters whose signatures are deemed invalid are notified and given a chance to correct it. The organization argued that many factors may contribute to people signing their name differently on their ballot from the signature on file with the state.\n\n\"The rate of error only increases when signature matching is left to laypersons who have not received training in forensic document examination,\" the organization argued in its lawsuit.\n\nU.S. District Judge P.K. Holmes disagreed. The judge concluded that as many 600 ballots may be thrown out in the November election because of signature mismatches – a \"shockingly high\" number, in his words – but he ruled that the League of Women Voters did not prove its members' ballots would be the ones rejected, so he dismissed their request.\n\nCalifornia\n\nA citizen trying to get an initiative on the ballot to expand the use of food trucks argued that the coronavirus pandemic limited his ability to gather enough signatures. A judge denied him, arguing that public health takes precedence over his initiative.\n\nYet a group of environmentalists making a similar request to get a recycling initiative on the ballot were given a 2½-month extension to collect enough signatures. And a group of Native American tribes pushing a sports betting initiative was given 35 additional days to gather signatures.\n\nThe most controversial lawsuit, however, involves drop boxes that have been placed in several California counties by the state's Republican Party. Unlike the official drop boxes used throughout the country that are placed, monitored and collected by county election officials, the boxes in California are unofficial, managed entirely by GOP officials.\n\nXavier Becerra, the state’s Democratic attorney general, sued the Republican Party in state court, requesting that the party disclose the location of each drop box and the names, addresses and dates of birth of every voter who has used one. Republicans refused, arguing that the boxes were legal under the state’s “ballot harvesting” law that allows third parties to deliver mail-in ballots on behalf of voters. On Oct. 21, Superior Court Judge David Brown sided with the GOP, rejecting the attorney general’s request to investigate, but allowing the case to proceed.\n\nIn an email to The Associated Press, Becerra’s office wrote that they will continue pressing the legal case \"to ensure that every voter who casts their ballot will have their voices heard.\"\n\nThe Republican Party had its own response.\n\n\"This is a thuggish voter intimidation and vote suppression tactic by our Democratic Attorney General and Secretary of State,\" said Hector Barajas, spokesman for the California Republican Party.\n\nColorado\n\nCandidates and supporters of citizen initiatives made multiple requests to be included on the ballot, arguing that they only fell short of the number of signatures needed because COVID-19 restrictions made it difficult – and irresponsible – to collect them.\n\nOne Senate candidate gathered 51% of the required signatures and another gathered 90%. Each of them won initial approval from judges.\n\n\"A candidate who still manages to collect at least one-half of the required valid number of signatures from an electorate absorbed within a global pandemic, has shown he or she enjoys enough public support to justify putting the candidate on a primary ballot,\" Denver District Court Judge Christopher Baumann said during a hearing in May.\n\nIn each case, the state Supreme Court overturned the judges. The court ruled that limitations on gathering signatures has been \"one of the unfortunate impacts of the virus,\" but ultimately found that gathering enough signatures is a \"strict\" requirement of state law.\n\nConnecticut\n\nThe legal battles in Connecticut have focused on the state’s decision to mail absentee ballot applications to all registered voters. Several Republican candidates for office challenged the governor’s order because the state only allows people to vote absentee for a limited number of reasons.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Thomas Moukawsher struck down the Republicans’ request, arguing that the governor was empowered to make changes to the process in the name of public health. The judge focused on one of the existing excuses to vote absentee listed in the state's constitution: \"because of sickness.\"\n\n\"COVID-19 is the scourge of the earth,\" the judge wrote. \"It is a sickness of a lethality and ubiquity unknown for a hundred years. So it can be said with some confidence that the executive branch has not so broadly interpreted the constitutional language as to make it meaningless.\"\n\nDelaware\n\nOnly two election-related lawsuits have been filed in Delaware.\n\nIn one case, the League of Women Voters of Delaware requested that the deadline to receive mail-in ballots be extended by 10 days. Nearly 3% of votes cast in the state’s July presidential primary arrived too late, the result of increased absentee voting this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and delays at the U.S. Postal Service. If that trend holds for the November election, the organization worries that thousands of votes will be thrown out.\n\n\"This disenfranchisement – which is all but guaranteed for some number of voters – is tantamount to depriving voters of access to the polls,\" the league wrote in court papers.\n\nIn another case, the Delaware Republican Party challenged a universal vote-by-mail plan passed by the state’s Democrat-run General Assembly to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Mirroring lawsuits filed in other states, the Delaware Republicans argued that such a dramatic increase in mail-in voting would throw the entire election into question because the vote-by-mail system \"is rife with potential problems and pitfalls.\"\n\nJudges denied both requests.\n\nFlorida\n\nFlorida is already infamous for its role in the 2000 election recount, which left the presidential election undecided for five weeks and launched a 20-year period of nonstop litigation that has grown year after year.\n\n2020 has been no different, with judges deciding everything from voter registration deadlines to drop boxes to the order in which candidate names must appear on the ballot. But one case may end up being the most influential in terms of how many people get to vote in November.\n\nIn 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment allowing most felons to regain their right to vote. But the next year, the Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a law forcing felons to repay all of their court fees, fines and restitution before regaining their right to vote.\n\nCritics have called the law a modern-day poll tax. Supporters have said they’re simply carrying out the will of the voters.\n\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the state, upholding the law in September on a straight party-line vote. The six judges on the court who sided with Florida were appointed by Republican presidents, including five appointed by Trump. The four judges who opposed Florida were named by Democratic presidents.\n\n\"Because court costs and fees are legitimate parts of a criminal sentence – that is, part of the debt to society that felons must pay for their crimes – there is no basis to regard them as a tax,\" the appeals court ruled.\n\nThe end result is that 770,000 Floridians who could have voted in November must now repay every dollar they owe before regaining their right to vote. And in a state that was decided by 537 votes in 2000, and tiny fractions in every presidential election since, that decision could make all the difference.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMost lawsuits requesting expanded voting opportunities have been struck down by Trump-appointed judges in this Republican-dominated state.\n\nOne case saw a federal judge appointed by Obama order the state to extend the deadline to receive absentee ballots three days after Election Day. A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, which included two judges appointed by Trump, struck down that ruling, keeping the absentee ballot deadline in place.\n\nIn another case, a group requested that the state send absentee ballot applications in Spanish to Gwinnett County voters, since the Atlanta suburb is 22% Hispanic. U.S. District Judge William Ray seemed to agree, concluding that providing ballots in their native language was \"reasonable\" and \"may very well be the best public policy.\" Still, the judge – a Trump appointee – denied the request on a technicality: county election officials are required by law to distribute Spanish-language election material, but the state, which distributed the ballots, was under no such requirement.\n\nIn a separate suit, the Democratic Party of Georgia requested wholesale changes, including more voting locations, poll workers and technical support to fix malfunctioning voting machines, after the state’s June primary led to people waiting up to eight hours in line to vote and voters again faced long lines at the start of early voting in the general election. The Democrats argued that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has overseen a methodical process of closing polling locations and limiting services that have led to \"voters (and particularly minority voters) waiting in unconscionably long lines to exercise their right to vote.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Brown – a Trump appointee – denied the request, concluding that the Democratic Party had \"not shown long lines are certainly impending in November.\"\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho hasn’t seen much election litigation, but one of its cases had the distinction of being one of the few where the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in with a written opinion.\n\nThe high court has delivered a handful of rulings that have limited access to voting so far, but most of its decisions have been issued with no explanation. But in July, the justices chimed in on a lawsuit filed by Reclaim Idaho, a group trying to get an initiative on the November ballot that would increase educational funding in the state.\n\nLower courts had sided with the group, ordering the state to either put the initiative on the ballot or grant the group more time to reach the 56,000 signatures it needed. The Supreme Court blocked those rulings because the High Court already saw conflicting orders around the country on the topic of ballot initiatives and indicated it would end up ruling on those conflicts sometime later.\n\n\"Since the onset of the pandemic, the Circuits have applied their conflicting frameworks to reach predictably contrary conclusions,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.\n\nThe Reclaim Idaho case was sent back to lower courts and is ongoing.\n\nIllinois\n\nThe Cook County Republican Party filed a lawsuit challenging Democratic Gov. J. B. Pritzker's emergency orders expanding absentee voting, arguing they would lead to widespread voter fraud.\n\nU.S. District Judge Robert Dow – appointed by President George W. Bush – disagreed, ruling that the Republican Party's arguments came down to \"unsupported speculation about potential criminal conduct.\"\n\nIndiana\n\nIndiana voters filed several lawsuits to expand absentee voting. But each time, judges appointed by Republican presidents turned down those requests.\n\nState law allows people to request absentee ballots only if they are over 65, disabled or have another documented reason to stay home. During the state’s June primary, the Indiana Election Commission allowed all voters to request absentee ballots because the state was under a stay-at-home order.\n\nBut the commission decided that in-person voting must return for the November election. A group of citizens challenged that ruling but were struck down by a Trump-appointed federal judge and denied again by a three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals – all appointed by Republican presidents.\n\nThe appeals court recognized the \"difficulties\" Hoosiers may face voting in-person in a state that has repeatedly broken daily coronavirus infection records throughout October.\n\n\"But Indiana's absentee-voting laws are not to blame,\" the appeals court concluded. \"It's the pandemic, not the State, that might affect Plaintiffs' determination to cast a ballot.\"\n\nIn a separate case where public interest groups tried to extend the deadline for the state to receive absentee ballots, a different panel of 7th Circuit Court of Appeals judges – all appointed by Republican presidents – was more blunt in denying the request.\n\n\"As long as the state allows voting in person, there is no constitutional right to vote by mail,\" they wrote.\n\nIowa\n\nThe Republican Party was active in Iowa’s courts this year, winning victories that expanded in-person polling locations and limited absentee voting in the few Democratic strongholds in the Republican state.\n\nIn one case, a former Republican state senator asked a judge to expand the number of polling locations in Woodbury County from two to five, arguing that Republicans, and especially men, tend to vote in-person on Election Day and that the state’s emphasis on absentee voting would harm those voters. A judge agreed, granting the request.\n\nIn another series of cases, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party tried to prevent election officials in three Iowa counties – including two that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 – from sending absentee ballot applications that were prepopulated with the voters’ information. Lawyers for the GOP argued that doing so would open the possibility of voter fraud because election officials couldn't be certain if the applications they received back were signed by the actual voter.\n\nJudges in all three cases agreed, ruling that the election process should be uniform throughout Iowa and that election officials must only send out blank absentee ballot applications. In Woodbury County, a judge also ordered the county to nullify the estimated 14,000 absentee ballot applications that had already been returned and contact each of those voters that they would need to complete a new, blank application themselves.\n\n\"While this certainly can create hardship with their ability to vote by absentee ballot, it will not prevent them from still being able to vote by absentee ballot or in-person,\" state District Court Judge Patrick Tott wrote.\n\nKentucky\n\nA lawsuit filed by a group of Republican voters charged that in its efforts to ease mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic, the state of Kentucky actually made it harder for people to vote in person.\n\nThe suit, filed in June ahead of the primary election, questioned the decision by election officials to have only one polling location in five of the most populous counties in the state. The plaintiffs argued that cramming so many people into one voting location would expose people to COVID-19, since social distancing will be difficult and voting machines may not be sanitized between each use.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that the move violates part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, saying singular polling locations will disproportionately hinder African American communities in Jefferson and Fayette counties, which hold roughly 60% of the commonwealth’s Black population.\n\nU.S. District Judge Charles Simpson, who was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, struck down the request, ruling that voters had expanded access to absentee voting this year and 15 days of early, in-person voting.\n\n\"While it may seem intuitive that, when it comes to polling places, more is better, that is not a call for this Court to make, unless we first find a constitutional or statutory violation,\" Simpson wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nSeveral groups filed a lawsuit requesting that Louisiana add more early voting days to reduce congestion at the polls.\n\nDuring a September court hearing held over a Zoom video call, the state called as one of its witnesses a doctor who expressed skepticism over the severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in Louisiana, according to court documents. Philip Barie, a professor of surgery and public health, claimed that the number of COVID-19 cases may be \"gross overestimates\" and downplayed the risk of in-person voting to Louisiana voters.\n\n\"But, when asked about his personal COVID-19 risk tolerance, he was far less cavalier,\" U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick later wrote. \"Barie testified that if he had close contact with a person infected with COVID-19, he would quarantine and would not vote in person (this would be an option for Dr. Barie, since he lives in New York City, which has implemented universal vote by mail due to the Virus).\"\n\nAfter that hearing, the judge ordered that early voting be extended from seven days to 10 days, a rare win for Louisiana voters who have struggled to expand voting options even as their coronavirus infections have skyrocketed throughout September and October.\n\nIn a separate case, several advocacy groups tried to expand absentee voting to a broader range of people, including a Black woman who suffers from asthma, according to court records. Her diagnosis was \"environmentally induced\" by pollutants near her home in Baton Rouge, which is part of a region known as \"Cancer Alley\" because of the high number of severe illnesses suffered by people living near chemical plants. Those residents are now disproportionately dying from COVID-19.\n\nA judge rejected the request, arguing that Louisiana’s election laws are constitutional.\n\nMore:Racism turned their neighborhood into 'Cancer Alley.’ Now they’re dying from COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nA group of blind voters won a victory when it forced the state into providing an absentee voting system that they could use.\n\nThe group argued that they can’t vote in person during a pandemic because blind people rely on carpools and public transportation to travel, exposing them to others with the virus, and navigating a polling location would force them to touch many surfaces to go through the line and fill in their ballot.\n\nThe state’s paper-based absentee voting system is no help either. The group requested that Maine follow the lead of other states by allowing them to use screen reader and ballot-marking software that allows blind people to mark their picks and sign their ballots electronically.\n\n\"Plaintiffs have been denied that right in violation of federal and state laws,\" the lawsuit read.\n\nOn Oct. 2, one month before Election Day, the state announced it would create a new online service that allows blind voters to use assistive technology to cast their votes from home.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story erroneously listed the resolution of a court case in Maine and several court rulings in Arizona. The state is handled by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nMaryland\n\nIndependent and third-party candidates filed several lawsuits requesting that the state reduce the number of signatures required to get on the ballot.\n\n\"The prime venues for collection of petition signatures historically have been large gatherings, such as fairs, festivals and sporting events, during warm weather months. Since March, all such events have been cancelled in Maryland,\" wrote lawyers representing candidates for the Green Party and Libertarian Party.\n\nThe lawsuits led to settlement agreements where the state lowered the required signatures from 10,000 to 5,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nIn a rare case of bipartisan litigation, two Democrats and one Republican candidate for Congress requested that the state make it easier for candidates to gather signatures to get their names on the primary and general election ballots.\n\n\"These candidates simply do not have the ability to collect the required numbers of signatures from voters unable to leave their homes and advised to limit contact with others,\" their lawyers wrote.\n\nA judge agreed, ordering the state to reduce the number of signatures required by 50%, allowing candidates to submit electronic signatures supporting their candidacy and extending the deadline to submit all signatures.\n\nVoters with \"print disabilities\" also scored a victory when a lawsuit they filed led to an agreement with the state that expanded their access to vote. The plaintiffs included people who are blind, have low vision or suffer from mobility or dexterity problems that make it impossible for them to read, write, hold or manipulate paper documents.\n\nUnder the agreement, the state will allow the voters to request a ballot and cast their vote by email using existing technology that assists the visually impaired.\n\nMichigan\n\nAfter the National Federation for the Blind filed a lawsuit claiming its members could not fill out paper absentee ballots on their own, U.S. District Judge Gershwin Drain ordered the state to provide them with a manner to fill out their ballots using \"screen reader technology\" that is commonly used for other kinds of reading.\n\nSeveral groups filed challenges to the state's deadline to receive absentee ballots by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The groups argued that COVID-19 restrictions coupled with reported delays in the U.S. Post Office could lead to thousands of ballots being thrown out for arriving late. They cited the fact that at least 6,405 absentee ballot arrived too late during the August primary, and Trump won the 2016 election by 10,704 votes.\n\nA state Court of Appeals panel rejected those requests, arguing that the state has made enough accommodations for absentee voters.\n\n\"When choosing to submit an absentee ballot by mail, one assumes the risk that the ballot will not arrive by the deadline (any deadline), or even arrive at all,\" the judges wrote.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWith Minnesota moving to more mail-in voting, multiple lawsuits requested the state extend the Election Day deadline to receive absentee ballots and to eliminate the requirement that a witness sign each absentee ballot.\n\nThe challenges were filed by elderly residents worried about bringing an infected person into their home and college students studying in other states worried about their ballots arriving on time. One lawsuit noted that 40% of Minnesotans over 65 live alone and that Black and Indigenous voters are at higher risk of dying from COVID-19 because of their underlying conditions.\n\nThe Republican Party tried to intervene in one of the cases to block any changes, but a judge denied them and accepted a settlement agreement that granted most of the requests.\n\nUnder the deal finalized in July, absentee ballots were to be accepted if they were postmarked by Election Day and received by election officials within a week, and ballots would no longer require a witness signature.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled Thursday that the agreement violated the U.S. Constitution because the secretary of state's acceptance of the agreement \"extended the receipt of ballots without legislative authorization.\"\n\n\"Simply put, the Secretary has no power to override the Minnesota Legislature,\" which enacted the Election Day deadline for receiving ballots, the court ruled.\n\nThe three-judge panel sent the case back to the district court with instructions to issue a preliminary injunction requiring compliance with the original deadline. Ballots received after Election Day are to be set aside and preserved, the ruling said.\n\nThe ruling acknowledged that the nearly last-minute injunction \"may create harm in terms of voter confusion.\" However, the court said, \"inevitable post-election challenges to the counting of invalid ballots if no injunction is granted is even more problematic since it would give voters no opportunity to adjust their mailing time or to deliver their mail-in ballots on Election Day to obviate their risk.\"\n\nAnother lawsuit filed in Minnesota is challenging the requirement that people wear masks in polling locations. The nonpartisan Minnesota Voters Alliance argued that state law makes it a crime to wear a mask in public, but the state is requiring masks at voting locations, forcing people to violate one law or another in order to vote.\n\nU.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz rejected that argument, writing that the state’s ban on masks was first enacted in 1923 to limit the rise of the Klu Klux Klan and was \"clearly\" designed to prevent people from purposefully concealing their identity. Wearing a mask in the midst of a global pandemic, the judge ruled, does not violate that law.\n\n\"The statute makes it unlawful to wear disguises,\" the judge wrote.\n\nMississippi\n\nVoting absentee has never been easy in Mississippi, and civil rights groups say that's by design.\n\n\"Mississippi has some of the most restrictive burdens on absentee voting in the nation that run afoul of the constitution and have a particularly stark impact on Black voters,\" said Jennifer Nwachukwu, attorney at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law.\n\nMany states allow any voter to cast an absentee ballot, but in Mississippi, voters have to fall into a list of \"excuses\" to do so. One of the allowable reasons is for a \"temporary or permanent physical disability,\" but judges and legislators have made clear that exception does mean everyone can use the COVID-19 pandemic as reason to vote absentee.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature recently amended the law to state that a \"temporary physical disability\" includes any voter who is \"under a physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19 during the year 2020 or is caring for a dependent who is under a physician-imposed quarantine due to COVID-19.\" And last month, the Mississippi Supreme Court dismissed a request that people with underlying medical conditions be allowed to vote absentee.\n\n\"Having a preexisting condition that puts a voter at a higher risk does not automatically create a temporary disability for absentee-voting purposes,\" the court ruled.\n\nMontana\n\nThree key lawsuits significantly altered the way Montanans vote in November.\n\nIn one case, a group of Native American tribes requested that a judge strike down a state law that limits the number of ballots that one person can deliver on behalf of others. The groups argued their members live in isolated areas with high levels of poverty, making a trip to a polling station or even a mailbox can be incredibly difficult.\n\nState District Court Judge Jessica Fehr agreed, ruling that the state law created too large a burden on Native American voters.\n\n\"The questions presented cannot be viewed through the lens of our own upbringings or own life experiences, but through the lens of the cold, hard data that was presented at trial about the clear limitations Native American communities in Montana face,\" Fehr wrote.\n\nIn another case filed by the Democratic Party, a judge extended the Election Day deadline for absentee ballots, allowing all votes postmarked by Election Day to be counted.\n\nAnd in a third case, the Trump campaign and the Republican Party requested that a judge block Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock’s order allowing for universal mail-in voting. The GOP argued that the order was a \"brazen power grab\" that opens the election to \"fraud, coercion, theft, and otherwise illegitimate voting.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Christensen – an Obama appointee – called the Republicans' claims \"a fiction.\"\n\n\"When pressed during the hearing in this matter, the Plaintiffs were compelled to concede that they cannot point to a single instance of voter fraud in Montana in any election during the last 20 years,\" Christensen wrote.\n\nNevada\n\nThe Trump campaign filed a lawsuit challenging a law passed by the state’s Democratic legislature and signed into law by the Democratic governor that expands absentee voting in the November election.\n\nTrump's attorneys argued that the changes were rushed into law and would lead to \"chaos\" in election offices. U.S. District Judge James Mahan – appointed by President George W. Bush – struck down the lawsuit, ruling that the Trump campaign did not have standing to challenge the state law.\n\n\"The Trump campaign does not represent Nevada voters,\" Mahan wrote. \"The Trump campaign represents only Donald J. Trump and his 'electoral and political goals' of reelection.\"\n\nSimilar lawsuits were filed by Sharron Angle, a Republican who failed in her 2010 U.S. Senate campaign, and a group of citizens who argued that an all-mail election would lead to the collapse of the state and the nation's \"republican form of government.\"\n\nA judge struck down each lawsuit, ruling that protecting the health of citizens was paramount in the midst of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nThe Trump campaign and the Republican Party scored a win in the Granite State when a judge refused to extend the Election Day deadline for absentee ballots.\n\nA teacher’s union filed a lawsuit challenging the election system implemented by the state’s Republican governor and Democratic legislature. The union argued that the 5 p.m. Election Day deadline and the requirement that a witness sign all absentee ballots posed a challenge to its members, many of whom are older and at higher risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\nSuperior Court Judge William Delker struck down those requests, ruling that the state has already taken steps to make it easier to vote absentee this year and that witness signature requirements are needed to ensure the validity of each ballot. As for the Election Day deadline, Delker wrote that: “Voters have ample time to request, complete, and return their registrations and/or ballots prior to the election.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe Trump campaign and local Republicans filed several lawsuits challenging the decision by New Jersey’s Democratic governor and Democratic-led Legislature to transition to a mostly mail-in vote in November in the name of public health.\n\nIn its lawsuit, the campaign cited several instances of alleged voter fraud in New Jersey, including a case in Paterson where a campaign worker admitted to investigators that she stole ballots out of mailboxes. The lawsuit charged that those cases reveal the risks of absentee voting and would dilute the \"legitimate votes of honest citizens.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Shipp, an Obama appointee, disagreed, ruling that the Trump campaign did not show that the previous, isolated cases of fraud meant that widespread fraud in the November election was \"inevitable.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit, a judge granted a request that voters be allowed an opportunity to correct alleged mismatches between the signature on their absentee ballot and the signature on file with the state. The judge ordered all county election offices to notify those voters within 24 hours and give them time to verify their vote.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTwenty-seven of the 33 county clerks in Democratic-leaning New Mexico filed a lawsuit in March arguing that they couldn’t responsibly hold the state’s June primary election because so many of the regular polling stations were closed at the time because of the pandemic.\n\nThey requested the state move to all-mail voting. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court granted them a partial win, allowing them to send absentee ballot registrations to all voters but requiring them to maintain some polling locations open for in-person voting.\n\nNew York\n\nDisability Rights New York and other organizations and individuals filed a federal lawsuit seeking an order for the state to provide voting alternatives for disabled people who are fearful of voting in-person due to the coronavirus pandemic. The groups represent people living with blindness, low vision and physical disabilities such as paralysis.\n\n\"Defendants have discriminated against Plaintiffs because their service, program, or activity of absentee voting is inaccessible,” the lawsuit alleged.\n\nPlaintiffs in the case include Rasheta Bunting, a registered voter in Brooklyn. She has low vision and does not have sufficient eyesight to read, mark and sign a standard print ballot without assistance, the court complaint said.\n\nThe two sides agreed to a settlement approved by a judge. The state will order county election boards to distribute \"an accessible fillable PDF absentee ballot\" that people with print disabilities can use to vote in the primary election. The parties later agree on a settlement to implement a similar program for the November election, where voters with print disabilities will receive a form \"that is screen readable using common assistive technology.\"\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nIn 2020, North Carolina election lawsuits featured challenges over witness requirements for voter signatures on absentee ballots, giving voters an opportunity to correct problems with their absentee ballots, and other issues.\n\nBut the most-watched case focused on whether voters would win extra time to have their absentee ballots received and counted.\n\nThe state’s election board agreed on Sept. 22 to accept mail-in votes postmarked by Nov. 3 that arrive before Nov. 12. That represents a six-day extension of the previous Nov. 6 deadline set by state lawmakers. The board also agreed to provide more opportunities to correct deficient absentee ballots and add absentee ballot drop-off locations.\n\nThe leaders of the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature asked a federal court judge to throw out the agreement. They argued that the board was administering the 2020 election “in an arbitrary and nonuniform manner.”\n\nA federal judge granted a temporary restraining order that blocked state election officials from continuing to use the expanded voting plan. On Oct. 14, another judge denied the request for a preliminary injunction, arguing that it was too late to overhaul the voting process, \"even in the face of what appear to be clear violations\" of state election procedures. The ruling allowed the extended voting plan to continue.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reviewed the legal arguments in a proceeding that consolidated multiple cases. In the 12-3 ruling issued on Oct. 20, the appeals court refused to grant a preliminary injunction that would have overturned the extended voting plan.\n\nTrump's election campaign asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review and reverse the appeals court decision. However, the high court denied the application Wednesday in a ruling that let the extended deadline stand.\n\nBarrett did not participate in the ruling, the court said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nSelf Advocacy Solutions, the League of Women Voters of North Dakota and a voter filed a constitutional challenge to the state’s system for verifying voter’s signatures on mail-in ballots. They alleged that the people who perform the comparisons aren’t trained properly.\n\n“The State rejects hundreds of ballots cast by eligible North Dakota voters every election because of this unreliable ballot verification process, disproportionately disenfranchising voters prone to signature variability, specifically people with disabilities, non-native English speakers, and both young and elderly voters,” the court complaint said.\n\nThe lawsuit cited the experience of Maria Fallon Romo, a regular voter and resident of Grand Forks who has voted by mail and assumed her votes had been counted. They were not.\n\n“Ms. Romo was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1997. As a result of her MS, it is difficult for her to write neatly or consistently,” the court complaint said. “Ms. Romo did not know that a signature on her ballot application that did not ‘correspond’ with the one provided on her ballot could invalidate her ballot, particularly without any notice to her beforehand.”\n\nBoth sides in the case agreed to a permanent injunction that requires county voting officials to notify voters if the signature on their ballots don’t match with the ones on file. The officials are required to first try calling the voter, then mailing them a notice, and giving them time to verify the signature before the state locks in final vote tallies six days after Election Day.\n\nOhio\n\nThe A. Philip Randolph Institute of Ohio, an organization of African American trade union members, filed a federal court constitutional challenge to Ohio's one drop box per county for accepting completed absentee ballots. Citing an expected torrent of absentee votes during the coronavirus pandemic, the lawsuit said “absent immediate injunctive relief, hundreds of thousands of Ohioans stand to have their votes suppressed” because of the Ohio secretary of state’s decision “depriving Ohioans of a sufficient number of secure drop boxes.\"\n\nThe court ultimately issued a preliminary injunction in favor of the institute. \"The Secretary has not advanced any legitimate reason to prohibit a county board of elections from utilizing off-site drop boxes and/or off-site delivery of ballots to staff,” the court ruled.\n\nA split decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit of appeals stayed the injunction. Federal courts should not micromanage state election processes, the judges ruled, citing a 2016 federal court ruling.\n\nOklahoma\n\nA Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee complaint filed in federal court challenged what it called \"onerous and unnecessary\" election law requirements for notarization and witnessing of ballots, photo IDs for voters, lack of prepaid postage for mail ballots and other rules that the committee said would make voting more difficult during the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe court ruled that the state had created alternatives for voters to file absentee ballots without direct contact with others. Dismissing the case, the ruling also said \"the state’s interests in preventing voter fraud and promoting certainty and confidence are sufficiently weighty to overcome any minor burden imposed upon Oklahoma voters during the pandemic.\"\n\nOregon\n\nA community organization called People Not Politicians sought a ballot initiative that would amend the state constitution to assign the redistricting maps for the state Senate, House and U.S. House of Representatives seats to an independent commission. The coronavirus pandemic made it difficult for the organization to get the signatures required to qualify for this year’s ballots. A federal district court granted an injunction that reduced the number of required signatures and extended the filing deadline.\n\nThe state sought a stay of the ruling. After the district court denied the application, the case ultimately went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which imposed a stay and agreed to consider the case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said the stay made the case moot, because the Supreme Court would likely not decide the issue before the deadline to place the initiative on Oregon ballots.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPennsylvania is among a few states that proved crucial to Trump’s 2016 victory. Widely viewed as a swing state again this year, Pennsylvania has been the site of multiple 2020 election law challenges, and a U.S. Supreme Court announcement six days before Election Day in a closely watched case.\n\nThe lawsuit features Democratic Party officials’ challenges to several provisions of state election laws. They sought rulings on whether election boards may establish drop boxes to receive completed ballots, whether the deadline for receiving mail ballots by 8 p.m. on Election Day could be changed during the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Postal System delivery problems and other issues.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that county election boards could receive mail ballots at drop boxes and other locations other than the boards’ main offices. Citing USPS delivery problems and the crush of voters using mail ballots during the coronavirus pandemic, the court also ruled that election boards could accept mail ballots by 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, a three-day extension from the deadline set by state lawmakers. The court denied an application for a stay filed by state Republican officials.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 on whether to consider two applications for stays of the decision. That let the lower court ruling stand. Pennsylvania Republicans returned to the U.S. Supreme Court late last week with an application for expedited consideration of a full review by the nation's highest court.\n\nThe court denied the motion on Wednesday without Barrett taking part. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, wrote that there was insufficient time to decide the issue before Election Day.\n\nAlito, referring to the state court's decision to alter the mail ballot deadline set by the state Legislature, wrote that the issue \"has national importance, and there is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution.\"\n\nAlito left the door open to further action by the high court as it continues to weigh a full review of the matter. He raised the possibility that the court could order Pennsylvania ballots received after Election Day be segregated from other ballots for further consideration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nGovernment watchdog Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and individual voters filed a constitutional challenge to the state requirement that voters who submit absentee ballots must have them notarized or signed by two people who witnessed the voter’s signature. The lawsuit alleged the requirement was an undue burden on voters during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBoth sides in the case reached a consent agreement suspending enforcement of the law for the 2020 primary election and Nov. 3 national election. The Republican National Committee intervened and moved for a stay on the consent agreement. The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit denied the motion, in part because no Rhode Island elected officials voiced public opposition to the settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, South Carolina voters and the state’s Democratic Party challenged the constitutionality of several election laws. The provisions restrict mail voting in some cases by age, require a witness signature on ballot envelopes, require proper postage for mail ballots, limit who can help a voter return a mail ballot and reject ballots received after 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nThe parties reached a settlement on the postage issue. The district court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction that enjoined the state from enforcing the witness signature policy for the 2020 election but denied relief on other issues.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court granted in part an application for a stay of the ruling on Oct. 5. The action reimposed the witness signature requirement, but exempted ballots already filed or received within two days of the high court’s action.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that he agreed with the stay because decisions about safety and health should be left to politically accountable officials in the states.\n\n“Second, for many years, this court has repeatedly emphasized that federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election rules in the period close to an election,” Kavanaugh wrote. “By enjoining South Carolina’s witness requirement shortly before the election, the district court defied that principle and this court’s precedents.”\n\nTennessee\n\nA Tennessee state court lawsuit challenged election laws that place restrictions on who is eligible to vote by absentee ballot.\n\nThe case was filed earlier this year on behalf of plaintiffs who are immunocompromised or who have other ailments that could make them vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nThe court granted an injunction that temporarily required the state to provide absentee ballots to any eligible Tennessee voter who applies to vote by mail due to concern about contracting or transmitting the disease.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Tennessee said the ruling went too far. Ruling in August, the court said that only people who have special vulnerability to COVID-19 or who provide care for those with that vulnerability should qualify for absentee ballots.\n\nOverturning the lower court's injunction, the state Supreme Court ruled that the \"state’s interests in the efficacy and integrity of the election process are sufficient to justify the moderate burden placed on the right to vote of those\" who don't have particular vulnerability to the coronavirus.\n\nTexas\n\nState or federal courts in the Lone Star State handled more than 20 election-related legal challenges during 2020.\n\nOne case alleged that Gov. Greg Abbott's one-per-county limit on ballot drop-off locations would \"unreasonably burden\" citizens' ability to vote and force them to \"risk exposure to COVID-19.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman, who was nominated to the federal bench by Obama, ruled in favor of a preliminary injunction. The public interest would be best served by “ensuring that qualified absentee voters, who comprise some of the most vulnerable citizens in Texas, can exercise their right to vote and have that vote counted.”\n\nHowever, a three-judge panel of judges nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit by Trump reversed Pitman’s ruling and upheld Abbott's order. \"The district court vastly overstated the 'character and magnitude' of the burden allegedly placed on voting rights ... Indeed, one strains to see how it burdens voting at all,\" the judges ruled.\n\nLeaving Abbot’s order in place “still gives Texas absentee voters many ways to cast their ballots in the November 3 election,” and “abridges no one’s right to vote,” the judges ruled.\n\nVermont\n\nFive voters, three of them present or former government officials, sued the Vermont secretary of state over a statewide election directive issued in July designed to send absentee ballots to all registered voters.\n\nThe lawsuit argued that the directive would inevitably send some ballots to people who have moved or died. People who are otherwise ineligible to vote may cast some of the ballots, the lawsuit also alleged.\n\nU.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford in September denied a motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case on grounds that the people who sued lacked legal standing to represent all Vermonters. \"Of all people likely to be confused about how to vote, these five plaintiffs must be last on the list,\" Crawford wrote.\n\nVirginia\n\nA member of the National Federation of the Blind of Virginia joined other disabled voters in challenging what they alleged was the state's failure to provide accessible vote-by-mail options to voters who are blind, have low vision or who suffer from impaired manual dexterity.\n\nA partial settlement agreement reached in August requires the state to help voters like these by providing them with screen reader assisting technology that enables them to electronically receive and mare absentee ballots.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington is one of 14 states that sued Trump and the U.S. Postal Service over operational changes to mail processing and handling that slowed deliveries of regular mail, prescriptions and packages. State officials said the changes could slow applications for absentee ballots, as well as filings of the completed ballots.\n\nIn September, a federal judge issued a temporary injunction that blocked the Postal Service from continuing to use the changed workplace instructions. The injunction requires the Postal Service to use \"extraordinary measures\" to speed deliveries of election ballots.\n\nThe court is continuing to review the postal system's performance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWest Virginia’s Democratic Party challenged the state's decades-old system of deciding which party’s candidates are listed first on ballots, arguing the procedure gave an unfair edge to the first candidates listed. They submitted evidence from a political psychologist who calculated the advantage at 2.94%.\n\nThe system uses the results of the most recent presidential election to decide which candidate slate gets listed first for the succeeding four years. That means that Trump and other Republicans will be listed first.\n\n\"To award candidates from a favored political party an extra 2.94 percentage points in an election would be blatantly unconstitutional. To do the same through the allocation of ballot position without a weighty justification is also unconstitutional,” wrote U.S. District Judge Robert Chambers in an August ruling that permanently enjoined the West Virginia secretary of state’s office from using the protocol.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit subsequently granted a stay that enabled the state to continue using the system while a full appeal of the ruling continues.\n\nWisconsin\n\nA major U.S. Supreme Court ruling just over a week before Election Day will affect some voters who file absentee ballots in Wisconsin, a state Trump narrowly won in 2016 and that is viewed as a swing state again this year.\n\nBy a 5-3 vote, the high court let stand a lower appeals court decision that means absentee ballots must be received by local boards of election by 8 p.m. on Election Day. The decision dealt the final legal blow to an earlier federal district court ruling that the boards would have to accept absentee ballots as long as six days after the elections.\n\n\"Elections must end sometime, a single deadline supplies clear notice, and requiring ballots be in by election day puts all voters on the same footing,\" wrote Gorsuch, with a concurrence by Kavanaugh.\n\n\"The Constitution provides that state legislatures – not federal judges, not state judges, not state governors, not other state officials – bear primary responsibility for setting election rules,\" wrote Gorsuch.\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, USA TODAY; Jessie Balmert, Cincinnati Enquirer; Jon Campbell, USA TODAY Network New York; Jimmie Gates, The Clarion-Ledger; Clara Hendrickson, Detroit Free Press; John Kennedy, Gannett Florida Capital Bureau; Dylan Segelbaum, York Daily Record; Mariah Timms, The Tennessean; Ben Tobin, Louisville Courier Journal\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story erroneously listed several court rulings in Arizona.

Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBiden signed the American Rescue Plan, a sweeping $1.9 trillion package, into law in early March. The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}]}

He scored 21,081 points in his first 10 seasons, which would make him the No. 41 all-time scorer, and every player who is no longer active with at least 21,000 points is in the Hall of Fame, except Vince Carter who is a finalist this year in his first year of eligibility.\n\nIf you take James’ past 11 seasons, he has 18,910 points, which still puts him in the top 70 at No. 66, just behind Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen’s 18,940 points.\n\nThink of all the points the Golden State Warriors scored from 2014-15 to 2017-18 when they won three titles with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant on rosters. In those four seasons, they totaled 37,244 points. Singled-handedly, James has scored more points than a dynasty did over four seasons.\n\nWhat draws a chuckle – and just because the Lakers have had so many great players – is that James is just No. 13 on the Lakers’ all-time scoring list in his six seasons.\n\nNBA:LeBron hits 40,000 career points. Will anyone else ever score that many?\n\nLEBRON:Revisit milestone moments in James' march to 40,000 points\n\nWhen he scored 31 points earlier this season, he became the first player to have 30-point games separated by at least 20 years.\n\nAnd he is on pace to become just the second player to score at least 1,600 points in his rookie season and at least 1,600 points at 39 years old, joining, yes of course, Michael Jordan.\n\nAveraging 25.2 points this season – four more than his rookie season – James will become the oldest player to score more than 20.6 points per game in a season, and if he averages at least 20 points next season, he will become the first player 40 or older to hit that mark.\n\nAmong James’ scoring records and achievements, his streak of 1,204 consecutive games with at least 10 points is one of the most underrated and underappreciated. He last scored fewer than 10 points on Jan. 6, 2007 with eight points against Milwaukee. Every game since then, at least 10 points. Jordan is No. 2 on the list with 866 consecutive games with 10 or more points, and Philadelphia's Joel Embiid is next active player on the list at 169 games. Like Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game, it’s difficult to see anyone touching that record.\n\nMaking it more impressive, he's never been one-dimensional. James has accumulated a record number of points while also accumulating an astounding amount of assists. He is No. 4 on the all-time assists list behind Chris Paul and has an outside chance to pass Paul depending on how much longer both play. James is the only player in the top four in both all-time points and assists and just one other player is in the top 20 – Oscar Robertson at No. 8 in assists and No. 14 in scoring.\n\nJames' production of points directly through scoring or indirectly through assists spotlights the unique offensive player he is. And it’s been on display from his first game in 2003 when he had 25 points and nine assists through Wednesday’s game against the Los Angeles Clippers when he had 34 points and eight assists, accounting for 77% of the Lakers’ points in a fourth-quarter comeback – 19 points scored and four assists creating 11 points.\n\nAt 39 years old, James just isn’t hanging on for the final few chapters of his career. His imprint on the game remains significant. You can parse and compare, dissect and examine, and it all leads back to the same conclusion.\n\nThere has never been an all-time like LeBron James and there will never be another like him.\n\nFollow NBA columnist Jeff Zillgitt on social media @JeffZillgitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2024/02/29/lebron-james-40000-points-scoring-tracker/72788100007/", "title": "LeBron James has scored 40,000 points.

It was 1969.\n\nWe know LeBron James is about to pass Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.\n\nBut who did Abdul-Jabbar pass? And when?\n\nAnd what about the league’s all-time leading scorers before that?\n\nJust six players have held the NBA’s scoring title, with Abdul-Jabbar atop the list the longest – it's been almost 40 years since he passed Wilt Chamberlain in 1984.\n\nJames will become the seventh when he jumps Abdul-Jabbar sometime soon. At James’ scoring rate, he will score more than 40,000 points, and it may take another 40-some years before a player eclipses James.\n\nLet’s take a look at who has been atop the NBA’s all-time scoring list:\n\nJoe Fulks, 8,003 points\n\nFulks, who spent his eight-year career with the Philadelphia Warriors, won the scoring title (23.2 points per game) in the league’s first season in 1946-47 and led the league in scoring (22.1 points) the following season. Known for helping introduce the jump shot to the game, Fulks averaged a career-high 26 points in 1948-49 and retired after the 1953-54 season. Fulks attended what is now Murray State where his jersey is retired. Fulks set a then-NBA record with 61 points in 1949 and that remained the best single-game scoring effort until Elgin Baylor had 64 in 1959. Fulks, whose post-basketball career was the director of recreation at a state penitentiary, was killed in 1976 by his girlfriend’s son during a drunken argument over a handgun. He was 54. Fulks was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1978.\n\nCOUNTDOWN: How close is LeBron to setting the NBA all-time scoring mark?\n\nCAN YOU SURVIVE? New pro and college basketball survivor pools are here. Free to play; terms and conditions apply. Join now!\n\nGeorge Mikan, 10,156 points\n\nMikan entered the league in the 1948-49 season from DePaul and was a scorer from the start, putting up at least 30 points in five of his first 10 games. Like Fulks, he didn’t play long, just six-plus seasons, but Mikan averaged 23.1 points (and 13.4 rebounds). He was a six-time All-NBA selection, won the scoring title three times and won five NBA titles. Another dominant big man, the 6-10 Mikan was a masterful scorer at the basket, having perfected layups with his Mikan Drill – practicing right-handed and left-handed layups over and over. Mikan passed Fulks in the 1952-53 season. Mikan, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, helped change the game in multiple ways, including widening the lane and banning goaltending. As commissioner of the ABA, Mikan championed the 3-point line.\n\nDolph Schayes, 18,438 points\n\nIn 1958, during the third quarter of the Syracuse Nationals’ blowout victory against the Detroit Pistons, Schayes became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. A columnist for the Syracuse Post-Standard wrote, “with the record beckoning and his mates feeding him to help him set the mark, Schayes consistently passed off to better-positioned opponents rather than risk poor shots.” Schayes played 15 seasons, averaging 18.5 points for his career, including a career-high 24.9 in 1957-58. Schayes mastered getting to the foul line (7.9 attempts per game) and making free throws (84.9%). Schayes also played in 91% of his team’s games. He was a 12-time All-Star and 12-time All-NBA performer, entering the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.\n\nBob Pettit, 20,880 points\n\nA couple of things about Pettit: 1) He was one of the first players to understand the value of weight training and dismissed those who thought putting on muscle would ruin his shot; 2) When Pettit, playing for the St. Louis Hawks, passed Schayes as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer in 1964, the game was stopped and Cardinals great Stan Musial presented him with the game ball, according to a United Press International story. In the era where big men dominated, Pettit averaged 26.4 points, including a career-high 31.1 (and 18.7 rebounds) in 1961-62. He led the league in scoring twice, was an All-Star in each of his 11 seasons and was named MVP twice. He entered the Hall of Fame in 1971.\n\nWilt Chamberlain, 31,419 points\n\nPettit did not own the record for long. With Chamberlain entering the league in 1959 and unstoppable as a scorer at 7-1, he took over as the all-time scoring leader on Feb. 14, 1966. Chamberlain scored 41 points against Detroit that day and held the record for 18 years. Chamberlain is remembered for his individual scoring feats, including the 100-point game that is one of the most unbreakable records in sports. Chamberlain had 113 games with at least 50 points (next closest is Michael Jordan at 31), including 45 such games in 1961-62, the season Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points. He led the league in scoring seven times, won two titles, earned All-NBA honors 10 times, was named MVP four times and became a Hall of Famer in 1979.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar, 38,387 points\n\nAbdul-Jabbar laced ’em up year after year, for 20 seasons, torching opponents with his low-post game, including his famous sky hook. Coming from UCLA to the NBA in 1969, Abdul-Jabbar was a winner and ready to dominate. He averaged 28.8 points his rookie season, 31.7 the next and 34.8 the next and 30.2 in his fourth season. For 17 consecutive seasons, he averaged at least 22 points, most often in that 24-27 range. He shot 55.9% from the field and was a reliable 72.1% shooter from the foul line. No player has more MVPs than Abdul-Jabbar’s six. He was a 19-time All-Star, 15-time All-NBA selection, won six championships and was Finals MVP twice, joining other greats in the Hall of Fame in 1995.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/11/us/paul-silas-nba-player-coach-obit-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Paul Silas, 3-time NBA champion player and coach, dead at 79 | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer NBA All-Star and longtime head coach Paul Silas has died at the of age 79, the league announced Sunday.\n\n“We mourn the passing of former NBA All-Star and head coach Paul Silas.

Who could pass scoring ...", "text": "Who could pass LeBron James someday as the NBA’s all-time leading scorer?\n\nJames passed Kareem-Abdul Jabbar, who held the record for nearly 40 years, and now has 38,390 after Tuesday's loss to Oklahoma City. James is going to keep adding points, putting himself in position to blow by 40,000 points.\n\nWill that be an unbreakable record – like Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game or Chamberlain’s 50.4 points per game in 1961-62 or even Scott Skiles’ single-game assists record of 30?\n\nJames benefitted from not spending at least one season in college whereas every player since the 2006 draft has needed to be one year removed from his high school graduating class to become draft eligible. That’s a season’s worth of points that James accumulated while players such as Kevin Durant and Luka Doncic had to wait.\n\nLet’s take a look at who could make a run at the all-time scoring record:\n\nKevin Durant, 26,684 career points\n\nDurant’s chances to become the all-time scoring leader have been thwarted by injuries. He played just 27 games in 2014-15, missed 2019-20 with an Achilles injury and played just 35 games the following season. Durant entered the league four years after James and trails him by nearly 12,000 points. At 34 years old and with just a handful of seasons left, it will be difficult for Durant to hit 40,000 points (which is where James will end up). Had he not missed all that time to injuries, he would likely be over 30,000 points with a better chance at passing James. Still, Durant – if healthy – will move into the top 10 in scoring next season and possibly pass Michael Jordan for a spot in the top five by the time his career is over.\n\nJames Harden, 24,233 points\n\nHarden has scored at least 20 points per game for 11 consecutive seasons, including an MVP-caliber stretch in which he averaged 30.4, 36.1 and 34.3 points in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. At 33, even if he were to score 2,000 points a season for the next seven seasons (highly unlikely given his scoring trajectory is on the downswing), he’d still be short of James. Harden is also hurt by low scoring totals his first two seasons.\n\nSteph Curry, 21,183 points\n\nNo one can question Curry’s skill as a scorer. But the occasional injury has hurt his chances to make a run at the all-time scoring record. He played in just 23 games in 2011-12 and five in 2019-20. At just over 21,000 points now, he will need another 19,000 to reach 40,000 – another unlikely scenario given Curry’s age (34). Don’t forget he was a three-year college player whereas James didn’t attend college and Durant spent just one season at Texas. Small guards (6-2 and under) are not represented in the top 25 in all-time scoring and cracking that would be a major accomplishment.\n\nLuka Doncic, 8,531 points\n\nDoncic is the most compelling case study. He entered the league as a scorer, posting 21.2 points per game in 2019-20 and hovered around 28 points per game for the next three seasons and is at 34 points per game this season. With 8,531 career points before the halfway mark of his fifth season, Doncic is on a great pace to become one of the game’s all-time leading scorers. But the all-time leading scorer? That’s more difficult. If Doncic played 70 games and averaged 28.1 points a season, he wouldn’t reach 40,000 points until his 20th season – in 2037-38. Plus, can Doncic manage his heavy workload for that long without impacting his scoring or health?\n\nUnknown player\n\nJames was not born yet when Abdul-Jabbar passed Chamberlain as the league’s all-time leading scorer in 1984. Abdul-Jabbar played another five seasons, padding his lead. Since then, five other players soared by Chamberlain. It’s quite possible and even likely that the person who breaks James’ scoring record – and don’t forget James probably will bust through 40,000 – isn’t in the league right now and might not even be alive. One thing is for certain. For a player to make a run at James’ record, he will benefit from the league eventually ending the one-and-done rule so that players can enter the league at 18 years old without spending a year in college – and start off averaging at least 20 points and have a career average of 27 points for 20 seasons. In other words, another once-in-a-generation player.\n\nFollow NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/pro/cavs/2023/02/08/lebron-james-atop-nba-all-time-scoring-list-as-cavs-akron-cheer-on/69837945007/", "title": "LeBron James atop NBA all-time scoring list as Cavs, Akron cheer on", "text": "Unmet expectations? Not for LeBron James. STVM coach Dru Joyce II reflects on pupil's rise\n\nDid you know LeBron broke a record Kareem Abdul-Jabbar set in 1984 before James' birth at Akron City Hospital?\n\nA Cavaliers legend wants to celebrate James a la the team's 2016 championship parade\n\nAs the number of reporters waiting to ask LeBron James postgame questions ballooned to about 20 during his junior season with the St. Vincent-St. Mary basketball program, a decision was made to streamline interviews by holding news conferences.\n\n“When we traveled around the country, there were some reporters that didn't want to believe that he was that great,” STVM coach Dru Joyce II recently told the Beacon Journal. “There were some that thought that he was catered to, and they came at him like that. He handled it much better than most teenagers would.”\n\nIn the same season, a 17-year-old James appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the title “The Chosen One” and the following caption: “High school junior LeBron James would be an NBA lottery pick right now.” The magazine's publish date of Feb. 18, 2002, came roughly 16 months before the Cavaliers drafted James first overall.\n\n“When the Sports Illustrated thing happened, those are high expectations, but I always believed from those years in high school that he had the shoulders to handle it,” Joyce said. “He was a unique person who could handle all that's been put on him.”\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable aspect of James' legacy as a superstar athlete and international icon is how the Akron native never allowed an unfathomable amount of hype to derail his NBA career.\n\nJames, 38, didn't just meet expectations. He shattered them like a glass backboard victimized by a ferocious slam dunk.\n\nThe resume includes four championships — in 2020 with the Los Angeles Lakers, 2016 with the Cavaliers and 2012-13 with the Miami Heat — four regular-season Most Valuable Player awards, four Finals MVPs and 19 All-Star selections.\n\nAnd on Tuesday night, James added the NBA's all-time scoring record to the long list of achievements he has compiled in his 20 seasons. He surpassed Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387 career points, scoring 38 in the Lakers' 133-130 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles.\n\nLeBron sets record, social media reacts:'GOAT debate is now settled': NBA scoring record reignites LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan arguments\n\nJames entered the game needing 36 points to break the record. He reached the total by making a turnaround jump shot with 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter, and the game was halted to commemorate the occasion. Abdul-Jabbar handed a ball to James, and then they exchanged a handshake and a hug on the court.\n\nLeBron James by the numbers:What's LeBron James' point total from high school to NBA to Team USA? Learn that and more\n\nSpeaking into a microphone, James thanked fans, Abdul-Jabbar, family, friends and other supporters. Swept up in the emotion, James let an f-bomb slip at the end of his brief speech.\n\n“We should have a parade downtown for him because the NBA has been around a long time, and it's a heck of a goal to accomplish,” Cavaliers legend and longtime Bath Township resident Larry Nance Sr. said. “The best fans are here. They all love LeBron. We all do, and we've watched him do so many great things like [spearhead the development of the I Promise School in Akron]. We're all so proud of him, and we're going to celebrate because he's ours. He's Ohio's, and we're going to celebrate just like we won a championship.”\n\nKevin Love honors LeBron:James' Cleveland Cavaliers era, as told by former teammate\n\nJames had already become the NBA's all-time leader in combined regular-season and playoff points. He eclipsed Abdul-Jabbar in the joint category on Feb. 12, 2022.\n\nBut now James is professional basketball's undisputed scoring champion. He has the most points in NBA history in the regular season (38,390), the playoffs (7,631) and the regular season and playoffs added together (46,021).\n\n“In my book, he's already the greatest,” said New Orleans Pelicans forward and Revere High School graduate Larry Nance Jr., who played with James when they were members of the Cavaliers during the 2017-18 season. “He's the greatest player I've ever seen and I think the greatest player who ever touched the court.”\n\nCavs predicted Evan Mobley's breakout:Cleveland Cavaliers coach J.B. Bickerstaff saw a version of Evan Mobley 'that is going to dominate' NBA on offense\n\nThere were reasons to be skeptical about LeBron James handling all the pressure he faced as a teenager\n\nAkron native and former NBA player Jerome Lane Sr. admitted he didn't believe all of this would come to fruition for James.\n\nLane is a former STVM star whose jersey hangs alongside LeBron's in the high school gymnasium named after James. Lane attended all of the Irish's state championship games during the James era and thought the hysteria surrounding the phenom would be detrimental when he reached the NBA.\n\n“For him to start off his career with the weight they put on his neck,” Lane said, “I mean, I just can't believe he survived.\n\n“I'm really going to be honest. I just thought they just threw too much stuff at him at one time for him to bear. I just thought he was going have a mental breakdown. Then when he fought through it, he came out smelling like roses.”\n\nThe buzz surrounding James reached the national stage — especially with STVM playing in several other states — yet people from Akron knew about it on a deeper level.\n\nThe vast majority of the St. Vincent-St. Mary home games during LeBron's junior and senior seasons were moved to the University of Akron's Rhodes Arena to accommodate larger crowds. In his final high school season (2002-03), the Irish's games could be purchased by Northeast Ohio residents through pay-per-view. Two games were televised on ESPN2.\n\nKent State star eyeing NBA:Sincere Carry honored again for prowess in basketball, a game he once gave up\n\nMeanwhile, shoe companies Nike and Adidas were courting James for endorsement deals, with Reebok entering the fray shortly before the NBA Draft. The seven-year contract James eventually signed with Nike before he had ever played a minute for the Cavaliers was worth $90 million.\n\n“He was the league's face at 18, and he took that s*** on like it was nothing — like a champ,” Lane said. “That feat right there is unbelievable. I think that feat right there is more unbelievable than him breaking the scoring record.”\n\nJoyce explained a key to James overcoming the pressure heaped upon him at a young age could be found in his support system on the STVM roster.\n\nJoyce first coached James as a 10-year-old AAU player. The coach's oldest son, Dru Joyce III, and Sian Cotton were members of the same AAU team. They would later unite with Willie McGee and Romeo Travis to form STVM's “Fab Five” with James as the headliner. Those former STVM standouts attended Tuesday's game along with other loved ones of James.\n\n“What a lot of people don't realize is the significance of his friends and his teammates because they kept him grounded for those years,” Joyce said. “He was never treated differently by me or any of those close friends on the team. We recognized he was the best player, but we also recognized you can't do anything without us. He recognized he can't do anything without the team.\n\n“When I see him play today and I see him make the pass when others say he should have been more selfish and taken that shot, that just does my heart good. Because that's how we brought him up — to understand that the game is five on five, and you've got to trust your teammates, and they've got to trust you to make it work.”\n\nHow LeBron James has evolved as a basketball player en route to the NBA's all-time scoring record\n\nIn an interview last month with ESPN, the man nicknamed “King James” said sitting atop the scoring throne had never been a goal of his because he's always been “a pass-first guy.” Last week, James moved into the fourth spot on the NBA's all-time assists list.\n\nHowever, LeBron's game has also changed with time. The 6-foot-9 James is more of a post presence nowadays than the wingman he had been for years.\n\n“He's continued to figure out ways to get better and sustain a high level of play,” said Pelicans guard CJ McCollum, a Canton native and GlenOak High School graduate. “Obviously, his jump shot has improved since his younger years, and his athleticism is still there after 20 years. It's crazy.\n\n“But I think his basketball IQ, his ability to manipulate a game, make the players around him better and almost be a coach on the floor is impressive. For him to sustain that level of play for so long just shows you how great he truly is and how much he takes care of his body and does the little things to make sure he gets the best out of himself.”\n\nSTVM's Malaki Branham living NBA dream:St. Vincent-St. Mary High School graduate reflects on journey to pro basketball: 'It's going to get a little emotional'\n\nJames' career regular-season averages are 27.2 points on 50.5% shooting from the field, 7.5 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game. He's still dominant this season, scoring 30.2 points, grabbing 8.5 rebounds and dishing out 7 assists a game.\n\n“First, he used to just drive a lot, and then he picked up a little jumper. Now he picked up 3s,” Nance Sr. said. “He just evolved his game and got better each year, and that's the sign of a superstar — to be able to look at my weaknesses and develop them and make myself better. I've seen him play with pretty much a broken right hand and still average 28. I mean, he just doesn't take no for an answer. He's going to figure out how to do it, and he's one of the most unstoppable people I've ever seen.”\n\nLarry Nance Jr. and CJ McCollum unite:For New Orleans Pelicans teammates with Northeast Ohio ties, it's '330 vs. everybody'\n\nThe determination of James caused Joyce to chuckle when he reflected on his former pupil insisting the scoring record wasn't a target.\n\n“This has just happened, but it's just happened because of his desire to be the best,” said Joyce, who has led STVM to seven state titles as a head coach. “That just kind of goes along with the territory. You can't be the best and not score the ball.\n\n“I used to tell him, 'Hey, you speak your reality into existence. Don't be afraid to say what you believe, and then you've got to work at it. But you can't be afraid to say I want to be the greatest.' He said it, and he understands that saying it isn't enough. There's work involved, and his work ethic is one of the best ever.”\n\nSTVM names locker room after coach:Late Irish assistant Illya McGee honored by basketball program\n\nCavaliers forward Cedi Osman witnessed the work ethic as a rookie in Cleveland during the 2017-18 season, James' last in his second stint with his hometown NBA team.\n\n“He would be the first one coming into the gym and the last one leaving,” Osman said. “He's a great example.”\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar held the top spot on the NBA's career regular-season scoring list for nearly 39 years\n\nA 19-time All Star and six-time NBA champion, Abdul-Jabbar set the career regular-season scoring record in his 15th season when he passed Wilt Chamberlain on April 5, 1984, nearly nine months before James was born at Akron City Hospital.\n\nAbdul-Jabbar played five more seasons and retired in 1989 at the age of 42. He logged 20 seasons — six with the Milwaukee Bucks and his last 14 with the Lakers — and 1,560 regular-season games.\n\nIt took James 1,410 regular-season games to pass Abdul-Jabbar, whose career averages were 24.6 points on 55.9% shooting from the field, 11.2 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game.\n\nNance Sr. and Lane played against Abdul-Jabbar and encountered his signature offensive move.\n\n“Kareem's skyhook is the prettiest shot I've ever seen,” said Nance Sr., who added Abdul-Jabbar was a “classy” opponent and among his favorite players. “He could shoot that thing from 15 feet out, just like a jump shot.\n\n“I had a jump hook. I don't think anybody could throw it as smooth and pretty as Kareem. I definitely tried to pick up on a hook because, to me, it's one of the most dominant shots in the history of the NBA that nobody could really block. You've seen guys try to throw hooks, but nothing like his.”\n\nMore from the Akron basketball scene:TikTok star Mylan Murphy aims to motivate, inspire this holiday season\n\nLane called the 7-2 Abdul-Jabbar “very physical” and “strong as hell.” At 6-6, Lane said, “No way I was getting near that skyhook. All I could do is once he did the skyhook is block him out and hope he missed.”\n\nPlenty of players who have tried to guard James will have stories to tell for generations, too.\n\n“Even his rookie year, he was killing it, and he's killing it now,” Osman said. “I think every year, he just got better. On the level he plays right now, it's unbelievable. He's a great inspiration.”\n\nLeBron's former teammate coaching STVM:Former Akron standout Romeo Travis emerging as Dru Joyce II’s St. Vincent-St. Mary heir\n\nLane wonders whether James will be knocked out of the No. 1 spot on the all-time scoring list, considering he appears to have several years of elite production left.\n\n“He's going to add on so much that it's going to be really hard to get,” Lane said.\n\nNo matter how it shakes out, no one can deny James has lived up to his billing and then some.\n\n“It's unbelievable. If you wrote it in a book, it'd be like, 'Nah, it's too corny. I can't read that,'” Nance Jr. said. “The dude is incredible. The things he's had to overcome and the way he's given back to the community all while doing it with an unscathed resume and just being the utmost role model is to be commended.\n\n“I don't think it's talked about enough, but the dude is as good off the court as he is on, and we know how good he is on, so that's something to be said. It was an honor of my career getting to play with him.”\n\nNow Nance Jr. is among those who can say they shared a court with the new scoring king.\n\nNate Ulrich can be reached at nulrich@thebeaconjournal.com.\n\nOn Twitter: @ByNateUlrich.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/sport/steph-curry-warriors-grizzlies-celtics-bucks-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Steph Curry makes history as Warriors stage late comeback to beat ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSteph Curry became the first player in NBA history to make 500 career playoff threes as he poured in 32 points to go along with eight assists to help the Golden State Warriors defeat the Memphis Grizzlies 101-98 on Monday and move to within one win of the Western Conference finals.\n\nAn out-of-sorts Warriors reeled in the Ja Morant-less Grizzlies, taking their first lead of the night with 45.7 seconds remaining to close out victory and take a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series.\n\nCurry scored 18 points in the final quarter, tying the game at 90 with 3:25 to go, and then netted eight straight clutch free throws in the final minute, edging his team ahead.\n\n“Nothing we figured out, it was just don’t let the first three quarters influence the fact that we still had a chance to win the game,” Curry told reporters after the game. “Shoot the shots you think you can make, play aggressive, take care of the ball. We did all of those things.”\n\nGolden State’s task had been made more challenging by the absence of coach Steve Kerr, who tested positive for Covid-19 two hours before tip-off and was unable to take his seat on the bench.\n\nHis spot was taken by assistant coach Mike Brown, who is taking over as Sacramento Kings head coach next season and had previously led the Warriors to an 11-0 record during the 2017 title run when Kerr was absent.\n\n“His head coaching record for a Warrior playoff game I think is undefeated,” Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. “We did miss Steve a lot, just his voice, his presence, but we’ve been here before, 2017 when Mike took over and we rolled off a lot of wins, so I reflected on that a lot.”\n\nMike Brown coached the Warriors in the absence of Steve Kerr who tested positive for Covid-19. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nBoth teams missed chances to pull away due to their poor shooting, with neither team hitting 42% from the floor or 26% from beyond the arc.\n\nThe Warriors were 0-15 from deep until Otto Porter Jr. drained a three with 3:24 left in the second quarter. Thompson missed all seven of his three-point attempts but still contributed 14 points and seven rebounds.\n\nThe Grizzlies’ defense – led by Jaren Jackson Jr. who blocked five shots and had two steals – shut down the Warriors’ offense, holding them to just 38 points in the first half.\n\nJackson Jr. also led Memphis with 21 points in the absence of star point guard Morant who injured his right knee during Saturday’s Game 3 loss. Tyus Jones added 19 points, six rebounds and five assists.\n\n“It’s a tough one. It’s a tough pill to swallow. It felt like we were leading the whole game,” Jones told the media postgame. “It felt like we were in a good position. It felt like we put ourselves in a good position to win a ballgame and things didn’t go our way down the stretch.”\n\nGame 5 is scheduled for Wednesday in Memphis.\n\nCeltics level series against the Bucks 2-2\n\nIn the Eastern Conference, Al Horford scored a postseason career-best 30 points as the Boston Celtics produced a devastating late scoring flurry to down the Milwaukee Bucks 116-108 and level their best-of-seven series at two games a piece.\n\n“I usually just kind of go about my business,” Horford said to the media after the game. “I do get excited, but I guess you kind of pick your spots, your moments. This was an emotional game.”\n\nAl Horford led his side to a 116-108 victory. Morry Gash/AP\n\nDespite trailing by 11 points midway through the third quarter, the Celtics rallied with a 10-0 scoring run to drag themselves back into contention before outscoring the Bucks 43-28 in the fourth quarter.\n\nMilwaukee regained the lead 94-92 with 6:02 remaining, but the Celtics responded with a 14-2 run that put the game beyond the Bucks’ reach.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo led the scoring for Milwaukee with 34 points in a losing effort, along with 18 rebounds and five assists, while Brook Lopez finished with 17 points and seven rebounds.\n\n“Al [Horford] had a hell of a game,” said Milwaukee’s Jrue Holiday, who had 16 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. “I think we came down and had some shots we usually make, and we couldn’t finish those. But give them credit. They made more plays.”\n\nThe Celtics have home advantage in two of the next three games in their series.

Next week, her legal team will appeal the decision to the Moscow region court.\n\n“We want to continue to use our platform and the opportunity to shout out a very special member of the basketball community. Brittney Griner’s birthday is today, she’s 32,” Curry told the crowd.\n\n“We want to continue to let her name be known and we pray. It’s been 243 days since she was wrongfully incarcerated in Russia. We hope that she comes home soon, that everybody’s doing their part to get her home.”\n\nThe rings which the Warriors team received were crafted with minute specifications to specifically commemorate last season’s success.\n\nCurry inspects his championship ring during a ceremony prior to the game against the Lakers.

He also denied allegations that he kissed or inappropriately touched a student.\n\n“Professor Comaroff is not only a leading scholar in his field – he is a deeply caring person who has devoted his energy for decades to mentoring and advancing generations of students,” the statement reads. “Attacks on his career based on gossip and fantasy rather than actual evidence are shameful.”\n\nUniversity ignored misconduct of star faculty, lawsuit says\n\nThe lawsuit states that Mandava and Czerwienski informed faculty about Comaroff in the spring of 2017 after learning that a second-year graduate student, one of Comaroff’s advisees, told them about nonconsensual interactions she allegedly had with the professor.\n\nThe advisee reported the harassment to Harvard’s Title IX office, but the lawsuit alleges that the university chose not to investigate the reports.\n\nComaroff denies that he made advances on an unnamed second-year graduate student. His attorneys also stated that “no such student has ever sought an investigation of claims against him” and that Harvard never notified him of any such complaint.\n\nMandava also informed a faculty member that Comaroff had shown her unwanted sexual attention when she was a student at the University of Chicago and he was a professor there, the lawsuit says.\n\nIn addition to denying the allegation, Comaroff’s attorneys said in a statement that he was never subject of any Title IX or other complaints while at the University of Chicago and was a “sincerely devoted mentor to countless students.”\n\nThe University of Chicago said it could not share details about specific cases for privacy reasons, but told CNN that it is “committed to addressing and preventing incidents of unlawful harassment and sexual misconduct and makes substantial efforts to respond in a prompt, equitable and thorough manner whenever allegations occur.”\n\nWhen Mandava met with Comaroff in October 2017 about a grant application, the lawsuit says, Comaroff allegedly threatened to retaliate against her and Czerwienski if they didn’t stop “spreading ‘nasty rumors’ about his sexual misconduct with students.” Comaroff, however, in a statement through his attorneys, “absolutely denies threatening Ms. Mandava or Ms. Czerwienski, during that meeting or at any other time.” The statement adds that “he was not even aware, during that meeting, of the rumors that the two were spreading about him.” Instead, according to the professor’s attorneys, he was offering general advice about the dangers of gossip in professional academic settings, which he says was relevant to Mandava’s academic topic.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, when Czerwienski reported Comaroff’s alleged threats to the university’s Title IX resource coordinator, the coordinator allegedly discouraged her “from filing a formal report with Harvard’s Office for Dispute Resolution (“ODR”) because, he said, doing so would be futile.”\n\nComaroff kissed Kilburn without her consent when she visited the Harvard campus in February of 2017, before she was even attending the school, the lawsuit alleges. After she started attending the university, she allegedly faced sexual harassment from Comaroff during the two years they worked together. Some of the accusations in the lawsuit include overly tight hugs, forced kissing and squeezing her upper thigh.\n\n“Regarding Ms. Kilburn, Professor Comaroff did not kiss her or touch her inappropriately at any time. Harvard’s Title IX investigation, which lasted over a year and was extraordinarily thorough, concluded that the evidence simply did not support claims that he had kissed or touched Ms. Kilburn,” attorneys for Comaroff said in the statement.\n\nIn addition, Comaroff allegedly told Kilburn during a meeting about her dissertation topic, which was focused on Central Africa, that she would be raped and killed in South Africa because she had a same-sex partner, the lawsuit says.\n\nThe comments about the potential risk of sexual violence from her plan to travel openly in Cameroon with her partner were part of “a necessary conversation for her safety,” Comaroff’s attorneys said.\n\n“Harvard’s deliberate indifference allowed Professor Comaroff to repeatedly and forcibly kiss Ms. Kilburn, grope her in public, imagine aloud her rape and murder, cut her off from other professors, and derail her academic trajectory,” the lawsuit reads. “It also allowed Professor Comaroff to threaten Ms. Mandava and Ms. Czerwienski, poison their reputations in their fields of study, and upend their careers.”\n\nThe lawsuit also argues that Harvard ignored warnings from a faculty member at the University of Chicago while they were in the process of hiring Comaroff.\n\nHe allegedly had a reputation with graduate students and faculty as being a “predator” and a “groomer” over his 20 years at the university, the lawsuit says.\n\nComaroff allegedly had similar incidents of inappropriate comments and groping, according to the lawsuit, and threatened at least one graduate student with lack of career support after she shared her experience with another student.\n\nIt’s also alleged in the lawsuit that an unnamed University of Chicago faculty member warned the chair of Harvard’s Department of African and African American Studies of Comaroff’s alleged conduct. The lawsuit doesn’t say if other Harvard administrators were aware of the discussion.\n\nAfter a lengthy investigation, the Office of Dispute Resolution ultimately found that the comments about Kilburn being raped and killed constituted “severe” sexual harassment, according to the lawsuit. Harvard also told CNN that Comaroff “engaged in verbal conduct” in violation of the school’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy and the Professional Conduct Policy.\n\nBut the lawsuit says that, with respect to the other allegations of sexual harassment and abuse toward Kilburn and the retaliation claimed by Mandava and Czerwienski, investigators concluded that Comaroff had not violated Harvard’s Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment Policy regarding these claims.\n\nAfter Mandava, Czerwienski and Kilburn appealed, an appeal board held up the ODR decision and said, according to the lawsuit, that no “procedural violation occurred.”\n\nIn response to the university’s findings as to Mandava and Czerwienski’s allegations, the statement from Comaroff’s attorneys reiterates that “Harvard’s thorough Title IX investigation found that not only had he not retaliated against either student,” and added that he “consistently made every effort to assist these students and to advance their careers.”\n\nIn response to the university’s findings as to Kilburn’s allegations, a statement to CNN from Comaroff’s attorneys reiterates that “Harvard’s Title IX investigation, which lasted over a year and was extraordinarily thorough, concluded that the evidence simply did not support claims that he had kissed or touched Ms. Kilburn.” The statement adds that, with respect to his comments to her about her travel plans in Africa with her same-sex partner, numerous faculty witnesses testified to investigators that his advice was appropriate and investigators “found that he was motivated only by concern for Ms. Kilburn’s well-being and had no romantic or sexual intention.” Harvard’s Title IX investigators still concluded that the comments constituted sexual harassment, a conclusion he “vehemently disputes.”\n\nIn a letter provided to CNN, Dean Claudine Gay announced to students on January 20 that Comaroff had been placed on unpaid administrative leave for the spring semester and was not allowed to teach required courses for the 2022-2023 academic year. He is also not allowed to take on any additional graduate students, advise graduate students who do not have at least one other co-adviser or chair a dissertation committee for the 2022-2023 academic year as well, according to the letter. Current graduate students who have Comaroff as an adviser will be able to switch, the school added.\n\nGay will decide how to proceed after the end of this time period, she said.\n\nRoadblocks to reporting abuse\n\nIn the process of reporting Comaroff’s alleged abuse to Harvard University, the lawsuit says the three anthropology students faced continuous roadblocks from school administration.\n\nAccording to the women, the school’s Title IX office either discouraged them from filing reports or didn’t take substantive action in stopping the alleged conduct. Professors they confided in frequently didn’t report what they were told, the women allege, mostly because of misunderstanding the mandatory reporting process.\n\nWhile Comaroff’s advisee and Kilburn complained to the Title IX office in 2017 and 2019 respectively about the alleged sexual abuse, and Czerwienski complained to the office in 2017 about Comaroff’s threats of retaliation, the lawsuit says that the office said Kilburn, Czerwienski and Mandava only formally submitted complaints in 2020.\n\nDuring the actual investigation by the school’s ODR, the lawsuit says that Comaroff used professors and academic figures that were important to Kilburn to testify as part of his defense. This was an attempt by Comaroff to retaliate against the women and ruin potential career contacts for them, the lawsuit says.\n\nComaroff’s attorneys told CNN that allegations that Comaroff attempted to harm Kilburn’s career are “entirely false,” and that any professors or academics he suggested as witnesses were relevant to the case. The individuals that were called had relevant experience or information in the areas Kilburn wanted to travel to, they continued, and could give relevant context on the situation. The attorneys also said that the people who testified “do not work on the same academic topics as Ms. Kilburn and would never have been feasible advisers for her,” and that she never expressed interest in working with them while Comaroff was her adviser.\n\nAt no time did Comaroff share the identity of the students with those testifying, the attorneys said.\n\nODR also allegedly got notes from Kilburn’s therapy sessions without her permission and then withheld the full notes from her and included a redacted version in the final report, according to the lawsuit.\n\nODR does not contact a person’s medical provider during investigations unless they indicated there is relevant information they want their office to consider, the university said, and only accesses it with the person’s permission. They also added that their office relies on providers to obtain necessary HIPPA-compliant permission from their clients. A party has a right not to have ODR consider documents in a case and is able to see what is included in versions of the draft report, according to the university.", "authors": ["Taylor Romine"], "publish_date": "2022/02/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/politics/college-costs-government-accountability-office-report/index.html", "title": "91% of colleges don't provide students with the accurate cost ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAn independent federal agency is calling on Congress to help prevent college students from taking on an unaffordable amount of student debt.\n\nCongress should require colleges to give students an accurate price for the cost of attendance, the Government Accountability Office said in a recent report that found that most colleges fail to provide all the financial information students need.\n\nThe report comes as President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program, which would deliver up to $20,000 in debt cancellation for millions of borrowers, remains blocked by federal courts.\n\nProspective college students usually receive a financial aid letter from schools once they are accepted. The letter lists costs as well as grant awards and federal loans for which the student is eligible.\n\nBut these letters are far from straightforward and have long been criticized as being unnecessarily complicated.\n\nAccording to the government’s best practices, colleges should estimate the net price – how much a student will pay to attend a particular school – by deducting only grants and scholarships from all costs like tuition, books, housing and meals. But about 91% of colleges understate or don’t include the net price at all in their letters.\n\n“Federal law doesn’t require colleges to include clear, standard information in all of their financial aid offers. Congress should consider mandating that colleges do so,” the GAO said.\n\nCurrently, the Department of Education encourages colleges to follow some best practices – but adoption has been limited, according to the report.\n\nOne of the big problems with many financial aid letters is that they subtract federal loans (money students will have to pay back with interest) from the total cost, making the price look lower than it is – and lumping the loans together with financial aid a student doesn’t have to pay back, like grants. Some letters also subtract potential earnings from federal work-study – which is not guaranteed since students must apply for those jobs – from the total cost.\n\nAnother big problem is that some letters don’t include indirect costs, like housing and food, which can sometimes be more expensive than tuition.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx, a Republican, had asked the GAO to do the review and called the results “egregious and unacceptable.”\n\nFoxx and Rep. Lisa McClain, a Republican from Michigan, introduced legislation last week that would establish certain requirements for college financial aid offers.\n\nThe bill is one of many legislative efforts that aim to provide students and their families better information about the cost of college. Many of these bills, like the Understanding the True Cost of College Act, have bipartisan support but have so far failed to pass Congress.\n\nFoxx, GOP leader of the House Education and Labor Committee, has been critical of Biden’s proposed student loan forgiveness program – which, she argues will do nothing to address college costs while shifting the $400 billion cost of debt relief to taxpayers. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by June on whether the program is legal.\n\nBiden has proposed making community college free, but he can’t do that on his own and legislation to fund the initiative failed to pass Congress when it came up for a vote last year. But lawmakers did approve a $400 increase to the maximum federal Pell grant for low-income students, raising it to $6,895 a year.\n\nThe Biden administration has made it easier for certain borrowers to get debt relief. Officials have expanded the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and streamlined the process for students who were defrauded by their for-profit college or are permanently disabled to receive student loan relief for which they have long been eligible.\n\nIn addition, last month, the Department of Justice released new guidance that aims to make it easier to have federal student loan debt discharged in bankruptcy – a particularly difficult legal process under the previous policy.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/04/opinions/nyu-chemistry-professor-student-complaint-filipovic/index.html", "title": "Opinion: This fired chemistry professor's example shows what's ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and author of the book “OK Boomer, Let’s Talk: How My Generation Got Left Behind.” Follow her on Twitter.

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe dismissal of a renowned chemistry professor from NYU after a spate of student complaints about his teaching has reinvigorated a series of long-standing questions about the modern academy: Are academic standards dropping? Are professors and administrators too beholden to students’ fragile emotions – and their parents’ tuition dollars? And what’s wrong with kids these days, anyway?\n\nJill Filipovic Courtesy Jill Filipovic\n\nThe basic outline is this: According to an article in the New York Times, Maitland Jones Jr. is one of the nation’s top organic chemistry professors. He was tenured at Princeton, wrote an influential textbook, retired and went on to teach at NYU on an annual contract basis, where he won awards for his teaching.\n\nThis year, though, he was sacked – after 82 of the 350 students in his course signed a petition because, they said, their low scores demonstrated that his class was too hard. A spokesman for the university told the Times in defense of their decision to terminate Jones’s contract that the professor had been the target of complaints about “dismissiveness, unresponsiveness, condescension and opacity about grading. It’s worth noting that according to the Times, students expressed surprise that Jones was fired, which their petition did not call for. (Full disclosure: I was an adjunct in the NYU journalism department in the Spring 2022 semester).\n\nFor his part, Jones says that he noticed a decline in student ability about a decade ago. He made his exams easier; an unusual number of students still did poorly on them. Then, the pandemic hit. “In the last two years, they fell off a cliff,” Jones wrote in a grievance letter to NYU. “We now see single digit scores and even zeros.”\n\nJones isn’t alone in observing this dynamic. A great many experts in education have observed and quantified grade inflation and lowered academic standards. And the pandemic does seem to have turbocharged existing problems, while creating brand-new ones. Remote learning was a spectacular failure.\n\nStudents who completed their high school years during the pandemic, Jones observed in the Times report, seem to have no idea how to study. And some of the student complaints laid out in the petition might strike those of us who went to college in the Before Times as a bit unrealistic: They noted that Jones did not offer extra credit and that he did not make his lectures available via Zoom.\n\nJones was also, according to some students, harsh, sarcastic and dismissive; he did not seem to be the kind of professor who went out of his way to help struggling students, expecting them instead to work as hard as necessary to meet his exacting expectation. Student evaluations of his course were predictably low, the university said.\n\nThere has been a shift in the past decades toward a more student-centered learning experience, and that’s a good thing. Harsh grading practices simply for the sake of it do not align with the goal of any educational institution, which should be to help students learn. It sounds like Jones was unnecessarily harsh on students, and that the university had what was perhaps a missed opportunity to work with him to improve both his interactions with students and their performance.\n\nAnd with many more young people going to college and the stakes so much higher – income gaps between those with a college education and those without are striking and elite colleges in particular are seen by many as a tried-and-true pathway to financial wellbeing – it makes sense that a more-competitive educational environment has produced many more high-achieving students at institutions like NYU.\n\nBut as students have become more academically successful, there is also some evidence that they have become less resilient, more anxious and less able to cope with life setbacks – like failing organic chemistry.\n\nIn a vacuum, this case is perhaps not such a big deal. Jones told the Times that he doesn’t want his job back. His position was far different from many non-tenured or non-tenure-track scholars these days at universities that increasingly rely on contingent adjunct labor. Jones, by contrast, spent a career as a tenured professor and likely wasn’t teaching out of financial necessity. And one has to imagine that if a newer female professor who did not have Jones’s clout received such abysmal student evaluations, she would have been cut loose long ago.\n\nBut this case nonetheless raises important questions, chief among them how much power students, who universities seem to increasingly think of as consumers (and some of whom think of themselves that way), should have in the hiring, retention and firing of professors. Many studies, for example, have found that students hold female professors to higher standards than male ones, giving them worse evaluations for the same performance. Professors of color are similarly penalized.\n\nAnd NYU seems to have given away the game when Marc A. Walters, the director of undergraduate studies in the chemistry department, wrote an email to Jones before his firing. Quoting from that email, the Times said that Walters explained to Jones that a plan allowing students to have their grades reviewed or to withdraw retroactively from his class was a way to “extend a gentle but firm hand to the students and those who pay the tuition bills.”\n\nThere are real consequences, though, to making higher education primarily palatable to those paying tuition bills – particularly when it comes to courses like organic chemistry, which are intended to be difficult. Future medical students do in fact need a rigorous science background in order to be successful doctors someday. Whether or not Jones was an effective teacher for aspiring medical students is up for debate, but in firing him, NYU is effectively dodging questions about the line between academic rigor and student well-being with potentially life-and-death matters at stake.\n\nStudents shouldn’t have to feel unmitigated stress or despair over their academic fates and what their grades mean for their futures, nor should their feelings determine their grades or their instructor’s job security. Guiding students and faculty through the difficult terrain between those realities is the job of the university itself, and in firing Jones, NYU has shirked that duty.\n\nTurning education into a consumer product rather than a public good also subjects educators to the whims of the consuming public. At elite and largely left-wing universities like NYU, populated by students who are used to getting straight As in high school, that may manifest as dissatisfaction with lackluster grades.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nBut at many other institutions across the US, treating education as a consumer product very well may result in even greater scrutiny of what educators are teaching, impinging on academic freedom. We’re already seeing conservative book bans and demands for teachers to hew to a right-wing worldview in the classroom. College administrators who fold to student complaint or the fear of parental demands only increase the risk that the professors they employ will not be able to do their jobs fully and appropriately and freely.\n\nThe role of a university is indeed to help its students learn, and in this case, it sounds like there is much NYU could have done differently. But students are not helped by universities that cave to parental pressure because parents are the ones writing the tuition checks, and they expect their child to get into med school. Doing so sets up a dangerous precedent for academic freedom, particularly for middle-of-the-road public universities in conservative states, who don’t have the freedom or elite status of private ones. And accommodating parental demands above academic rigor doesn’t help students in the long term, either – it may help them get good grades, but it also sets back their transition into adulthood.", "authors": ["Jill Filipovic"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/11/us/unh-fraternity-hazing-charges/index.html", "title": "46 University of New Hampshire fraternity members issued arrest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nArrest warrants have been issued for 46 members of a fraternity at the University of New Hampshire, accusing them of student hazing at an event in April, police said this week.\n\nThe university’s Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) chapter was suspended over the allegations, which were reported to the school by the fraternity’s national organization, the school has said.\n\nHazing is suspected to have happened at the university’s SAE chapter house on April 13, at an event involving new members, police in the university’s host town of Durham said in a news release.\n\nWarrants were issued for 46 SAE members on Tuesday, and 10 of them were arrested by Friday at 2 p.m., police said.

Its impact has been felt far, wide and deep − and it's not over.\n\nIt's a conflict that has upended life for Israelis and Palestinians; caused death, suffering and destruction on a massive scale; further polarized long divided views; reshaped the dynamics of the Middle East; and stirred international political and emotional turmoil. It has even threatened to impact the 2024 U.S. election.\n\nHere are some of the storylines, defining moments, devastating impacts and still-emerging developments connected to a war that has shocked, angered, dominated, surprised, confused and moved many of us.\n\nHow it unfolded\n\nJust before 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas fired thousands of rockets as it attacked Israel by air, land and sea. Hamas fighters stormed dozens of communities along Israel's southern border with the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian enclave, murdering at least 1,200 people and kidnapping 240 others, who were taken back to Gaza.\n\nHamas' attack was a massacre. Among those killed on Oct. 7 was Cindy Flash, 67, an American mom originally from St. Paul, Minnesota. Flash had spent a lifetime advocating for the rights of Palestinians.\n\nHow Israel reacted\n\nWithin hours of the attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered retaliatory airstrikes on Gaza, 140 square miles of relatively flat coastal plain bordering Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. About a week later, Israel told residents in northern Gaza to evacuate south. Many in Gaza said they simply had nowhere to go.\n\nMore than three months since the start of Israel's bombardment, at least 24,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, which is run by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe context on the context\n\nWhen Hamas infiltrated Israeli territory on Oct. 7 it was the U.S.-designated terrorist group's biggest offensive against Israel in years. It was also part of a complex, bitter conflict between Israelis and Palestinians over culture, identity and land that reaches back to World War I and is also rooted in pre-biblical times.\n\nThe brutality of Hamas' attacks on civilians -- and the fact that Hamas still has not released all its hostages -- has made it difficult for many Israelis to focus on anything beyond the atrocities. For Palestinians, the scale of Israel's killings of civilians, combined with their long sense of persecution by Israel's military and loss of land to Israeli settlers, has made it challenging for them to criticize Hamas.\n\nThe struggle to bury the dead\n\nIn Israel, the authorities and volunteer emergency responders went to great lengths to recover bodies they discovered in scenes of unspeakable horror, often in places where fighting was still taking place. In some cases, remains were charred and mutilated so badly identification was problematic.\n\nIn Gaza, large swathes of which lay in ruin due to Israel's bombing campaign, families resorted to makeshift graveyards dug in empty lots and health workers stored bodies in ice cream freezers as morgues filled up. As of mid-Jan., the Palestinian Ministry of Health estimates that about 7,000 people are still missing under rubble.\n\nHostages and prisoners\n\nHamas released a first group of hostages on Nov. 24, 2023. The release was part of a deal with Israel that included a temporary cease-fire in Gaza. As part of the agreement, Israel agreed to free 240 Palestinian prisoners, accused of offenses ranging from throwing stones to attempted murder, from Israeli jails.\n\nThe truce lasted seven days. More than 100 hostages were released by Hamas during this time, the majority of them Israeli women and children, but also foreign nationals, some of whom hold dual citizenship. Four Americans were freed. An estimated 129 hostages, including up to six Americans, are still held in Gaza.\n\nParts of Gaza look like a wasteland\n\nOne hundred days into the war, thousands of lives have been lost and countless families torn apart. In Gaza, hundreds of thousands have been displaced and face, the U.N. says, acute shortages of food and medicines. As temperatures plummet, many families are sleeping outside, and infectious disease is spreading.\n\nIsrael's bombardment has crumpled residential apartment buildings. It has leveled entire neighborhoods. Once bustling urban areas lie in ruins, with roads and many public areas transformed into wastelands.\n\nIs Israel guilty of war crimes?\n\nU.N. officials have said they believe both Israel and Hamas have committed war crimes.\n\nLegal experts have for decades argued about what constitutes a war crime based on the Geneva Conventions and other international laws and policies. This involves knotty questions about proportionality, including how and when the killings of civilians can be justified, and what constitutes a protected site.\n\nIsrael says it is abiding by globally recognized rules of armed conflict in Gaza, even though it has bombed hospitals, residential buildings and other civilian targets there. But Palestinians, U.N. officials and a growing chorus of international experts − including some former U.S. government war crimes officials − say Israel's bombing of civilian areas is a clear violation of the internationally recognized rules of armed conflict.\n\nSouth Africa has asked the International Court of Justice to consider whether Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nHow it tore us apart\n\nIn the U.S. and across the world, the Israel-Hamas war has tested friendships, families and colleagues who have differing opinions, world views and degrees of connective tissue to Israeli and Palestinian issues. For many, it's been hard to talk about the conflict without devolving into heated disagreements.\n\nAll kinds of community group texts have unraveled because no one can agree; millennials have walked on eggshells for fear of upsetting their Gen Z partners. Reported incidents of hate crimes and discrimination, with Jews and Muslims and their supporters often the victims, have risen in many cities.\n\nDeath by journalism\n\nThe war has exacted a huge toll on journalists in Gaza. In fact, it's been the deadliest period since the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists began recording such data in 1992. As of Jan. 8, 2024, at least 79 journalists and media workers were among the more than 23,000 killed since the war began.\n\nTareq Hajjaj, 30, the Gaza correspondent for Mondoweiss, a news and opinion website, is among those who has been attempting to report in apocalyptic conditions while also trying to take care of his family and stay alive.\n\nWar on the American campus\n\nColleges and universities across the U.S. have struggled with the tense debate and protests over the war, which has put a spotlight on antisemitism, anti-Muslim harassment, free speech and campus safety.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania’s president, Elizabeth Magill, and Harvard President Claudine Gay, resigned after participating in a congressional hearing over their response to antisemitism on their campuses.\n\nSexual violence horror\n\nIsraeli volunteers and first responders who collected and helped identify the bodies of those killed by Hamas on Oct. 7 said they observed multiple signs of obvious and incontestable sexual assault on some victims.\n\nBut sexual assault appears not to have been confined to Oct. 7. Two Israeli doctors, who have been treating released hostages, and an Israeli military official familiar with the matter, confirmed to USA TODAY that some released hostages revealed they suffered violent sexual assaults in captivity.\n\nWidening international flashpoints\n\nIran, Houthi rebels in Yemen and the Hezbollah militant in Lebanon have all vowed to come to the aid of Hamas as its fighters and leaders are hunted by Israel in Gaza and Palestinian civilian deaths have hit unprecedented levels. As the war has ground on, the U.S. has bolstered its naval presence in the Mediterranean Sea as it has sought to contain the conflict from spilling over into a wider regional war.\n\nBut the risks appear to be escalating.\n\nOn Jan. 12, U.S. warplanes, ships and submarines along with British fighters attacked sites in Yemen associated Houthi rebels who, like Hezbollah, are backed Iran. Houthis have been firing dozens of drones and missiles into Red Sea shipping lanes. Meanwhile, though it hasn't confirmed it, Israel is suspected of killing a senior Hamas militant in an airstrike in Beirut in early Jan. while Hezbollah has fired barrages of rockets into Israel.\n\nPotential impact on 2024\n\nOver the last few months, President Joe Biden has been getting increasingly squeezed within his own party by those who want him to stand strong behind Israel after the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust and those warning that the Palestinian people are at risk of annihilation.\n\nPolls have shown a drop in support for Biden among Democrats and among Arab Americans since Oct. 7. \"There will be many people who simply will not vote for Biden because of his strong pro-Israel stance, and they were previously reliable Biden voters,\" said Max Abrahms, a political scientist at Northeastern University in Boston.\n\nWhat is Gaza's future?\n\nIsrael has vowed to wage its war in Gaza until it has completely rooted out Hamas. It remains to be seen whether it will accomplish this. Still, once the weapons fall silent what should happen to Gaza? Who should rule it?\n\nMustafa Barghouti, a onetime Palestinian presidential candidate and the current leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, a West Bank political party, told USA Today's The Excerpt podcast that in his view there is only one realistic option: a national unity government.

Ilhan Omar: Who is the Muslim lawmaker Donald Trump has ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – “We are all Americans,” Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday after the president tweeted an inflammatory video about her last week. “This is endangering lives. It has to stop.”\n\nBut it hasn’t.\n\nMonday morning, President Donald Trump was complaining about Omar’s “anti-Semitic, anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements.”\n\n“She is out of control,” he tweeted.\n\nSince becoming one of the highest-profile, and most controversial, members of the House freshman class, Omar has sent a message that she will not be cowed – even as she’s apologized for some missteps.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"The Great State of Minnesota, where we don’t only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington,\" she tweeted at Trump as he traveled to her state Monday.\n\nBut she’s in unprecedented territory as the U.S. Capitol Police were ordered to conduct a \"security assessment\" to ensure her safety following Trump’s Friday tweet about a remark Omar made regarding the 9/11 terrorist attacks. She said \"some people did something\" in reference to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\nOmar said death threats against her have spiked as a result of Trump’s “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!” tweet above a video of Omar's remarks repeated along with ominous music, played over images of the World Trade Center engulfed in flames.\n\nThis month, a New York man was arrested for threatening Omar and saying he would \"put a bullet\" in her \"skull.\"\n\n\"She is strong. She is determined. She is also concerned,\" Rep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., told reporters Monday.\n\nOutsized attention\n\nEven before the recent controversy, Omar – along with Reps. Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – received an outsized share of the attention of the new members of Congress.\n\nThey represent the new voices, diversity and progressive energy of the Democratic class, celebrated in a February \"SNL\" skit on the “Women of Congress” that included all three lawmakers.\n\nPortrayed by a comic actress on \"Saturday Night Live\" as “Ilhan 'Get the hijab done’ Omar,” she was shown curling her biceps, scaling the side of a building with her bare hands and boasting about being a “proud Muslim woman and a proud American.”\n\n\"I think that’s a pretty accurate portrayal,\" said Andrew Johnson, a Minneapolis city council member whom Omar previously worked for as a policy aide and campaign manager. \"Ilhan is not somebody who is going to be told to keep quiet. She’s a strong, independent leader.\"\n\nBut Republicans have been quick to highlight her stumbles, hoping that helps them paint the Democratic Party as scary radicals.\n\n“House Dems have gone CrAzY!” the campaign arm of House Republicans said in one of the many criticisms of Omar and her cohorts unleashed earlier this year.\n\nTrump's previous attacks\n\nTrump had previously said Omar should resign from Congress or at least step down from the House Foreign Affairs Committee for comments that were criticized for “anti-Semitic tropes.”\n\n\"Her lame apology – and that's what it was; it was lame, and she didn’t mean a word of it – was just not appropriate,\" Trump said.\n\nOmar’s election was seen in part as a rebuke to Trump and his controversial order limiting travel into the United States from several countries – most of them majority-Muslim. After fleeing civil war-torn Somalia with her family when she was 8, Omar spent four years in a refugee camp before moving to the United States. She has said she gained her interest in politics from interpreting for her grandfather at Democratic-Farmer-Labor meetings in Minneapolis.\n\n“This new diversity creates some uncomfortableness,” Omar said in February during remarks on “reclaiming religious freedom” at the liberal Center for American Progress. “Oftentimes, as a society, when we are the most uncomfortable is when real shift happens.”\n\nLots of \"firsts\"\n\nBesides being one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, the Minnesotan is also the first to wear a hijab on the House floor and the first Somali-American and first naturalized citizen from Africa to serve in Congress.\n\n“People just add on extra 'firsts' that are not real,” Omar joked to host Trevor Noah in a recent appearance on \"The Daily Show.\"\n\nThat was not her first time on the show. She’d already received extensive media coverage, including a 2017 cover of Time magazine, before coming to Washington. The documentary “Time for Ilhan,” which premiered last year, chronicles the former community organizer’s 2016 election to the state legislature. She was not only the first Somali American elected to a state legislature, but she also beat one of her party's longest-serving members to win the nomination.\n\nJohnson, the Minneapolis city council member, said he knew she was unique when he first hired her to run his own campaign. It's only the speed at which she jumped onto the national stage that's been surprising.\n\n\"She was, and is, a reaction to Donald Trump,\" Johnson said. \"In many ways, the times picked her.\"\n\n\"This is what America looks like\"\n\nIn January, she signed a deal to publish a memoir entitled \"This is what America Looks Like.\"\n\nThat was also her response in December to conservative pastor and commentator E.W. Jackson, who complained that Congress “is now going to look like an Islamic republic” after Democrats lifted a ban on wearing head coverings on the House floor to accommodate Omar’s hijab.\n\n“Well sir, the floor of Congress is going to look like America,” she tweeted. “And you’re gonna have to just deal.”\n\nAt an event in January announcing the introduction of legislation to repeal Trump’s Muslim travel ban, Omar noted that she’s one of the few people in positions of power who are affected by the ban.\n\nAny legislation to block the ban that passes the Democratic-controlled House would likely get stopped in the GOP-controlled Senate. But Hoda Hawa, director of the Washington office of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said that Omar’s and Tlaib's elections to Congress show progress.\n\n“That, in itself, I would count as a success,” Hawa said.\n\nInterparty tensions\n\nOmar and Tlaib are both advocates for top progressive priorities such as a single-payer health care system and the Green New Deal unveiled by Ocasio-Cortez – fodder for the GOP campaign to cast them as socialists.\n\n“If you look at the new crop of Democrats, many of them are from purple districts. But the reality is that the more outspoken members of the new caucus are more progressive than your average new Democratic member,” said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon. “There’s going to be tension.”\n\nIn fact, more than two dozen Democrats – many from competitive districts – sent a letter to House leaders in February asking them to address and condemn \"recent anti-Semitic rhetoric.\"\n\nOmar and Tlaib were already under pressure for their pushback against Israel. Tlaib, who still has relatives in Palestine, wants to take lawmakers to the Israeli-occupied West Bank to counter regular trips to Israel paid for by the education arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nBoth Tlaib and Omar support applying economic pressure to change Israeli policy towards the Palestinian population.\n\n\"It's a little frustrating because those two get more press attention than everyone else combined,\" Ann Lewis, co-chair of the newly-formed Democratic Majority for Israel told The Forward in January.\n\nAnd that was long before Omar’s recent comments that prompted Trump’s tweeted video.\n\nPast apologies\n\nShe’d already apologized for tweeting in 2012 that Israel had “hypnotized the world,” her reaction to a resurgence of the longstanding conflict between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\nDemocratic leaders had stood by Omar, rejecting Republican charges of anti-Semitism. That changed when Omar tweeted in February about the influence of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in a way that fellow Democrats said used offensive anti-Semitic tropes and \"prejudicial accusations about Israel’s supporters.\"\n\n“It’s all about the Benjamins baby,” she tweeted.\n\nShe \"unequivocally apologized,\" but still reaffirmed \"the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry.\"\n\nThe fact that Omar apologized demonstrates that she realizes there’s a learning curve in terms of public discourse, said Peter Gottschalk, a religion professor at Wesleyan University who has written about Islamophobia.\n\n“There are Americans who are not as familiar with the themes and tropes of anti-Semitic comment that have long existed in this country,” he said, “just as there are Americans who not familiar enough with the themes and tropes of Islamophobic sentiment that has also existed for very long in this country.”\n\n9/11 comments\n\nLast week, conservatives sharply criticized Omar, for her “some people did something” reference to 9/11 when speaking at a March 23 Council on American-Islamic Relations event in Los Angeles.\n\nOmar's critics accused her of trivializing and minimizing the tragedy. Her defenders said those critics were ignoring the context of the speech in which she said Muslim Americans are treated as second-class citizens and have been punished collectively for the terrorist attacks committed by a small minority who share their faith.\n\nUnlike some of her past comments, Omar has nothing to apologize for in this instance, said Bass, the California congresswoman who heads the Congressional Black Caucus. She and other members of the caucus told reporters Monday that the party has Omar's back.\n\n\"There are always going to be a few who do not,\" said Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio. \"But the vast majority of us do stand with her.\"\n\nRefusing to be silenced\n\nOmar said her critics’ charge that she’s anti-American or “not an American first” is a \"dangerous incitement, given the death threats I face.\"\n\nWhile emphasizing that “We are ALL Americans!”, Omar also asserted: “I did not run for Congress to be silent.”\n\nWhen Omar appeared on \"The Daily Show,\" Noah asked her about whether there’s a fear that she, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez are troublemakers who are “here to cause chaos.”\n\n“Are you?” he asked.\n\nOmar responded that she and her colleagues are ready “to throw down on behalf of the American people.” And she appeared to enjoy the suggestion that she's threatening to some people.\n\n“They could hear us,\" she said, as the audience cheered, \"coming from afar.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/16/retiring-year-old-mississippis-bad-dam-snowplow-strike-news-around-states/41008603/", "title": "Retiring 102-year-old, Mississippi's bad dam: News from around our ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nCorrections & clarifications: A prior version of the Virginia item misstated the vote on updating the school dress code.

Kay Ivey is remaining uncommitted on whether the state will accept the resettlement of new refugees under a new Trump administration order that requires state consent, a spokeswoman says. Alabama is one of a handful of states that has not announced a decision after President Donald Trump said agencies must get written permission from state and local officials in jurisdictions where they want to resettle refugees beyond June 2020. “At this point, our office is still working through the executive order and consulting with the State Department and other entities involved in order to reach a decision,” Ivey Press Secretary Gina Maiola wrote in an email. Alabama has historically taken in few refugees. The state took in 46 refugees in fiscal year 2017, according to a report from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Negotiations between the Anchorage School District and the federal government over earthquake damage relief could result in the district turning down tens of millions in funds, an official says. The negotiations over money to repair damage caused by the state’s November 2018 earthquake could take months or years, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The Federal Emergency Management Agency would require the district to carry earthquake insurance if it accepts federal reimbursement for specific repairs, District Chief Operating Officer Tom Roth says. Categories of disaster reimbursement have different sets of federal requirements, Roth says. Federal money is available for repairs and damage and debris cleanup in the immediate aftermath. For long-term repair work, FEMA requires the insurance coverage.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Teaching vacancies throughout the state have increased by more than 150 positions compared to last year, a report says. The Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association released the report last week saying a quarter of teaching positions in the state are vacant, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The report identified 1,846 vacancies out of the 209 school districts and charter schools that participated in the statewide survey. The survey found about 1,000 teachers statewide either abandoned or resigned from their teaching positions during the first half of the school year. The report found Pima County’s nine largest school districts, including Tucson Unified School District, began the school year with 19% fewer vacancies than last year, which district officials say is better but still not good. The report also found about half the teaching positions are filled by teachers who do not meet state certification requirements.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An attorney is suing local officials for denying him access to a courthouse while carrying a handgun, testing a state law meant to allow lawyers to possess firearms on court premises, according to the law’s authors. Chris Corbitt, a patent attorney from Conway, filed the complaint last Thursday against Pulaski County officials after a security guard refused to let him enter the county’s district courthouse Jan. 3 while he carried his concealed gun. Corbitt, a concealed-carry licensee with an enhanced permit, said he usually leaves his weapon in his car, but he forgot to do so before he walked into the courthouse this month. State law bans firearms from courthouses, except for bailiffs and other “officers of the court.” Corbitt argues that definition includes attorneys.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Four homeless women who were ordered by a judge last week to leave a vacant house were evicted before dawn Tuesday by a group of heavily armed sheriff’s deputies in a case that highlighted the state’s severe housing shortage and growing numbers of homeless people. Alameda County Sheriff’s deputies escorted the women out of the home and bound their hands with plastic ties as dozens of community activists on the sidewalk chanted, “Let the moms go! Let the moms go!” and recorded the chaotic scene with their cellphones. “They came in like an Army for mothers and babies,” Dominique Walker, one of the mothers, told reporters. “We have the right to housing. This is just the beginning.” The women and their children moved into the three-bedroom house in November, partly to protest the methods of speculators who they say snap up distressed homes and leave them empty despite the housing crisis.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A park across from the Capitol where homeless people have been camping was being shut down Wednesday because officials say it has become infested with rats. More than 30 tents lined the edge of the park in the morning. Footage from KDVR-TV showed police officers going from tent to tent to let people know they need to leave and campers talking to other city officials looking to find out if they want to take advantage of social services. Hundreds of rats are currently living in Liberty Park and could spread diseases through their feces and human contact, among other ways, Tammy Vigil, a spokeswoman for the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment, told The Denver Post. “The reason the rats are so big is because of all the food that’s left there – all the food waste that’s not thrown away,” Vigil said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Two University of Connecticut students arrested for shouting a racial slur outside a campus apartment complex sued the school Tuesday, citing free speech rights as they fight officials’ attempts to remove them from school housing. Jarred Karal, of Plainville, and Ryan Mucaj, of Granby, both 21, filed the lawsuit in federal court, seeing undisclosed damages and a halt to disciplinary proceedings against them. The two students say the school is violating their First Amendment rights by bringing disciplinary hearings that have included a recommendation to remove them from student housing for violating a “disruptive behavior” policy. Karal told police the group was playing a game in which they would yell an offensive word, according to an arrest warrant affidavit. The first person who refuses to say the word loses, he said. They decided to change the game to shouting the racial epithet, he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Hours before the General Assembly convened for its 2020 legislative session – and much to the surprise of lawmakers – State House staff announced plans to unionize. The organization, which calls itself the Delaware General Assembly Union, announced its intent to unionize in a tweet Tuesday morning, saying it “will be the first partisan-inclusive state legislative union in the country.” There are about 170 part-time and full-time staffers at Legislative Hall. According to the progressive nonprofit publication Prospect.org, which published an article on the news that was shared by the union’s Twitter account, the union group would include 44 of those staffers. A press release announcing the union called the effort a “historic step forward for public service workers across the country.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A photo of multiple D.C. Fire and EMS recruits apparently holding “white power” symbols is circulating across social media platforms, WUSA-TV reports. The gesture is similar to the “OK” hand sign but typically inverted. The three fingers extended are meant to represent a “W,” and the circle coming off the arm is a “P” – “WP” for “white power.” The photograph surfaced on Facebook and includes Recruit Class 387 and their instructors, D.C. Fire and EMS said. The agency said officials were made away of the picture Wednesday. The department said it believes the picture was taken in March 2019, and the recruit class graduated in April 2019. The department is now investigating the picture and is considering interviewing everyone pictured.\n\nFlorida\n\nPanama City Beach: Officials in this Panhandle beach town are hoping tourists want to do more than frolic in the surf and lay in the sun. They’re hoping tourists will help rebuild a neighboring beach town devastated by Hurricane Michael in 2018. Officials in Panama City Beach on Tuesday introduced a program that allows tourists during their visit to help build homes and plant sea oats in the sand dunes of neighboring Mexico Beach, which was demolished by the category 5 storm. The tourism promotion agency is offering a “Stay it Forward” package for tourists interested in helping out. Dan Rowe, CEO of Visit Panama City Beach, said tourists have been asking during their visits how they can help area residents. Compared to surrounding areas, Panama City Beach was comparatively unscathed by Hurricane Michael. “Mexico Beach has come a long way, but there is still work to do,” Rowe said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Two state lawmakers say they won’t support a bill this year that would create a new coastal city. State Sen. Ben Watson and state Rep. Jesse Petrea, both Savannah Republicans, made the announcement Tuesday regarding the proposed city of Chatham Islands. Residents of Wilmington, Whitmarsh, Talahi and Oatland islands have expressed opposition to incorporation, the lawmakers said. The movement to form what would be Chatham County’s second-largest city, with an estimated population of 26,000, began after another lawmaker sought to consolidate the Savannah city and Chatham County governments. That move sparked opposition among residents of the islands. However, city-county consolidation has stalled because of a lack of local support. A study by the University of Georgia found the islands could finance their own city government if a local option sales tax were imposed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State House and Senate leaders, with the support of Gov. David Ige, on Tuesday unveiled a long list of measures to boost housing, early childhood education and incomes, with a particular focus on alleviating the struggles of Hawaii’s working families and poor. It’s the first joint bill package from the two legislative chambers since 2004. “The House and Senate members have been working really hard over the interim to address an issue that is important to all of us – that is the cost of living in Hawaii,” House Speaker Scott Saiki said at a news conference. The proposals still need to be drafted into bills, pass committees and the full House and Senate, and then earn the governor’s signature before they can become law. The new legislative session began Wednesday. The measures include increasing the hourly minimum wage from the current $10.10 to $13 by 2024.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: New legislation introduced Tuesday would require voters who want to participate in a closed presidential primary to affiliate with that party 90 days before the primary. The House State Affairs Committee voted Tuesday to hold a hearing on the legislation. Republicans close their primaries in Idaho, while Democrats do not. Republicans are concerned some voters might affiliate with their party to throw a primary vote to a less popular candidate more likely to lose in the general election. Non-presidential, closed primaries in Idaho already have a 60-day party affiliation deadline. The deadlines are based on the last day candidates can file to run for political office. Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said the attorney general’s office in a Dec. 5 letter said it had determined closed presidential primaries in Idaho have no such deadline.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: State regulators say they are investigating apparent violations of a rule intended to prevent marijuana shops from stockpiling weed from a single cultivator while also reminding retailers that they are required by law to keep enough product on hand for medical patients. Just over a week after the state’s recreational pot sales kicked off Jan. 1, the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation sent a letter to dispensaries Friday saying they were aware of violations and probing whether stores were illegally sourcing more than 40% of their product from one grower. The law is aimed at preventing pot growers from entering into exclusive agreements with specific shops and making sure all stores have a diversity of products from various sources.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A 102-year-old man who is Indiana’s oldest state employee is retiring after nearly six decades on the job, saying that “your body tells you when it’s time to go.” Bob Vollmer plans to report to work for the last time Feb. 6 as a surveyor for the Department of Natural Resources. The southern Indiana man, whose mother lived to be 108, joined the state agency in 1962. The World War II veteran still travels Indiana collecting technical field data and confirming boundary lines for DNR-managed properties, but he said his body finally is telling him it’s time to retire. Vollmer said he plans to spend his retirement devoting himself to reading and farming. He also plans to take trips to some of the South Pacific islands he was on during his wartime service with the U.S. Navy.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A man sentenced last month to 16 years in prison after he burned a gay pride banner argued before his trial that the lawyer appointed to represent him had a conflict of interest because she is a lesbian, newly released court records show. Adolfo Martinez was arrested in June after he stole a pride banner hanging at Ames United Church of Christ and burned it outside a nearby club. Martinez admitted his actions were driven by his dislike of gay people. He unsuccessfully argued for dismissal of a charge against him of third-degree arson in violation of individual rights – hate crime, contending that his prosecution would violate his First Amendment right to free speech. In addition to the arson hate crime, he was found guilty in November of harassment and reckless use of fire or explosives.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state began issuing new personalized license plates Wednesday that emphasize the state’s growing use of renewable energy. The “Powering the Future” plates feature wind turbines profiled against a sunrise. Wind-generated power in Kansas grew sixfold from 2009 to 2018, and a report last year said the state was the nation’s top producer of wind energy, with more than 36% of total electricity coming from wind power. “I am pleased that this license plate design comes on the heels of Kansas being ranked first in the nation for percentage of electricity produced by wind,” Gov. Laura Kelly said. “At the same time, it is a display of an expanding industry that contributes so much to the economic fabric of our state.” Residents can order the plates through their county treasurer’s office for $45.50, plus normal registration fees and taxes.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave: Mammoth Cave National Park is offering free tours Monday in honor of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The park can accommodate 70 people on each Mammoth Passage tour. The free tours Jan. 20 will depart from the visitor center at 9:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. CST. The 3/ 4 -mile, 1 1/ 4 -hour tour requires a walk down and up a steep path to the Historic Entrance and includes 160 steps. The tour explores a canyon passageway and discusses a 19th-century saltpeter mining operation and the cave’s geologic origins. Tour participants must pick up their free tickets in the visitor center before the tour.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing fees for using eight national wildlife refuges in southeast Louisiana and is also considering lottery alligator hunts on six of its refuges. The two together could raise about $120,000 for the Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges Complex, about two-thirds of the money from user permits, project leader Neil Lalonde said Monday. The user fees would be $20 for an annual permit or $5 for a one-day permit, a news release said. People age 60 and over could get a $5 annual pass, and those under age 18 would not need a permit. Two permits would be needed to get into all eight refuges administered by Southeast Louisiana National Wildlife Refuges Complex staff.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Proposed changes to a decades-old settlement between the state and American Indian tribal groups could give the tribes more authority in long-debated subjects such as gambling and fishing rights. A task force handed its recommendations to the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, which began considering them Tuesday. The recommendations include a call to affirm the tribes’ rights to regulate hunting, fishing and land use, the Portland Press Herald reports. Another recommendation is to enable tribes to operate casinos under a compact negotiated among tribal leaders, the federal government and the state. The task force spent more than six months putting together the recommendations, which would affect four federally recognized tribes in Maine. Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis said the changes have “potential for tremendous impacts on some highly disadvantaged people and some very proud governments.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan has announced the awarding of nearly $9 million in tax credits for state residents with student loan debt. The administration says 9,600 applicants were eligible for the Student Loan Debt Relief Tax Credit. That includes 6,331 who attended in-state institutions who will each get $1,000 in tax credits. There were 3,269 eligible applicants who attended out-of-state institutions who will receive $813 each in tax credits. “It is critical that we look for ways to help those in our state crippled by student loan debt,” Hogan said in a statement announcing the tax credits. “This program helps Maryland taxpayers pay off student debt, while remaining in the workforce and having a positive impact on the state economy.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A police officer was so infuriated after a confrontation with another driver on an area highway that he sent the man a fake $790 citation and a curt note that read, “Try fighting this… I dare you!” prosecutors say. Officer Christopher Curtis was released on personal recognizance after pleading not guilty Tuesday to forgery, witness intimidation and misleading an investigation. Neither he nor his attorney commented outside court. Curtis is on unpaid administrative leave, a Boston Police Department spokesman said. The other driver told investigators he was driving south on Interstate 93 north of the city March 1 when he saw a white pickup truck coming close to the back of his car. The driver, who was not identified in court records, said the pickup driver honked at him, sped toward his car, merged into the lane on his right and then veered back into the left lane, nearly forcing him into the median barrier, according to court records.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Six weeks into the recreational marijuana business in the state, sales have exceeded $10million. The high-water mark of $10,090,446 in sales also means that $1,675,014 in revenues from a 10% excise tax and 6% sales tax flowed into state coffers. Michigan marijuana enthusiasts were able to start buying legal weed Dec. 1, roughly 13 months after voters approved a ballot proposal that legalized marijuana use and possession for anyone who is at least 21. The proposal, which passed 56-44%, also allows for people to grow up to 12 plants in their home for personal use. Right now, the sales are happening at 16 marijuana retail shops that have gotten state licenses and have been able to open. There are 35 shops that have been licensed by the state, but many are waiting to open until they have enough marijuana products to meet the demand.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: Union snowplow drivers went on strike in northeastern Minnesota, where a winter weather advisory was posted as snow moved into the region. Teamsters Local 320 official Brian Aldes said the strike in St. Louis County began Wednesday. Union members voted overwhelmingly Saturday to reject the county’s final contract offer, citing issues related to health care and accrued sick leave. “These hardworking employees make a daily commitment to drive into blizzard conditions when most folks avoid inclement weather,” Erik Skoog, the union’s chief negotiator, said in a Facebook post. “These employees spend nights, holidays, and weekends clearing roads in dangerous conditions and will not continue to be second class employees.” County officials have a contingency plan to keep roads plowed. Public works supervisors and staff in other departments are qualified and licensed to operate the snowplows, county spokeswoman Dana Kazel says.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A rain-swollen lake in rural north Mississippi rose at least a foot overnight amid forecasts of additional downpours, keeping heavy pressure on a dam Wednesday that officials said was in danger of failing. An inspection of the earthen dam at Oktibbeha County on Tuesday led to warnings that it was in danger of failing and recommendations that area residents evacuate. With as much as 5 inches of rain forecast by the weekend, workers were monitoring a soggy landslide that stoked the fears. Oktibbeha County’s emergency director, Kristen Campanella, said the lake level’s rise endangered about 130 properties and nine highways downstream. Mississippi has one of the highest numbers of dams that pose dangers and are in poor or unsatisfactory condition, according to a two-year investigation by the Associated Press.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has filed what she calls an unprecedented federal civil rights lawsuit, accusing the city, the local police union and others of a coordinated and racist conspiracy aimed at forcing her out of office. Gardner, the city’s elected prosecutor, also accused “entrenched interests” of intentionally impeding her efforts to reform racist practices that have led to a loss of trust in the criminal justice system. The lawsuit alleges civil rights violations as well as violations of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. Gardner is black. The named defendants are white. The lawsuit names the city of St. Louis;the St. Louis Police Officers Association; its business manager, Jeff Roorda; and Gerard Carmody, a special prosecutor who indicted an investigator hired by Gardner. It also names Carmody’s son and daughter, who helped in his investigation, and a former police officer who sued over Gardner’s use of private attorneys related to Carmody’s investigation.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State lawmakers and members of the public weighed in Tuesday on whether the Legislature should switch to annual 45-day sessions rather than meeting every other year for 90 days, as they do now. The 2019 Legislature passed a bill to study the idea of holding one session to address policy and another to set a two-year budget. Montana is one of four states without an annual legislative session. Some lawmakers suggested shorter sessions might allow young people to serve in the Legislature, saying that leaving a job for 45 days every year might be easier than missing 90 days of work every other year. State Sen. John Esp, R-Big Timber, said meeting more often might help build working relationships among the lawmakers, allowing them to better serve the people of Montana. Sen. Dee Brown, R-Hungry Horse, said she supports annual sessions but suggested limiting the number of bills that could be introduced each session.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state suffered more than $3.4 billion in losses from disastrous weather last year, according to a federal report. The bomb cyclone in March caused most of the damage, said the National Centers for Environmental Information, a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The rain and snowmelt runoff led to record flooding in eastern Nebraska and in Iowa, and the storm system included a blizzard that struck most of western Nebraska. The bomb cyclone “was an unprecedented event, in scope and size and impact on the state of Nebraska,” Bryan Tuma, assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, told the Omaha World-Herald. “I don’t think we’ve ever quite experienced anything like this before.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: MGM Resorts International is selling the real estate assets of the MGM Grand on the Las Vegas Strip to a joint venture for about $2.5 billion. The joint venture includes private-equity and real estate company Blackstone Group and MGM Growth Properties LLC. MGM Resorts anticipates cash proceeds of approximately $2.4 billion. The joint venture will be owned 50.1% by MGM Growth Properties and 49.9% by Blackstone. It will also acquire the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay from MGM Growth Properties and lease both properties to MGM Resorts for an initial rent of $292 million. The total value of the two transactions is $4.6 billion. The Mandalay Bay was the site of a 2017 shooting that left 58 people dead. It is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: An organization that welcomes troops passing through Portsmouth International Airport has announced plans to change its operations because of elevated threats at airports. The president of the Pease Greeters, Frank Lasorsa, wrote to members that because of “elevated threat levels,” greeters’ activities will change to address potential threats. Greeters will still greet troops but will no longer provide food, beverages and giveaways, and the only flight information made available to greeters will be through public websites. “Once a Greeter determines there is troop flight scheduled for arrival, Greeters may still arrive at the airport to support our brave men and women,” Lasorsa wrote. “Sharing any determined flight information on social media is strongly discouraged.” The Pease Greeters Care Package program will go on, but greeters will no longer bring any items to provide to individual service members.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: Three police officers who have been credited with preventing further bloodshed during last month’s fatal attack on a kosher market are being promoted. Mayor Steven Fulop appointed officers Kendric Jackson, Mariela Fernandez and Raymond Sanchez to the rank of detective at a ceremony at City Hall on Wednesday. Sanchez and Fernandez were among the first to respond after David Anderson and Francine Graham stormed the market and killed three people in an anti-Semitic attack. Both officers suffered injuries and were treated and released from a hospital after the attacks. Anderson and Graham died after a lengthy shootout with police. Before attacking the market, they shot and killed Jersey City Police Detective Joseph Seals in what authorities have said was a chance encounter in a cemetery about a mile from the store.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest water utility has started operating its first aquifer storage well, and officials say more direct injection wells are planned within the utility’s service area through Albuquerque and Bernalillo County. Testing of the new system began this week. The well will allow excess surface water to be stored underground for later use, keeping it safe from any losses due to evaporation. Officials say the $1 million well is part of a larger water management strategy that also includes conservation and reuse. The well injects water more than 1,200 feet below the surface at a rate of 1,750 gallons per minute. The amount of water injected yearly will depend on the amount of excess surface water available from the San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The comptroller says the state once again is paying much more in federal taxes than it receives in federal spending. A report released Tuesday says New York paid $26.6 billion more in federal taxes in the fiscal year ending in 2018 than in got back in federal funds. New York has seen a gap dating back to 2013, when it totaled $19.9 billion. Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli says the balance jumped in 2018, when New Yorkers paid $4 billion more in taxes as federal spending increased by $1.5 billion. DiNapoli says the ongoing trend makes it critical that the upcoming 2020 census is accurate and maximizes the state’s population count. The comptroller’s report says New York is one of just seven states that sends more to the federal government than it receives.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A local advocacy group has started a petition to try to get Amazon to stop selling an animal trap that can injure bears. The group Help Asheville Bears is appealing directly to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and has gathered 32,000 signatures. The petition asks the company to stop selling steel-jaw, leg-hold traps. Certain foothold traps are legal in North Carolina. But they’re illegal to use on black bears. The traps are legal for animals such as foxes and coyotes. The group says the devices also catch small bears. Jody Williams, a spokesman for Help Asheville Bears, says Amazon has replied to the group about the petition. She says the company said it would forward the information to the appropriate people.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Bismarck Public Schools is believed to be the first district in the state to own an airplane. The school board has given administrators the go-ahead to buy a Cessna 150, single-engine plane for the student aviation program at the district’s Career Academy. District business manager Darin Scherr says the plane will cost between $15,000 and $30,000 depending on its condition, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Owning a plane rather than renting one will save money for the district, as well as for the families of students in the program. Using a rental plane costs families $10,850 a year and the district $6,650. Ownership will drop that by nearly half, to $5,350 a year for families and $2,963 for the district, according to Scherr. That includes yearly costs, such as insurance and hangar rental, as well as costs for engine and propeller overhauls, which occur every four years.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A union representing the white Cleveland police officer who shot and killed Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black child playing with a pellet gun outside a recreation center, will ask an appeals court to overturn the officer’s firing. A Cuyahoga County judge last month upheld an arbitrator’s decision that Timothy Loehmann should be fired for failing to disclose on his Cleveland job application that he had been previously dismissed from a suburban police department. Loehmann and his training officer were cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the death of Tamir in November 2014. The child was shot by Loehmann within seconds of a cruiser driven by Patrolman Frank Garmback skidding to a stop near him. “We think our appeal has merit and look forward to having a review by the Court of Appeals,” union attorney Henry Hilow told cleveland.com.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The governor wants the state’s school superintendent to be appointed rather than elected, which would give the governor more power over public education. Gov. Kevin Stitt did not specify if he wanted to appoint the position or wanted the state Board of Education to make the decision. Stitt already appoints six of the seven board members. Stitt said he’s frustrated by his limited ability to affect education policy. “When the governor’s elected by all 4 million Oklahomans, the people think that he or she’s supposed to be able to go in and make some different moves on education to get outcomes,” Stitt said. “That’s just common sense. That’s what I thought when I was sitting in Tulsa in the business world. That’s what people in Oklahoma think.” Of nearly 4 million Oklahomans, 644,579 voted for Stitt to become governor.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Widespread snowstorms have boosted the Pacific Northwest’s previously anemic snowpack to almost normal levels statewide in just two weeks. The biggest improvements in what is called “snow-water equivalent” – the amount of water contained in the snowpack – are in the Hood, Sandy and Lower Deschutes basins. Those areas were at 26% of normal Dec. 30 and are now at 90% of normal, the Capital Press reports. Last year saw something similar unfold in Oregon, when a series of storms hit in February that boosted what had been a lagging level of snow-water equivalent. This year statewide, the snow-water equivalent increased from 45% of normal to 79% of normal between Dec. 30 and Jan. 14, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service, which tracks the measurements. Snowpack is a crucial source of water for farms, especially in Eastern Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state House voted Tuesday to force public agencies to post agendas on their websites at least a day before the meetings at which related votes are held. State representatives unanimously approved the proposed amendments to the state Sunshine Act. The prime sponsor, Rep. Aaron Bernstine, R-Lawrence, said the bill will help ensure governments do not operate in the shadows. “When our citizens know what will be discussed at a meeting ahead of time, they can better participate in a government in a meaningful way,” Bernstine said. Officials would not be allowed to vote on anything that was not on the posted agenda, except when an emergency has arisen that threatens life or property or when the issue at hand is considered extremely minor and does not involve spending money. Items could also be added to agendas during meetings by a majority vote.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor has set an aggressive timeline to power the electric grid completely by renewable energy, but it’s an attainable goal, the state’s acting energy commissioner said Wednesday. Acting Commissioner Nicholas Ucci said his office will spend the rest of this year developing strategies and policies to meet the goal by 2030 and analyzing the economic, environmental and energy system impacts. In her State of the State address to lawmakers Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo announced she will sign an executive order that aims to make the state the first in the nation to be powered completely by renewable energy by the end of the decade. The remark drew a standing ovation. The state is already positioned to meet more than a third of its electricity demand with renewable energy sources by 2024, Ucci said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of a bill that would ban almost all abortions want some leaders in the state Senate to know they won’t let the proposal quietly die. Hundreds of them packed a Statehouse lobby Wednesday to call for a vote on the bill whose only likely obstacle to becoming law is passing a two-thirds procedural vote in the Senate. There are enough Democrats and Republicans from less conservative districts to keep blocking the bill. Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey has said several times before the 2020 legislative session started this week that Republicans don’t have the votes and that he sees no need to halt debate on other issues like tax reform, education or selling state-owned utility Santee Cooper for several days for a filibuster that according to his vote-counting math can’t be beat. That’s what happened in 2018 to a similar abortion ban bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council has passed an ordinance denouncing acts of hate and racism after equal rights organizations and others called on the city to do more to respond to racist incidents. Mayor Paul TenHaken brought what he called an “anti-hate” resolution to the council in order to send a message that Sioux Falls is a welcoming place for all religions, races and sexual orientations. Councilors took their turns Tuesday night voicing support. Councilor Janet Brekke said the resolution is a positive step toward driving hate out of the community but noted that it is just a starting point. In September, South Dakota Voices for Peace organized a march in the city after a black teen was subjected to racial slurs in downtown Sioux Falls. Video of what happened was posted on social media and viewed widely.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Amtrak is in discussions to bring passenger rail service back to the capital and expand routes in Memphis. Company representatives traveled to Nashville to discuss their ideas with state legislators Tuesday afternoon. Two of the proposed lines would connect Memphis to Chicago and Nashville to Atlanta with stops in Murfreesboro, Tullahoma and Chattanooga. The only Amtrak stops in Tennessee are in Memphis and Newbern-Dyersburg. Nashville service halted in 1979 when the Floridian line from Chicago to Florida was shut down to save money. But Music City’s fast-growing population has caught Amtrak’s eye again.\n\nTexas\n\nBellaire: A minor has been charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 16-year-old high school student, prosecutors said. The minor and another person were arrested about 31/ 2 hours after the Tuesday afternoon shooting at a high school in Bellaire, a suburb southwest of Houston. A spokesman for the Harris County District Attorney’s Office said Wednesday that the minor could not be identified because of privacy laws and did not immediately answer other questions. Authorities also haven’t released basic non-identifying information about the alleged shooter, including the person’s age or sex. Police said they received a call about the shooting about 4 p.m., and the victim died later at a hospital. There have been conflicting media reports about whether the shooting happened inside or outside the school.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Personalized license plates that spark multiple complaints will get extra scrutiny amid questions about how a plate emblazoned with the phrase “DEPORTM” could be on the road despite strict state rules and previous objections. If more than one person reports a particular plate, it will now be flagged for extra attention and reviewed by the attorney general’s office, said Scott Smith, who oversees the motor-vehicles division as executive director of the Utah Tax Commission. “The safety net here is the general public,” Smith told lawmakers at a hearing Wednesday that came after a photo of the “deport” plate gained widespread attention online. Among other rules, Utah prohibits vanity plates that express contempt for any race, religion or political opinion. License plates don’t carry unlimited freedom of speech rights, he said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Advocates held a homelessness awareness day and memorial vigil Wednesday. Concerned citizens and homeless service providers planned to gather at the Statehouse to talk with lawmakers and “renew their commitment to end homelessness” in Vermont. According to a one-day count, 1,089 Vermonters were found to be homeless on a single night in January 2019, event organizers said. That was a 15% drop from a one-day count in 2018, but “homelessness is still a major challenge for Vermonters, especially because 23% of those counted were children,” organizers of the event said. A vigil was planned at noon on the Statehouse steps, where legislative leaders and Lt. Gov, David Zuckerman, who just announced that he’s running for governor, were expected to speak. Wednesday’s activities were sponsored by the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness, Chittenden County Homeless Alliance and Vermont Affordable Housing Coalition.\n\nVirginia\n\nRocky Mount: A county school board has decided not to update its dress code to ban displays of the Confederate flag. The Roanoke Times reports the decision followed months of debate in Franklin County, which is outside Roanoke in western Virginia. Many school board members said such a ban could violate students’ rights to free speech and spur legal challenges. An amendment adding the ban to the dress code failed 4-4, and the vote on passing the dress code without it was 7 to 1. Penny Blue, the board’s only black member, was the sole “no” vote. She had proposed the measure last fall when the board was considering changes to its dress code. She argued the flag was a symbol of white supremacy. Other members said they personally detested the flag but raised concerns about free speech. School officials cited a 2000 court case in Kentucky that could have legal precedent in Virginia. The Kentucky school’s attempt to ban the flag failed.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: One year after Microsoft announced it was committing $500 million toward affordable housing in the area, it’s upping that by half. The additional $250 million will provide a line of credit to help the Washington State Finance Commission finance about 3,000 additional units of affordable housing, Jane Broom, the company’s senior director of philanthropies, said in a blog post Wednesday. Microsoft’s own success has helped the region boom economically, with Amazon and other tech companies expanding. But as it has, the cost of housing has skyrocketed. Homelessness is a severe concern, and even people with good middle-income jobs, such as teachers and nurses, have been priced out of the cities where they work.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The House of Delegates on Wednesday approved a bill that would penalize physicians who don’t provide medical care to a baby born after an abortion attempt. Lawmakers passed the bill 93-5 despite questions about what use it would serve, since existing laws protect newborns, and the state bans abortions after 20 weeks. “This bill does absolutely nothing,” said Del. John Doyle, a Democrat from Jefferson County. “It proposes to make something illegal that is already illegal.” Some Republicans in the GOP-controlled chamber conceded that the bill, which would subject medical professionals to discipline from their licensing board, is more about sending a political message than solving an ongoing problem.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWausau: City officials voted Tuesday night to change the language of the now-famed “snowball ordinance,” making it legal to throw snowballs on city property once again. It will likely take effect by the week’s end, City Council President Lisa Rasmussen said. A city ordinance that technically banned snowball fights was a small part of a larger ordinance banning people from throwing objects such as stones and arrows on city-owned property. It was originally believed to have been adopted in 1962. However, City Attorney Anne Jacobson did some more digging and said it’s been on the books since at least 1884 that you can’t throw snowballs on public property, even with slightly different language. The City Council decided to reconsider the law after some negative national headlines this past holiday season. Barstool Sports called Wausau “the worst town in America” for outlawing snowball fights.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has requested $12 million from the state to fund more than half of a renovation and expansion project for its College of Law. The law school project did not make it into the university’s formal request vetted by the State Construction Department and Republican Gov. Mark Gordon’s office last year before going to the Legislature in December, Laramie Boomerang reports. “We were designing the facility and didn’t know the cost of the facility over the summer,” Dean Klint Alexander told the Joint Appropriations Committee on Friday. The project is designed to add about 19,000 square feet and upgrade about 23,000 square feet of existing space in order to fit multiple clinics into the building, officials said. The school’s current clinics provide $3.5 million of free legal services each year, and that could increase with better facilities, Alexander said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/25/underground-proms-popcorn-problems-lobster-relief-news-around-states/115638782/", "title": "Underground proms, popcorn problems: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey this week urged people to wear masks in public after a statewide mandate expires next month. Ivey has been adamant that she will not extend the mask mandate past April 9. On Monday, her office released designs for signs for businesses to use to request patrons to wear masks. The designs range from “Mask Preferred” to “Mask Required For Service.” Face coverings “remain one of the most successful tools we have to keep folks safe from COVID-19,” Ivey said in a statement. “Masks are soon to be a memory but until then, lets wear them out.” Alabama expanded eligibility Monday for COVID-19 vaccinations, adding more than 2 million people to the groups who can get a COVID-19 shot in Alabama and roughly doubling the number of residents now eligible. The additions include more front-line workers; people 55 and older; those with intellectual and developmental disabilities; and residents ages 16 to 64 with certain high-risk medical conditions. The qualifying medical conditions include cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, smoking, obesity, sickle cell disease and heart conditions. State Health Officer Dr. Scott Harris on Friday said most adults will now be eligible for shots and urged people to be patient as they seek vaccination appointments.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: People who are fully vaccinated do not need to wear masks at work in the city when they are in their own workspace away from the public and unvaccinated colleagues, under an updated emergency order that took effect Tuesday. Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson’s office, in a release, called the update an easing of an existing mask mandate “that balances vaccination progress in Anchorage with the importance of masks in reducing transmission of COVID-19.” Under the order, employers would have to verify an employee’s vaccination status, “in a manner consistent with workplace anti-discrimination laws.” Masks still are required in Anchorage in indoor public settings and communal spaces outside the home and at outdoor public gatherings. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a person fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose of a two-dose vaccine or two weeks after receiving a one-dose vaccine. In the Anchorage area, 27% of those 16 and older are considered fully vaccinated, information provided by the state health department shows.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: COVID-19 vaccine appointments opened Wednesday morning to all Arizonans 16 and older, and the rush to get them was huge. All available slots for state-operated COVID-19 vaccine sites were taken within 20 minutes, health officials said in a tweet, but more will be available at 11 a.m. Friday, when the state will release tens of thousands of new appointments for the following week. The five vaccine sites operated by the state are State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona State University’s Phoenix Municipal Stadium in Tempe, Chandler-Gilbert Community College, the University of Arizona in central Tucson and, as of this Friday, Yuma Civic Center in Yuma County. Vaccine appointments are also available at individual pharmacies, through their websites, and through some individual counties. To book and schedule vaccines, go to podvaccine.azdhs.gov. Those without computer access or needing extra help registering can call 844-542-8201 to be connected with someone who can assist in scheduling. People can contact the call center when it opens at 8 a.m., as it gets canceled appointments released to it daily.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Cities won’t be able to enforce their own mask mandates to curb the coronavirus when the state ends its requirement as soon as next week, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday. The Republican governor told reporters he expected Arkansas’ requirement to end March 31, saying the state has so far met the criteria for positive coronavirus tests and hospitalizations that he set for the mandate’s end when he lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions last month. Hutchinson said officials are still working on guidance for cities, employers and schools systems. He said school districts will likely have a local option, and businesses can have their own requirements, but cities couldn’t have that option. “We’re going to go on this together,” Hutchinson said at his weekly virus briefing. “One statewide standard is what I expect to announce next week.” Before Hutchinson signed the state’s mask mandate last year, he had allowed cities to enforce mask ordinances that did not include penalties for not complying.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: With improving coronavirus numbers continuing to fall, much of the San Francisco Bay Area can reopen to a greater degree, and 94% of California’s population is out from under the most severe restrictions, officials said Tuesday. San Francisco, Marin and Santa Clara counties were among those moving to less restrictive tiers in the state’s four-level system. The three joined neighboring Santa Mateo County as the latest Bay Area counties to move into California’s “moderate” tier for coronavirus restrictions, meaning restaurants and other businesses can serve more customers. Higher-risk businesses including bowling alleys and outdoor bars that don’t serve food can reopen. San Francisco Mayor London Breed and Director of Health Dr. Grant Colfax said the expanded activities could begin Wednesday. Breed credited swift vaccinations and ongoing safety precautions for the shift. “This year has been so tough on so many – from our kids and families, to our small businesses and their employees – and this move to the orange tier and reopening more activities and businesses than we have since last March gives us all more hope for the future,” Breed said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: About 1,000 front-line essential restaurant and food service workers received COVID-19 shots during a mass vaccination clinic Tuesday at The Ranch events complex. The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment received additional vaccines from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to administer to the workers who recently became eligible under the state’s Phase 1B.4 vaccine distribution plan. The industry has been hit hard by the pandemic, with the county reporting that restaurant workers have experienced the highest occupational unemployment rate at nearly 28%, and 30% of the county’s restaurant workers are people of color whose communities have experienced higher-than-average COVID-19 case rates. County restaurants have seen as much as a 50% decrease in revenue since March 2020. Carol and Tim Cochran, owners of the Horse & Dragon Brewing Company in Fort Collins, were among those vaccinated Tuesday, along with employees. “This is a start in the right direction,” Carol said as the couple waited in the observation line after receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson shot. “Once we can get almost everyone vaccinated, we will be able to open with abandon and not be worried about being a vector for the disease.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The Senior Resources Agency on Aging’s Senior Nutrition Program has worked to meet increased need during the COVID-19 pandemic through revision of the Congregate Meals Program and expansion of the Home Delivered Meals Program. According to Kathy Chase, director of contracts at Senior Resources, more than 400,000 meals were provided to about 3,500 older adult residents of Eastern Connecticut in the past year. The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program began in 1972 to reduce hunger and food insecurity, promote socialization, encourage health and well-being, and delay adverse health conditions. Meals are prepared to meet the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, so they are appropriate for everyone including those with diabetes or other chronic health conditions. Older Americans Act programs including the Senior Nutrition Program are managed through Area Agencies on Aging. When possible, the Congregate Meals Program offers meals in a group setting such as a senior center so that participants can socialize and engage in additional activities. There are no income guidelines for this program; donations are requested but not required. Priority may be given to persons of greatest need. To apply, visit seniorresourcesec.org.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A pilot of a walk-up COVID-19 vaccination clinic Wednesday was testing a process that could help inoculate people who’ve had difficulty registering for a shot. The event was limited to those who received a voucher from community groups in recent days. Being able to serve walk-ups without appointments at future vaccination events could help Delaware reach underserved communities and satisfy the state’s equity goal, state officials said. More than three months into the vaccine rollout, state data shows people in minority groups have received fewer vaccinations compared with white residents. Throughout the rollout, the state has asked those eligible for the vaccine – mostly older adults – to register online for an appointment waiting list and to monitor availability at pharmacies and other providers in the meantime. The system has led to frustration and confusion as demand continues to outpace supply. “We know that there is a disconnect at times with technology,” said AJ Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. State officials said walk-up events could be a solution for older residents who have had difficulty navigating the online system and could target areas where vaccination rates are low, though they are less efficient than large drive-thru events that require preregistration.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Because of the pandemic, the National Park Service will limit access to the Tidal Basin during this year’s peak bloom of D.C.’s cherry blossoms, WUSA-TV reports. NPS spokesperson Mike Litterst said in a release Tuesday that the restrictions were in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and DC Health and were made in consultation with the National Park Service Office of Public Health. “The National Park Service will limit all vehicular and pedestrian access to the Tidal Basin, East Potomac Park and West Potomac Park during the peak bloom period of the cherry blossoms as a public health precaution to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Litterst said in the release. This year, peak bloom is expected April 2-5, but the park service said restrictions are tentatively in place from March 26 through April 12. Updates or changes to the restriction dates will be posted on NPS’ social media. The National Park Service encourages those who want to take in the splendor of the cherry blossoms at peak bloom to do so virtually via its website.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: A state House committee approved a bill Wednesday to better prepare for public health emergencies, ranging from ensuring the state is well-stocked with personal protective equipment to allowing the governor more flexibility in spending to deal with a crisis. The bill approved by the House Pandemics & Public Emergencies Committee on a 14-4 vote also addresses how deaths are reported, would allow the Legislature to override a governor’s executive orders, and seeks to better inform the public on state spending on its response and emergency orders. The bill would require the state public health officer to develop a plan for every foreseeable public health emergency and update it every five years. It also spells out that health emergencies could include the release of toxic chemicals and nuclear agents, as well as biological toxins. But the four Democrats who opposed the bill took issue with provisions that limit emergency orders issued by local governments. “We should not be severely restricting the emergency powers of local governments. I think that makes us less safe, and I think that mayors shouldn’t have to ask permission from Tallahassee in order to be the mayors they were elected to be,” said Democratic Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: All Georgians 16 and older will be eligible for COVID-19 shots beginning Thursday. Gov. Brian Kemp made the announcement Tuesday, saying supplies of the vaccines continue to rise, and he’s confident that enough older adults have been vaccinated to open up inoculation to the broadest possible population. Figures from the Georgia Department of Public Health show the state has administered 3.2 million doses overall, with nearly 2.1 million people getting at least one dose. The number of doses being administered has shown a clear upward trend in recent weeks, with a peak of more than 85,000 doses given March 15, the first day Kemp expanded eligibility to current levels. Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium will get a boost in capacity starting Thursday when the Federal Emergency Management Agency adds doses to a site that had been run by Fulton County. Measures still show demand outstripping supply in metro Atlanta, while appointments are abundant in other areas. Kemp said the state directed 70% of this week’s 450,000 doses to metro Atlanta and areas north of the city “to put more supply where the demand is highest.” Georgia continues to lag most other states in vaccination, ranking second worst behind Alabama in the number of doses administered per 100,000 people 18 and older.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: There was a drop in the number of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students who went to college last year after graduating from Hawaii’s public schools, which a group of educational leaders attributes to the pandemic. A report by the Hawaii P-20 Partnerships for Education shows 35% of Native Hawaiians in the class of 2020 enrolled in college upon graduation, a decline from 44% for the class of 2019, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Figures for Pacific Islander graduates fell to 29% from 35%. According to the report, Hawaii’s public high schools had a record graduation rate in 2020, but far fewer graduates enrolled in college: 50% of last year’s graduating class went straight to college, down from 55% the previous year. It was the steepest one-year dip ever recorded, the newspaper reports. “The negative effects of the pandemic on educational progress in general are not equal across socioeconomic and demographic groups,” said Stephen Schatz, executive director of Hawaii P-20 Partnerships for Education. “In particular, economically disadvantaged, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders saw some pretty precipitous declines.” Schatz said the education community needs to act on the premise that the pandemic had an effect on all students’ academic and mental health.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation extending the tax filing deadline from April 15 to May 17 will be among lawmakers’ top priorities when they return to work April 6, a high-ranking state senator said. Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder said this week that he expects the Senate and House to expedite legislation to delay Idaho’s tax deadline a month to match the federal tax deadline that has again been pushed back because of the pandemic. “I’m hopeful that we can get back and get it done as quickly as possible,” he said, adding that lawmakers have numerous tools such as suspending rules to speed bills through both the House and Senate. The Internal Revenue Service announced last week that it has delayed the traditional federal tax filing deadline until May 17, providing more breathing room for taxpayers and the IRS to cope with changes caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Legislation was introduced last week in the state House to make the change for Idaho taxpayers. But the Legislature shut down a day later, on Friday, after six of the 70 House members tested positive for the virus within a week. Shortly after the shutdown, the Idaho State Tax Commission issued a statement saying the state’s filing deadline is still April 15, and it will be up to the Legislature to change it when it reconvenes.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: About 1,000 inmates scheduled for release in the next nine months could soon be set free as part of a settlement of a federal lawsuit filed last spring amid a growing COVID-19 health crisis in state lockups, a lawyer involved in the case said Tuesday. The settlement calls for the release of low- to medium-risk inmates who are within nine months of their release date and eligible for certain good-time credits, according to a court document filed Tuesday. The Illinois Department of Corrections agreed to “use its best efforts” to process the awards within the next month, the document says. Attorney Sheila Bedi said the settlement applies to about 1,000 inmates, and she believes thousands more should be released. “It remains a public health crisis,” Bedi, a professor at Northwestern University, told the Chicago Tribune. “It is still very much a real issue.” In a statement, Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s press secretary, Jordan Abudayyeh, said the Department of Corrections has consistently reviewed prisoner records to find those eligible for 180 days or less of earned discretionary sentencing credit. A consortium of Chicago civil rights attorneys and community activists filed the lawsuit seeking the release of as many as 13,000 inmates, arguing that prisons “pose a particular risk of spreading the COVID-19.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor announced Tuesday that he will lift the statewide mask mandate and remaining COVID-19 business restrictions in two weeks. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a speech from his Statehouse office that Indiana’s steep declines in coronavirus hospitalization and death rates along with the growing number of people fully vaccinated justify the steps starting April 6. Holcomb said he hoped the state was seeing the “tail end of this pandemic” that has killed nearly 13,000 people in the state over the past year. The date for ending the mask mandate was picked to coincide with the ending of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament now being held in Indianapolis and to allow more time for people with at-risk health conditions to get vaccine shots, Holcomb said. Local officials would still have the authority to impose tougher restrictions in response to COVID-19 cases in their communities, and face masks would still be required in K-12 schools for rest of this school year, he said. But some health experts worry it is premature to lift the statewide restrictions, pointing to the steep increase in hospitalizations and deaths Indiana saw beginning in September after the governor lifted most business restrictions before reinstating crowd limits after winning reelection in November.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Department of Public Health has acknowledged it significantly overestimated how many of Iowa’s senior citizens have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The department said March 12 that 94.9% of Iowans 65 or older had received at least one dose of a vaccine. Gov. Kim Reynolds said at a news conference March 17 that 95.3% of Iowa seniors had received at least one dose, and she touted such statistics in explaining why the state could soon be able to offer vaccinations to all residents 16 or older. But the numbers didn’t square with much lower estimates reported by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Tuesday, health department spokesperson Sarah Ekstrand said in an email that the state estimates were wrong. She said agency staff mistakenly had counted some seniors twice because those people were included in listings of Iowans receiving an initial dose of the vaccine and in listings of those receiving a second dose. After realizing their mistake, staffers recalculated and determined that 421,553 of Iowa’s 513,872 senior citizens – or 82% – had received at least one dose of a vaccine by Tuesday, Ekstrand said. On Tuesday, the CDC was reporting just 76% of Iowa seniors had received at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The only Asian American lawmaker serving in the Legislature says he was physically threatened in a western Kansas bar by an out-of-state patron, who questioned if he had been carrying COVID-19. In social media comments posted Friday, state Rep. Rui Xu, D-Westwood, said the man confronted him and, using an expletive, asked why he was wearing a face mask and whether he was carrying the coronavirus. “That’s a pretty specific dog whistle at Asian Americans from the last year,” said Xu, who is Chinese American. “Most of the anti-Asian American rhetoric that has happened has had some form of that message.” Moments after the confrontation, Xu said he heard the patron searching for him in the bar, yelling that he was going to “kick his ass.” Xu said he visited the Russell sports bar after featuring as a guest on a PBS television show based in nearby Bunker Hill. Xu said he was in the bar with the show’s host, who is white and also wore a mask but wasn’t targeted. “Everybody at the bar who’s actually from Russell was amazing and kind and I had a good time,” Xu said, adding that he doesn’t think where the incident happened is important.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state’s COVID-19 vaccination program continues to ramp up, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. Some 198,447 Kentuckians received a dose last week, breaking a previous weekly record of about 165,000 in early March. The Democratic governor noted that while demand continues to be high, some vaccine sites in western and eastern Kentucky have open appointments. He urged residents in those regions to sign up if they are eligible. Beshear also announced the opening of a vaccination site at the Kentucky Dam Village Convention Center in Gilbertsville. “This is a new site we stood up in western Kentucky to ensure the area was getting significant amounts of vaccine,” Beshear said. “As of today, they have more than 2,000 available appointments in this coming week. That means any Kentuckian, age 50 and up, if you’re in that area, we need you to sign up.” The Bluegrass State’s vaccination program is currently in phase 1C, which includes people 50 and older, anyone older than 16 with high-risk medical conditions, and anyone deemed an essential worker. Starting April 12, all residents 16 and older will be eligible for a shot.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: In response to updated federal guidance on social distancing in schools, officials have approved revisions to the state’s minimum COVID-19 health and safety standards for school facilities. Effective immediately, the revisions to the standards remove the specific physical distancing requirement of 6 feet and insert the provision that distancing requirements shall be in accordance with current Louisiana Department of Health guidelines, as informed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On March 19, the CDC updated its K-12 school guidance to reflect the latest science on physical distance between students in classrooms. The CDC now recommends that, with universal masking, students should maintain a distance of at least 3 feet in classroom settings. “Louisiana’s education leaders are committed to ensuring a safe and productive learning environment as we move incrementally toward the restoration of normal classroom and school operations,” said Sandy Holloway, president of the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education. Holloway’s approval of the revisions, by emergency rule under interim authority, is scheduled to be ratified by the full board at its next regular meeting April 21.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s lobster catch dipped slightly last year as fishermen dealt with the coronavirus pandemic, but the final totals were better than some feared. Fishermen caught more than 96 million pounds of lobsters in 2020, the Maine Department of Marine Resources said Wednesday. That total broke a string of nine consecutive years in which harvesters brought at least 100 million pounds of lobsters to land. Maine is by far the biggest lobster fishing state in the country, and the harvest is central to the state’s economy and heritage. Members of the industry feared at the outset of the pandemic that it would be difficult to equal previous years’ hauls because of the toll of the virus on the economy and the workforce. However, the 2020 catch would have been a state record as recently as 2010. Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen’s Association, said prices were also competitive despite difficulty shipping and worldwide economic turmoil caused by the pandemic. The industry focused on opening up domestic retail sales, such as at supermarkets, to keep prices strong, McCarron said. The industry also pivoted to more online direct-to-consumer sales. Some lobstermen even took to selling lobsters from tanks in their own garages and homes.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The U.S. Naval Academy has begun to ease restrictions that were put in place after an outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The Capital Gazette reports the academy in Annapolis is allowing food to be delivered again and midshipmen to perform outdoor meetings and formations. Student interaction is still limited to roommates with the exception of socially distanced formations outside. The school’s salon and barbershop, Midshipman store and other services will resume appropriate services. The academy had experienced an outbreak of the disease, and nearly 200 midshipmen were moved to local hotels in order to expand quarantine and isolation space. But there are still students in quarantine. And the number of cases isn’t decreasing fast enough to resume in-person classes, which will remain online through Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Nearly 60 school districts received permission from the state education commissioner to delay the resumption of full-time, in-person learning for elementary school-age children, which the state set for April 5, authorities say. The 58 districts that received a waiver include Brockton, Chelsea, Springfield and Somerville. Commissioner Jeffrey Riley is still weighing the requests of 10 other districts, including Boston and Worcester – the two largest in the state – The Boston Globe reports. Riley also denied requests from six districts, which the state would not identify. “We are pleased that 90% of districts will have their elementary schools back fully in-person by April 5, with all elementary schools in the Commonwealth fully in-person by May 3,” Riley said in a statement Tuesday. “Bringing all our kids back to school is crucial for their educational progress, emotional and social well-being, and we will continue to work with districts to bring students back ahead of their waiver-approved return dates.” The state has directed middle schools to fully reopen by April 28 and is still accepting waiver requests. A return date for high schools has not been scheduled.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A restaurant owner who likened the state’s coronavirus restrictions to her childhood in communist Eastern Europe was released Tuesday after four nights in jail for ignoring orders to shut down. Marlena Pavlos-Hackney paid a $15,000 fine and satisfied authorities that Marlena’s Bistro and Pizzeria in Holland finally would remain closed while it lacks a food license. Her supporters boarded up the doors but also turned the building into a symbol of defiance with signs such as “Stop the Injustice.” Some bars, restaurants, gyms and other businesses have been fined for violating Michigan’s restrictions during the pandemic. But Pavlos-Hackney’s arrest before dawn Friday broke new ground and angered her allies, especially Republican lawmakers. Pavlos-Hackney is “Michigan’s first political prisoner of the pandemic,” state Sen. Tom Barrett said on the Senate floor Tuesday, even offering to take her spot in jail. “Come in the broad daylight. I just need a minute to pack my toothbrush,” Barrett said, aiming his words at Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. State regulators yanked Pavlos-Hackney’s food license in January for serving indoor diners and breaking other rules related to preventing the spread of COVID-19. But the restaurant, 180 miles west of Detroit, stayed open – and customers flocked there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Twin Cities commercial real estate managers are fearful Target Corp.’s decision to leave a main downtown Minneapolis location will become a trend that will continue to diminish office space needs. Target informed the City Center’s manager this month that it will no longer need the 985,000 square feet of office space it rents in the 51-story tower because it is permanently moving to a hybrid remote work model for 3,500 employees. Target’s lease expires in 2031. The company said many headquarters employees are currently working remotely. The COVID-19 pandemic has darkened many buildings in the downtown business district as employees adjust to working at home to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Building managers are bracing for additional fallout from the big retailer’s decision to leave the City Center, the Star Tribune reports. A recent Cushman & Wakefield national survey revealed that 81% of employers across 35 markets expect to switch to a work-from-home model post-COVID-19. According to C&W, about 22% of Minneapolis’ core business district’s 28.4 million square feet of office space is vacant.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Jackson Convention Complex will host a mixed martial arts competition Saturday, its first big live-audience event since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down venues where large gatherings were commonplace. Oak View Group Facilities, the group that manages and operates the Jackson Convention Complex, announced in a news release that the venue will host the ongoing fight series, Empire Fighting Championship. The Empire FC X is a mixed martial arts event that will have 17 fights at the convention center. “Our team has been working tirelessly with local officials to ensure proper safety protocols are in place to have spectators attend an event here in at the Jackson Center Complex,” Mark Arancibia, general manager for Oak View Group Facilities, said in the news release. The convention center will have a limited capacity of 1,000 people for the event and will have predetermined, socially distanced sitting areas, Arancibia said. He said the Jackson Convention Complex has hosted some high school volleyball matches with spectators, but Saturday’s competition will be the first professional sporting event. Fans will be required to wear masks inside the convention center. There will also be hand sanitizing stations throughout the space.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: With COVID-19 cases on the decline and vaccinations on the rise, two mid-sized cities are easing restrictions. St. Joseph Mayor Bill McMurray on Monday ended the requirement to wear a mask, effective Wednesday, the St. Joseph News-Press reports. Meanwhile, in mid-Missouri, the health department for Columbia and Boone County is reducing restrictions on bars, restaurants and other businesses. McMurray initially opposed ending St. Joseph’s mandate but relented after the City Council voted 5-4 in support of doing away with it. The decision was ultimately McMurray’s because he had been given authority over the mandate earlier in the pandemic. Opponents of ending the mandate cited concerns about Buchanan County’s vaccination rate of 13%, one of the lowest in Missouri. “I hope everybody will exercise good judgment and wear their masks in situations that we are very close to people,” McMurray said. “We’re not out of the woods yet.” In Columbia, health director Stephanie Browning announced a new order that ends limits on the size of gatherings at bars, restaurants, entertainment venues and other businesses, the Columbia Daily Tribune reports. The order also eliminates limits on the number of spectators for sports and activities.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A sixth lawmaker has tested positive for the coronavirus during this year’s legislative session, COVID-19 panel chairman Sen. Jason Ellsworth said Tuesday. The identity of the lawmaker was not released. The legislator is quarantining away from the Capitol, according to a statement by Ellsworth. The legislator was last in the building “within the past few days” and tested positive “within the past day,” according to panel spokesperson Kyle Schmauch. More than a month has elapsed since legislative leaders last confirmed a positive test among lawmakers. Coronavirus testing for legislators and legislative staff is available inside the Capitol on a weekly basis. The Legislature’s COVID-19 panel, tasked with addressing coronavirus-related rules during the session, has not met in more than two months.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A scaled-down version of the Nebraska State Fair in 2020 finished with a nearly $1.8 million profit, a substantial improvement over a disastrous fair the previous year, according to an annual audit. An audit by BKD of Lincoln found last year’s fair had revenue of nearly $6.5 million, a drop of about 37% from 2019, The Lincoln Journal-Star reports. However, because fair officials chose not to have a carnival or paid entertainment in response to the coronavirus pandemic, expenses declined to $3.7 million, about $7 million less than in 2019. With other factors such as interest and depreciation, the fair ended with a net profit of about $1.8 million. The 2019 fair incurred a nearly $1.5 million loss after managers spent heavily on entertainment to celebrate the fair’s 150th anniversary before bad weather caused a sharp drop in attendance. Fair officials had to lay off nearly half the staff and take out $1.1 million in credit to cover bills. An audit taken after that fair said Patrick Kopke, the fair’s former chief of finance, paid nearly $150,000 to a company he created for services that weren’t performed. Kopke was charged with felony theft. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In his first trip since being confirmed, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited the state Tuesday to talk up the Affordable Care Act and efforts underway to expand coverage and reduce the cost of health care. The secretary is one of several surrogates President Joe Biden dispatched to drum up support for his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which includes funding for people who lost health care coverage amid the pandemic. “I hope Nevadans take full advantage of what it does to help middle class families on the edge” during the pandemic, Becerra said. At a Carson City health center, he announced an extension of the special enrollment period for the federal health insurance marketplace to Aug. 15. Former Gov. Brian Sandoval was one of the few Republican governors to create a state-based exchange and expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The law reduced the size of Nevada’s uninsured population drastically. Sandoval on Tuesday called the decision one of the most important he made as governor and said the politics “were not as complicated as one would think.” State lawmakers from both parties supported his approach due to Nevada’s high uninsured rate, he said. Amid the pandemic, Sandoval hopes state governments consider similar policies.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state will host its second mass vaccination site this weekend at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway. Vaccinations are by appointment only, and there were still slots for those eligible to schedule appointments at the state’s online site, VINI. The state hopes to vaccinate 8,000 people this weekend at the speedway. The site will be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. The Pfizer vaccine will be the only option offered. About 12,000 people were vaccinated at the first mass vaccination clinic at the speedway March 6-8.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Renters can now apply to receive up to a year’s worth of housing assistance after the state launched its online application for $353 million worth of grants for low- and moderate-income households behind on payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who have missed rental payments since March 13, 2020, can apply for assistance at the Department of Community Affairs website at njdca.onlinepha.com. The application site launched Monday at 9 a.m. and will remain open until the state receives enough applications to distribute all of the $353 million. More than 350,000 New Jersey households are behind on rent payments, according to U.S. census data from late February. Renters cannot be kicked out of their homes during New Jersey’s eviction moratorium, but landlords are still submitting tens of thousands of eviction filings in court for nonpayment of rent. Rental assistance payments could be distributed directly to landlords as early as May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Legislature is asserting its budgetary authority over $1.6 billion in new federal aid that dwarfs year-to-year spending adjustments, setting an agenda for economic recovery that Gov. Lujan Grisham could challenge with her veto pen. Congress and President Joe Biden approved the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package this month that funnels billions of dollars directly to New Mexico’s state government, school districts and local governments. A state Senate finance committee quickly channeled about $1 billion of that economic relief to accounts and initiatives that avoid future payroll tax increases on businesses, underwrite college tuition for in-state students, and backfill lost income at state museums and more. A final budget bill approved by the Legislature devotes federal relief of $600 million to replenishing the state’s unemployment trust fund. The fund began borrowing from the federal government last year to fulfill unprecedented unemployment claims. Lawmakers earmarked another $6 million for the state fair in Albuquerque, along with $14.5 million to bolster spending at state parks, historic sites and New Mexico’s world-renowned public museum system. Those facilities were closed down for much of the past year as a health precaution against the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie was one of two lawmakers who said they tested positive for the coronavirus Tuesday, though both Democrats said they were experiencing only mild symptoms. Assembly member Ron Kim of Queens announced his positive test on Twitter, saying he was in isolation. Kim has been one of the loudest voices calling for Gov. Andrew Cuomo to be impeached as the governor faces scandals revolving around the classification of nursing home deaths and allegations of sexual harassment. Kim said Cuomo had vowed to “destroy” him during a private phone call for nursing home criticism he felt was unfair. Cuomo has denied the allegation. Heastie, who represents the Bronx, said he would be working from his Albany residence as he and other leaders of the Legislature try to reach a state budget deal with Cuomo by the April 1 deadline. Heastie tested positive despite receiving the first of two vaccine doses March 6. It generally takes two weeks after a second dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for a person to build full protection. “I am in frequent contact with my physician and look forward to a full recovery,” Heastie said in a statement. The Assembly began meeting virtually when the pandemic struck last year to limit the spread of the virus among lawmakers and staff.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday eased several restrictions that will soon allow businesses to open at greater capacity and more people to assemble indoors and outdoors. Starting Friday, bars and sports and entertainment venues can open at 50% capacity indoors or outdoors, with the 11 p.m. cutoff for on-site alcohol consumption fully lifted. Restaurants, breweries, wineries, amusement parks, gyms and bowling alleys can fully reopen outdoors and at 75% capacity indoors. Museums, aquariums, retail businesses and shops, hair salons and personal care businesses can operate at 100% capacity indoors and outdoors. Gatherings not otherwise included in the updated executive order set to expire April 30 will increase to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. The statewide mask mandate will remain in place, and the required 6 feet of physical distancing may not allow businesses to reopen at the capacity caps outlined. “These are significant changes, but they can be done safely,” Cooper said at an afternoon news conference. The announcement comes as a handful of North Carolina counties have expanded COVID-19 vaccine eligibility to all adults, regardless of age, health condition or job type, due to limited demand in their areas.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A popcorn machine has been removed from the North Dakota Capitol after it twice triggered fire alarms that brought firefighters to the building this week and caused legislators to evacuate. Rep. Mary Johnson was on her third batch of popcorn Monday afternoon when the machine triggered the alarms for the second time that day. Johnson said she wasn’t aware of a policy that bans popcorn poppers, toasters and other food appliances from the building, with the exception of the Capitol Cafe. House Majority Leader Chet Pollert said the popcorn helped bring together House Republicans, whose caucus has been “a little strained” due to the coronavirus pandemic and the House expulsion of former Rep. Luke Simons, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Popcorn cheers people up for a reason,” Pollert said. “And now it’s gone, and that’s the way it goes.” Facility Management Director John Boyle said the policy was established to prevent the activation of fire alarms.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Multiple local health departments are sounding the alarm about legislation restricting their ability to respond to emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic. The agency heads laid out their concerns in letters to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday, documenting how the bill would slow down or block local officials from ordering businesses to close or requiring residents to quarantine or isolate without a medical diagnosis. “Board of health orders are crucial tools to mitigate a situation, allowing time for a full investigation of a situation before it becomes urgent or worsens,” Franklin County health officials wrote. “Orders like these are utilized sparingly and almost always involve guidance and expertise from the CDC or the Ohio Department of Health.” The department and several other public health agencies opposed Wednesday’s steps by House and Senate Republicans to override DeWine’s veto of the bill. But GOP legislators made good on their promise to check the authority of their fellow Republican by issuing the first override of his term after a yearlong battle over how the state should respond during a health emergency.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state Senate panel voted Monday to endorse the confirmation of Dr. Lance Frye as commissioner of the Oklahoma State Department of Health. The Senate Health and Human Services Committee’s vote on Gov. Kevin Stitt’s nominee sent the pick to the full Senate for a vote. A member of the Oklahoma National Guard, Frye previously served as residency program director and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oklahoma State University’s Center for Health Sciences. “His extensive medical and military experience is a reflection of his longstanding commitment to serving others in times of crisis and uncertainty,” Stitt said in a statement. “He was the right man for the job at the height of the pandemic, and I’m confident his leadership will continue to benefit the health and lives of Oklahomans.” Stitt’s last pick to lead the health department, Gary Cox, was forced to resign after the same Senate committee refused to take up his nomination last year. Meanwhile, newly reported coronavirus cases in Oklahoma continued to decline Wednesday, and the number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines was rising. The seven-day rolling average of new cases in Oklahoma dropped by 41.1% during the past two weeks, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three students have filed class-action lawsuits against the state’s two largest colleges saying they were charged full price for online classes of poorer quality than in-person classes. When the University of Oregon and Oregon State University closed their campuses because of the coronavirus pandemic, they didn’t offer to refund students’ tuition bills, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The University of Oregon says on its website that in order to provide quality education now and in the future, it cannot discount tuition. The universities did agree to refund portions of their room and board. “The University of Oregon, we believe, has unfairly continued to charge tuition payers for all of the things they were not allowed to experience and use during the COVID-19 campus closure and switch to online classes,” said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman and attorney for students in the class action. Caine Smith filed the suit against Oregon. Danielle Pranger and Garrett Harris filed the complaint against Oregon State. The suits, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court earlier this month, did not specify how much they are seeking in damages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: As life languished in the early days of the pandemic and most people stayed home, vandals left their mark in Philadelphia. The graffiti in March 2020 included multiple swastikas and other symbols of hate, including the white supremacist symbol “1488” that partially pledges allegiance to Hitler. And a disturbing message was found inside a public restroom in the city, which had a powerful Black voting bloc capable of determining the outcome of an election: “We need to re-implement Jim Crow.” Hate symbols found that day were among 330 incidents reported last year in Pennsylvania by the Anti-Defamation League – a record high since the ADL started tracking cases in the state five years ago. Most of the incidents involved white supremacist propaganda, while 96 were anti-Semitic incidents, and eight were white supremacist events. The findings line up with those noted by the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, the top civil rights agency in the state, and numerous personal experiences shared on social media. The accounts from individuals and agencies all illustrate an important point: As life slowed down during the pandemic, hate did not, experts said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s two largest hospital groups did not violate laws or break state policies when they offered COVID-19 vaccinations to their board members before they were eligible, but they did erode public confidence in the fairness of the vaccination process, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said Tuesday. Front-line health care workers were among the first people in Rhode Island to be eligible for a shot, but Lifespan and Care New England, after vaccinating workers at high risk of exposure, offered vaccinations to board members and some other employees, no matter their age or risk level. The move drew criticism from people who said many high-risk residents were being denied vaccinations and prompted the attorney general’s investigation. “The appearance or perception that certain connected or wealthy individuals were, by virtue of their seat on a hospital board of directors, being given an opportunity to ‘jump the line’ months in advance was upsetting to many and fueled anxiety among everyday Rhode Islanders who were dutifully waiting their turn,” the attorney general wrote in a letter to management at both organizations and the state Department of Health. However, the state gave the hospital groups wide discretion on whom they should vaccinate, the letter said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The South Carolina House gave key approval Tuesday to the state’s $9.8 billion budget, which provides small raises for most teachers and some law enforcement officers but not for other state employees. Republican leaders promised either a bonus or a raise for most lower-paid state employees if somewhat rosier predictions about the state’s economy recovering from the COVID-19 downturn come true after taxes are collected this spring. “To make sure we thank state employees and we recognize their hard work and their sacrifice – we need to do that with an increase in their pay,” said Rep. Murrell Smith, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes the budget. Smith said if for some reason tax collection isn’t enough to ensure revenue every year for a raise, he will push for a bonus. Smith was responding to Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who made her annual trip to the front of the House to ask for the raises. “State employees are pretty fed up with being told to wait until next year,” the Democrat from Orangeburg said. State employees appreciated the praise for working through the pandemic. But “there’s no paper that goes along with that praise,” Cobb-Hunter said. She promised she would ask for a 5% raise later this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Students will again miss out on school-sanctioned prom this year because of COVID-19 precautions but can instead celebrate with a “grand march” at their school. Still, that’s not stopping parents and students from hosting off-site, unsanctioned prom events. Carly Uthe, a spokesperson for the Sioux Falls School District, said in an email Monday that the district began discussing prom in January, and district leaders and high school principals decided by February that the grand march opportunity would still “provide seniors with a memorable experience with their classmates.” The sheer number of seniors at each school and the need for social distancing and mask-wearing led officials to determine a dance would not comply with health and safety protocols, Uthe said. But that’s not enough for some. To make the end of high school memorable for their seniors, parents at Sioux Falls’ high schools are hosting proms on their own dime. Lincoln High School parents plan an “Underground Prom” at The Social, a local event venue. Washington High School’s unsanctioned prom will be held at the Convention Center. Roosevelt High School is combining a prom and senior party into one event at the South Dakota Military Heritage Alliance. Parents with all three said masks will be required at their proms.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Citing demand slack for COVID-19 vaccinations, the city of Memphis and Shelby County announced Monday that COVID-19 vaccine eligibility would expand to everyone 16 and up, with appointments opening Friday for vaccinations next week. The move is a long-awaited one for thousands of people who haven‘t been eligible for a vaccine because they weren’t old enough or didn’t have preexisting conditions. It also marks the start of the final push toward herd immunity from COVID-19 and an attempt to return to some sort of normalcy. “Our aim is to get as many shots into as many arms as fast as we possibly can. And the phenomenon that we were seeing was not only were we not having all of our appointments filled, but we were having people double-book and triple-book appointments and then being no-shows,” said Doug McGowen, the city’s chief operating officer and leader of vaccine efforts for Shelby County. The move toward eligibility for nearly everyone could lead to demand outstripping supply again, something that hasn’t been the case over the past few weeks, as the city and county have had to put out repeated calls for appointments to be filled. McGowen said Tuesday that the public may need to be patient when appointments open to everyone Friday.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Launching a legal fight against a fellow Republican, state Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller has sued Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick – as well as the entire Texas Senate – in a bid to strike down a rule requiring visitors to the chamber to take a coronavirus test. Senate rules require a negative test, conducted in a tent outside the Capitol’s north entrance, before anybody can walk onto the Senate floor, sit in the overhead gallery or enter a Senate committee room for a hearing. Joined by conservative GOP activist Steven Hotze of Houston, Miller’s lawsuit seeks a court order striking down the testing requirement as a violation of free speech and the right to petition the government as protected by the Texas Constitution. “Government power cannot be exercised in conflict with the constitution, even in a pandemic,” said the lawsuit, filed in state District Court in Travis County. “Texas law does not and cannot empower Patrick or the Texas Senate to impose a medical test before one is able to participate in their government.” Patrick, who presides over the Senate, praised the rule shortly after it was unanimously adopted by senators in January at the start of the legislative session, saying it would protect senators, staff and visitors alike.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: All Utah adults can now begin signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine, with the state having accelerated its timetable for opening the shots up to younger age groups. Previously, vaccines were only available to people 50 or older, along with health care workers, teachers, care facility staff and select other groups. Gov. Spencer Cox announced last week that the vaccines would be available to younger people sooner because as much as 15% of the state’s supply wasn’t being claimed by those in the eligible age groups. State health officials say nearly 1.2 million vaccines have been administered statewide, with about 25,000 per day reported over the past week. Some teenagers 16 and older were also eligible under the new rules. Cox urged people to try to sign up quickly, saying the sudden change in eligibility rules would likely mean there won’t be enough vaccines for all of those interested. But the goal was to use every vaccine available without letting any go to waste, Cox said. “We always want to keep demand above availability,” the Republican governor said during a televised news conference on PBS-Utah.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Amtrak passenger rail service could be back on track in the state within the next few months, officials said. Service on the two trains that serve Vermont – The Vermonter, which runs from Washington, D.C., up the eastern side of Vermont before crossing the state and then ending in St. Albans, and the Ethan Allen Express, which travels between Rutland and New York City – was suspended last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. “We’ve had some preliminary discussions with Amtrak on this, and we had said that we’re looking forward to them coming back and being fully operational,” Scott said Tuesday during his COVID-19 briefing. “We just don’t know exactly when it’s going to be.” Amy Tatko, a spokeswoman for the Vermont Agency of Transportation, told the St. Albans Messenger that restart talks are underway. “We hope to make an announcement within the next several weeks as to what that timeline will look like,” she said. Despite the suspension of service, Amtrak trains have been operating on the Vermont lines to train staff.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said Tuesday that the state will soon relax some coronavirus-related restrictions for social gatherings and entertainment venues. Starting April 1, Northam said, social gatherings such as weddings may have up to 50 people indoors. Outdoor gatherings can have up to 100 people. Indoor entertainment venues will be able to operate at 30% capacity or with up to 500 people. Outdoor venues can operate at a 30% capacity with no limits on the actual number of people. For example, a baseball stadium that holds 9,500 fans will be able to host a crowd of roughly 3,000. That will give people room to socially distance, Northam said. Indoor recreational sporting events will be able to have 100 people per field or 30% capacity. Outdoor events will be able to accommodate 500 people per field or 30% capacity. “These are measured changes,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. “We still have a strict gathering limit and a universal mask mandate and capacity restrictions both indoors and outdoors.” Social gatherings in the state are currently limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors. Some in the wedding business say relaxing the limits to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors may still be too restrictive.\n\nWashington\n\nWoodland: The state Department of Labor and Industries has fined this southwest Washington city for potentially exposing staff to COVID-19 when councilmembers went without face masks during meetings. According to the citation received Friday, Woodland did not comply with the governor’s COVID-19 emergency proclamation banning businesses from operating unless all customers inside the building are wearing facial coverings, The Daily News of Longview reports. “Despite councilmembers choosing not to wear facial coverings at all times, the city continued to facilitate these meetings and expose their employees to the potential spread of COVID-19,” the citation said. “Continued operations in contravention of the orders of the governor unnecessarily endangers employees and creates a substantial probability that death or serious harm could result.” The violation was corrected during the L&I inspection, according to the citation. Woodland Mayor Will Finn could not be reached for comment Monday. Last year, the state received complaints from citizens and staff about people not wearing masks during council meetings. The council has held mostly in-person meetings since June 1, after voting unanimously May 20 to do so “regardless of Gov. (Jay) Inslee’s stay-at-home order.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s vaccination campaign will turn to young people to stem transmission rates after giving shots to most senior citizens. The new strategy to focus on shots for residents ages 16 to 29 comes after officials said they are seeing an increase in doses delivered. “When you have the resources available, you open up multiple fronts against the enemy to deplete their capability,” James Hoyer, a retired major general leading the state’s coronavirus task force, said Wednesday. “In this case the virus is the enemy.” Republican Gov. Jim Justice said more than 70% of residents 65 and over are at least partially vaccinated, but he set a new goal of covering 85% of that population. But he said the state’s focus could now begin shifting to high school and college students and other young adults. “We’re seeing significant transmission occurring with our younger people,” Justice said. He opened up vaccinations to all West Virginians 16 and up Monday. Dr. Clay Marsh, the state’s coronavirus czar, said younger and older people are turning up sicker at hospitals, which he attributed to variants of the coronavirus circulating. The number of coronavirus patients has increased 40% in under two weeks to 212 people.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos called on the state’s business community to “step up” and return workers to offices around the Fourth of July, joining Wednesday with the state Senate’s top Republican in praising Wisconsin’s COVID-19 vaccination efforts. Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu offered rare praise for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration, giving it credit for increasing vaccinations. During the virtual event hosted by Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobbying group, they also pushed for a return to pre-pandemic work routines. “We don’t keep people going through all this rigmarole, which was necessary for a certain amount of time, but we’re now moving beyond it,” Vos said. “It’s up to the business community to step up with government to show the world that we can safely reopen and not have this pandemic hangover really impact our economy going forward in way that none of us want.” Vos’ call for people to return to offices echoes President Joe Biden earlier this month raising the possibility of beginning to “mark our independence from this virus” by the Fourth of July. “That’s the date that I’m looking at,” Vos said. “Kind of that, really, kick start of summer where the vast majority of people want to be outside.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State lawmakers are working on competing proposals to address a projected $300 million shortfall in K-12 education funding over the next two years and are looking to solutions for a longer-term deficit in school funding. The state’s rainy day fund of about $1.3 billion is available to cover the short-term shortfall. But House legislators are working on a bill that would phase in cuts of about $68 million over the next three years, and a Senate proposal would cut $130 million from the school finance model, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Lawmakers are working on a solution with two weeks left in the legislative session. House lawmakers also are discussing a proposal to raise the state sales tax from 4% to 5% once the state’s primary savings account falls below $650 million. The rainy-day fund could reach that threshold as soon as the 2023-24 biennium, legislative staff estimate. Many senators want to explore other possible cuts before supporting tax increases. One proposal includes increasing class sizes. The House bill is set for a final reading this week, with several amendments possible. Lawmakers will likely use that legislation to bridge the difference between the two chambers, according to Senate Education Committee chair Charles Scott of Casper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/10/republican-debate-live-fact-check/72153621007/", "title": "DeSantis and Haley debate fact check: Separating lies from truth", "text": "Two Republican presidential candidates were on the stage in Des Moines Wednesday night for the final debate before the Iowa caucuses begin.\n\nThe USA TODAY Fact Check Team dug into the claims from Florida Gov.

Instead, it would require automakers to \"limit the greenhouse gas emissions coming from their fleets – which could be done by making more of their vehicles electric or by upgrading the gasoline-powered engines in their cars,\" according to The Hill.\n\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\n\nThe proposal does not specify how automakers should meet the new emissions requirements, as USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nIn December, House Republicans voted in favor of legislation intended to block the Biden administration's proposal from being enacted. That legislation, though, is unlikely to go anywhere with Democrats in control of the Senate. Biden has also promised to veto it if it reaches his desk.\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nNikki Haley claim: 31% of America’s 8th graders are proficient in reading, 27% in math\n\nThe figures Haley cited are largely in line with 2022 findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which is known as the “nation’s report card.”\n\nThe assessment found 31% of eighth-grade students performed at or above the NAEP’s proficient level on the reading assessment. In math, the percentage of eighth-graders performing at or above the proficient level was 26% nationally.\n\nThe 2022 results showed “historic learning setbacks” following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBut be careful interpreting those figures. A 2016 commentary published by the Brookings Institution cautioned against using NAEP’s proficient level as a basis for education policy, noting the terms can be misunderstood. The article explained that “NAEP officials urge that proficient not be interpreted as reflecting grade level work. It is a standard set much higher than that.”\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nRon DeSantis claim: 8 million migrants have entered the US illegally since Biden took office\n\n\"Biden’s let in 8 million people just in four years. They all have to go back.”\n\nThis claim is false. Since Biden took office in January 2021, there have been more than 8 million encounters at U.S. borders, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nBut “encounters” simply refer to the number of times migrants were encountered at a border; it does not refer to the number of people who entered the country. One migrant could attempt to enter the country multiple times, creating multiple encounters, without being admitted to the U.S. That 8 million figure also includes encounters that occurred at the U.S.-Canada border.\n\nData released by the Department of Homeland Security in January shows that more than 2.3 million migrants have been released into the U.S. at the southern border since Biden took office. More than 6 million migrants were taken into custody in the same period. Both figures are below the 8 million claimed by DeSantis.\n\n– Brad Sylvester\n\nNikki Haley claim: Florida has the highest cost of living in the country\n\n“It’s the highest cost of living of any state in the country”\n\nThis is false. Florida had the 22nd-highest cost of living out of the 50 states and Washington, D.C., in the third quarter of 2023, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center’s cost of living data series. The center found Hawaii, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C., had the highest cost of living, respectively, while West Virginia, Mississippi and Oklahoma had the lowest, respectively.\n\nCost of living refers to the necessary expenses required to maintain a certain standard of living in a given place. These expenses usually include things like housing, food, taxes, healthcare, education and transportation.\n\n– Brad Sylvester\n\nNikki Haley claim: DeSantis gave Disney the 'largest corporate subsidies' in Florida history\n\n\"He gave them the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history.\"\n\nThe tax credits would have been the largest in state history, but the deal was never completed.\n\nHaley is referring to the up to $570 million in tax credits over 20 years that Disney would have been eligible for had it followed through on plans to invest as much as $864 million to build a regional headquarters in Orlando’s Lake Nona community and move at least 2,000 employees, with average salaries of $120,000, from California, the Tampa Bay Times reported.\n\nHowever, Disney announced in May that it was scrapping the plan and, as a result, passed on the chance to earn the $570 million in tax credits. If those tax credits had been paid out in full, it would have been \"the largest documented corporate tax incentive the Florida government has approved for a single project,\" the Tampa Bay Times reported, citing data from Good Jobs First, a research center that tracks government tax credits and subsidies for corporations.\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nRon DeSantis claim: South Carolina gave China land while Nikki Haley was governor\n\n“When she was governor of South Carolina, the state gave China land.”\n\nThis gets the details wrong. A county in South Carolina – not the state – made a deal in 2016 with a Chinese maker of fiberglass products, according to Wisconsin Watch, which fact-checked a similar claim in a pro-DeSantis campaign ad.\n\nRichland County, South Carolina, agreed to give China Jushi 197 acres only if the company made agreed-upon investments in jobs and money, KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa, reported in November 2023. The company ultimately met those requirements and received the land.\n\nThe minutes from that county council meeting outline the terms of the deal made by the council’s chairman – not the governor or any state official.\n\nHaley did praise the company’s announcement of 400 jobs and a $300 million investment in a 2016 Facebook post.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Florida has the lowest percentage of state workers per capita in the country\n\n“Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country.”\n\nThis is accurate. Florida has 82 full-time equivalent state workers per 10,000 population, according to the state’s most recent Department of Management Services Annual Workforce report. That is the lowest rate in the U.S., where the national average in 2021 was 198 per 10,000 population.\n\nFlorida has a total of about 165,000 state employees, according to the report. The state’s workforce also has the lowest payroll cost per state resident in the country at $40. It is followed by Arizona at $53 and Nevada at $54.\n\n- Brad Sylvester\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Haley stood 'in front of a Chinese flag saying she works for them now'\n\n\"There’s a video of her in front a Chinese flag saying she works for them now.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis is referring to video of former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley celebrating a deal that, as CBS News reported, led to the construction of a South Carolina-based production plant for a Chinese fiberglass company in 2016.\n\n\"I told them that if they would do this, that South Carolina would wrap their arms around them and take care of them,\" Haley said, addressing the company. \"I now officially work for you.\"\n\nThe company, China Jushi, invested $300 million in its first U.S. plant on 200 acres in Columbia, South Carolina. The project created at least 400 jobs, according to the South Carolina Department of Commerce.\n\nChina Jushi is partially owned by a Chinese government enterprise with ties to the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhang Yuqiang, the CEO of China Jushi in 2016, serves as the committee secretary for the company's communist party committee.\n\n\"It's a great day in South Carolina,\" Haley says in a 2016 video message played at a signing ceremony in China to celebrate the deal and later obtained by ABC News. \"I am so sorry I'm not there with you in person to celebrate what is a fantastic announcement by the Jushi Group.\"\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nRon DeSantis claim: Haley attempted to raise South Carolina’s tax on gasoline\n\n“She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax.”\n\nHaley responded to this claim by asserting that DeSantis distorted what happened near the end of her term as South Carolina’s governor.\n\nShe proposed in 2015 and 2016 to raise the gasoline tax – but it was paired with a cut of income taxes, according to PolitiFact. And because neither proposal passed, those taxes did not change.\n\nHer 2016 budget proposal included a gas tax increase of 10 cents per gallon that would have been offset by a cut in the state income tax from 7% to 5%, WSPA-TV in Spartanburg, South Carolina, reported.\n\n“I’m going to veto anything that is a net tax increase,” she said at the time, adding that the $131 million drop in income taxes would have made up for the $49 million in additional gas tax collections.\n\nThe president of Americans for Tax Reform, an advocacy group that pushes for lower taxes, in 2015 urged South Carolina lawmakers to support it, emphasizing the net tax decrease, The Post and Courier of Charleston reported.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nNikki Haley claim: 87,000 IRS agents are ‘going after middle America’\n\nHaley repeated this misleading figure from her November 2023 GOP debate appearance. The 87,000 refers to a suggestion in a May 2021 U.S. Treasury Department report that included a proposal of what the Internal Revenue Service could do with an additional $80 billion in funding.\n\nThe IRS says audit rates on average households will not change, CNN reported in April. The money would help the IRS go after fighting high-end tax evasion, officials said.\n\nOne proposal would hire that many employees over the course of a decade – but not all at once. They would replace others in the agency’s aging workforce who have retired. The IRS has lost roughly 50,000 workers in five years due to attrition, The Associated Press reported.\n\n– Andre Byik and Joedy McCreary\n\nRon DeSantis claim: He delivered on all of his campaign promises in Florida\n\n“I’m the only one running who’s delivered on 100% of the promises I’ve made.”\n\nThis is false, and it’s the second straight debate in which DeSantis has brought it up. He has followed through on some of his campaign promises since being elected governor in 2018, but he has not fulfilled all of them, according to PolitiFact’s “DeSant-O-Meter” scorecard.\n\nHis most prominent broken campaign promises relate to tax cuts. In 2018, DeSantis pledged to work to lower the corporate tax rate in Florida, and while it temporarily dropped from 2019 to 2021 primarily as the result of federal changes, it returned to 5.5% in 2022 – the same tax rate it was before DeSantis took office.\n\nThe governor also failed to follow through on his pledge to lower Florida’s communication services tax, which is assessed on telecommunications, audio and video streaming, direct-to-home satellite and related services. Florida consistently has one of the highest such taxes in the country, a fact which has not changed since DeSantis took office.\n\n-Brad Sylvester and Joedy McCreary\n\nPrior fact checks: Haley debate claims cover track record, policy\n\nAs we count down to the start of the debate, here’s a look back at what we’ve debunked in prior debates.\n\nHaley’s claims in the four GOP debates in 2023 ranged from her tenure as South Carolina’s governor to domestic policy to foreign affairs.\n\nShe misleadingly claimed 87,000 IRS agents are “going after middle America,” misstated the nature of a survey that suggests TikTok is driving a surge of antisemitism and overstated how far South Carolina’s unemployment rate fell during her governorship.\n\nHaley also falsely claimed DeSantis banned fracking in Florida, and she overstated the known casualty count in Ukraine.\n\nBut she correctly stated that the national debt increased by about $8 trillion during Donald Trump’s presidency, that 11 European countries have given more aid to Ukraine in terms of GDP than the U.S., and that fentanyl has killed more Americans than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\n– Andre Byik\n\nPrior fact checks: DeSantis’ debate claims stem from record as Florida governor\n\nDeSantis made an array of claims during the four GOP debates in 2023, many focusing on his record as governor of Florida.\n\nIn touting his record as the state’s top elected official, DeSantis falsely claimed he has delivered on all of his campaign promises, repeated a false claim that crime in his state is at a 50-year low and said his COVID-19 policies “led the country out of lockdown.”\n\nHe also mischaracterized Haley’s proposed reforms for legal immigration and wrongly claimed the Biden Administration wants to get rid of cash.\n\nIn addition, DeSantis has twice brought up an anecdote about a toddler who died after being exposed to fentanyl at an Airbnb property in Florida and referenced his executive order that directed the state to help Americans in Israel who were stranded due to the conflict with Hamas.\n\nBut he did not claim to have been a Navy SEAL, contrary to a social media post that includes an image from liberal group Occupy Democrats.\n\n– Joedy McCreary\n\nAbortion sparks debate, misinformation after Roe v. Wade ruling\n\nAbortion rights are likely to be a key issue for voters as the 2024 presidential election nears.\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision in June 2022, eliminating the constitutional right to have an abortion, more than a dozen states have banned, or attempted to ban, abortion. Meanwhile, progressive organizations and activists have scored seven straight victories in statewide ballots, most recently in Ohio.\n\nDemocrats have sought to use the issue to mobilize voters ahead of the 2024 election. Republican presidential candidates have generally been opposed to the procedure, but vary in how they would try to regulate it if elected.\n\nTrump has suggested he would work with “both sides” of the abortion issue and has denounced total restrictions on abortions. He criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signing of legislation banning abortion after six weeks in his state. At the third GOP presidential debate in Miami, Haley said she considers herself \"pro-life\" but believes abortion is “a personal issue for every woman and every man.\n\nAbortion has sparked a consistent flow of misinformation online:\n\n– BrieAnna Frank & Hannah Hudnall\n\nDebate background: Jan. 6 riot remains part of campaign\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot continues to loom over the field of GOP presidential candidates, even though none of the debate participants had direct ties to the storming of the Capitol or the certification of election results that day.\n\nThe candidates participating in tonight’s debate have largely agreed that those responsible for the events at the Capitol should be held accountable, although Ron DeSantis has balked at calling it an insurrection.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has brought the events forward again by releasing footage from the Capitol, a process slowed by his decision to blur the faces of rioters. The released video was co-opted into the steady flow of misinformation surrounding the riot.\n\nHere are some claims we’ve previously debunked:\n\n– Nate Trela\n\nDebate background: Supreme Court will rule on Trump ballot dispute\n\nMisinformation has spread online about removing candidates from ballots, including in a claim that wrongly compares Trump’s situation to Abraham Lincoln’s in 1860. Our fact check notes Lincoln was not removed from any ballots.\n\nThe same can't be said for former President Donald Trump at this stage, though plenty of legal challenges await.\n\nIn late December, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled Trump would not be allowed to appear on the state's presidential primary ballot because of his role inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump has appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear arguments in February, before most states hold their primaries.\n\nMaine became the second state to remove Trump from its primary ballot after the state's top election official, a Democrat, decided the \"insurrectionist ban\" in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution applies to Trump – the same reason he was removed from the ballot in Colorado. In response, Trump sued, calling the official a \"biased decisionmaker.\"\n\nThere have been efforts in other states to remove Trump from the primary ballot, including Illinois and Massachusetts. California's top election official, though, has said Trump will remain on the ballot there, and Michigan's highest court rejected an appeal after a lower court decided political parties can put whichever candidate they choose on primary ballots.\n\n– Chris Mueller\n\nDebate background: Talk of Trump indictments, civil trial persists despite absence\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to loom large over the two Republican hopefuls on the debate stage.\n\nTrump has not taken part in any debates during this election cycle and is holding a town hall instead of participating in this one. Yet he remains the party’s central figure in light of both his commanding lead in the polls and his unprecedented legal troubles.\n\nMuch of Trump’s focus has been on his civil fraud trial in New York, where prosecutors claim he committed fraud by inflating the value of his assets and are seeking an estimated $250 million in damages, among other penalties. A gag order was restored against the former president who has called the trial a “scam” and a “disgrace” and asserted the judge who ruled he committed fraud knew nothing about him.\n\nThe series of prosecutions against Trump began in March, when he was indicted for allegedly falsifying business records related to hush-money payments intended to silence two women before the 2016 election. Trump also faces charges for allegedly mishandling classified documents and allegedly conspiring to steal the 2020 presidential election, including his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump and several allies were indicted in August by a Georgia grand jury that accused them of trying to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state, where Trump lost to President Joe Biden by about 12,000 votes.\n\nBoth Trump's candidacy and his legal woes have been the subject of an array of false or misleading claims on social media:\n\n– Joedy McCreary", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/15/cave-sale-brothel-lawsuit-killer-gator-caught-news-around-states/118822502/", "title": "$2.2M cave sale, brothel lawsuit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: A project to light the Edmund Pettus Bridge – an iconic structure for its role in the struggle for civil rights – could be completed by next summer, organizers say. The Rev. Mike Lewis of the Selma Bridge Lights Project gave an update on the timeline last week. Lewis had proposed the idea in 2017 as a way of attracting more people to visit the city, The Selma Times-Journal reports. About 600 protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a day in 1965 that became known as Bloody Sunday. The late civil rights leader John Lewis, leading the demonstrators across the bridge in a protest for voting rights, was knocked to the ground and beaten by law enforcement officers. The violence on the bridge focused the nation’s attention on racial oppression in the South. “When people think of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, they think of Selma. The lighting of the Edmund Pettus Bridge will honor the foot soldiers and civil rights,” the Rev. Mike Lewis said. There are plans to have different lights for various occasions, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Rental rates across the state have risen during the pandemic, and it’s more difficult to find an apartment, a new study indicates. The Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development survey shows a median adjusted rent for all unit types in Alaska at $1,179 a month in 2021, a 2% increase from spring 2020, Alaska Public Media reports. Sitka had the highest median rental rate at $1,323, the survey shows, while Wrangell and Petersburg were the lowest at $950. In Anchorage, the state’s largest city, the rent was $1,172, up 2.8% over 2020. The largest increase came in Ketchikan, where the average rent rose nearly 10% to $1,230 this year. However, the survey notes that electricity and water rates had just been approved at the time of the survey, and that anticipated increase might have been a factor. Vacancy rates dropped almost everywhere across the state. State economist Rob Krieger said that amid the pandemic, fewer people moved to a new rental, and there were fewer people shifting from renting to buying their first home. Rising home purchase prices and low interest rates are also making it difficult for first-time buyers in a competitive housing market, “especially when you consider that an average mortgage payment is now significantly higher than the average rent,” Krieger said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Political wonks and interested citizens can help draw the state’s new congressional and legislative districts. Mapping software made available by the Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission will allow computer users to examine new rough drafts of the districts combined with the latest census data. More tech-savvy folks can tinker with the software, at tiny.cc/arizmap, to create new district boundaries based on population and demographics, then submit their handiwork to the commission, which may use some of the ideas in the commission’s final maps. The five-member commission conducted 15 “listening tour” events around the state in July and August and is scheduled to discuss and adopt grid maps at its Tuesday meeting. Those maps look nothing like the final redistricting maps, displaying contiguous boxes that contain roughly equal portions of Arizona’s more than 7 million inhabitants, as based on the 2020 census. The maps split the population evenly among the nine congressional and 30 legislative districts. With this raw clay, plus the ideas heard and yet to be heard from the public in the coming weeks, the commissioners will redraw the boundaries for the next 10 years. Hearings on the draft maps will continue through November, with the final product coming out the next month.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 31 more COVID-19 deaths and 646 new cases Monday. The Department of Health said the state’s death toll from the coronavirus since the pandemic began rose to 7,298. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said 12 of the newly reported deaths Monday were delayed reports from before the previous 24 hours. The state’s COVID-19 hospitalizations dipped slightly, by five, to 1,113. Arkansas ranks 15th in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. There are 443 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state and 246 on ventilators. The department said 40 ICU beds are available in the state, though it’s unclear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLivermore: About 3,100 acres of open space in the San Francisco Bay Area could soon be preserved as a state park under a $31 million deal struck by Bay Area lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom. The deal would keep the area from becoming part of a neighboring off-road vehicle park. The agreement has been cast as a way to safeguard the ecological and cultural significance of the land east of Livermore, Democratic Sen. Steve Glazer of Orinda, who has advocated for the land’s preservation since 2018, said in a statement. The land known as the Tesla parcel borders the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area, which had planned to expand into the land, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Scientists say the land is a “biologically unique habitat,” and Native Americans consider it a “sensitive historical site,” Glazer’s office said in a statement. Under the agreement, the state would reimburse the Off-Highway Vehicle Trust Fund for the land and other costs and pay for development of a new off-roading park elsewhere. The land, home to several threatened and endangered wildlife species, is designated a California Native Plant Society Botanical Priority Protection Area and has been deemed an Audubon Important Bird Area. It is named after the historic town and Tesla coal mine established on the site in the 19th century.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state Supreme Court ruled Monday that police officers violated a man’s constitutional rights when they installed a video camera on a utility pole near his home and spied on him for months without getting a search warrant. The justices said the 24-hour-a-day, 3-month-long surveillance of the Colorado Springs man’s front yard, house, driveway and part of his backyard violated his Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, The Denver Post reports. His conviction and 15-year-prison sentence for drug trafficking were overturned. The unanimous decision differentiates between police officers personally watching suspects and officers using technology to record a person’s every move for extended periods of time. The man had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his yard, even though parts of the area were visible to the public, the court found. And the Colorado Springs Police Department should have received a search warrant before setting up the camera, which could pan and zoom to see over the man’s 6-foot-tall fence. The justices also rejected the state’s argument that the surveillance wasn’t as intrusive as GPS tracking or the use of cellphone data, noting that constant surveillance “shares many of the troubling attributes of GPS tracking.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: For years, many Native American tribes have felt their history has not been given its due by schools in Connecticut, a state that takes its name from an Algonquian word meaning “land on the long tidal river.” Soon, however, schools will be required to teach Native American studies, with an emphasis on local tribes, under a law passed this year at the urging of tribes including the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, best known today for its Foxwoods Resort Casino. “When you’re in Connecticut, to not learn about the Eastern woodland tribes, the tribes that Connecticut was founded on, (that) was the issue that we were pressing,” said Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequots. The legislation makes it mandatory for schools to teach Native American studies starting with the 2023-2024 school year. It passed despite concerns raised by teachers unions and state Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona. Now the U.S. education secretary, Cardona had said it is important to teach about Native Americans, but he was wary of unfunded mandates for school districts that are still working to implement other courses that lawmakers and the governor have required them to teach.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Beebe Healthcare and Tidal Health will temporarily pause elective surgeries due to spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations, officials said Monday. Beebe’s announcement, which went into effect Tuesday, is “out of an abundance of caution,” officials said. In the early weeks of the pandemic, nearly all Delaware hospitals paused elective procedures, but they resumed them months later. TidalHealth also announced Monday that its hospitals would temporarily stop “elective, non-emergency surgeries that require an overnight stay for at least a two-week period,” according to a news release. “Several factors have combined recently to put stress on hospital staffing levels and hospital bed capacity at both TidalHealth hospitals,” officials said. Since August, Delaware has seen an explosion of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. As of Monday, 266 people were hospitalized in the state – heights Delaware has not seen since the winter. Nearly all of the people being hospitalized for COVID-19 are unvaccinated, health officials say.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police have taken several steps to prepare their departments and the city as a whole in advance of a rally planned at the Capitol on Saturday in support of Jan. 6 defendants, WUSA-TV reports. USCP officers were seen installing surveillance cameras around the area of the U.S. Capitol on Monday morning. Some areas near the home of the legislative branch have already been boarded up, and several robotic cameras were placed at different locations. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. “We are here to protect everyone’s First Amendment right to peacefully protest,” USCP Chief Tom Manger said in a statement. “I urge anyone who is thinking about causing trouble to stay home. We will enforce the law and not tolerate violence.” Manger said a fence will go up around the Capitol again a few days before the rally and come down soon after if everything is peaceful. The Metropolitan Police Department has also activated its entire force and postponed vacation days for its officers. The full activation alert assigned specific notice to MPD civil disturbance units trained for First Amendment demonstrations.\n\nFlorida\n\nJacksonville: Attorney Mike Freed has left his mark locally cultivating an annual series of marathons raising money for Jacksonville Area Legal Aid. Now he’s asking lawyers around the country to donate their time to help to prevent a deluge of evictions rooted in the pandemic’s effect on jobs and incomes. “Sometimes you have to give up your time without compensation for the greater good,” said Freed, who is president of the National Conference of Bar Presidents, an organization involving Bar associations in 53 states and U.S. territories. Freed, an attorney at the Gunster law firm who organizes a yearly six-day series of six marathons called Freed to Run, used online messages to highlight a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland asking lawyers to prevent an eviction tsunami, writing that “no matter where you live, lawyers and law students like you can apply your legal training and skills to help your community.” Coming days after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out a federal moratorium on evictions during the pandemic, the pleas reacted to a situation that is growing more dire for many tenants. In Duval County, judges hearing eviction lawsuits last month issued 530 orders for police to serve writs of possession and take homes back from renters. Landlords filed another 737 eviction lawsuits last month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCalhoun: A northwest Georgia county is negotiating an agreement for its employees to work extra at the local hospital, which is over capacity due to COVID-19 patients. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reports Gordon County commissioners are near a deal to let county employees assist at AdventHealth Gordon when not working for the county. The hospital would pay the employees. County Administrator Jim Ledbetter said a number of firefighters and law enforcement personnel are interested. People who volunteer to work extra hours must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before their first shifts. “With the hospital being licensed for 69 patients and having more than 100, the labor force is stretched pretty thin, and staff are pretty tired,” Ledbetter said. “The hospital came to us for help, and we decided to do what we can.” Ledbetter said the county will require employees have at least 12 hours’ rest between their county shifts and hospital work. He said hospital doctors and nurses will supervise county employees. He said duties might include stocking supplies and making sure people are wearing masks before coming in. “They would help with security. People’s nerves have been frayed with the pandemic, and they don’t always want to mask. Some people have been getting testy about that,” Ledbetter said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The median sale price for a single-family home on the island of Oahu has surpassed $1 million. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the median price in August reached $1,050,000, according to Honolulu Board of Realtors data. “Market conditions have been pointing to a $1M median single-family home price this year for some time,” Jason Lazzerini, president and CEO of the brokerage firm Locations, wrote in a report last month. The Honolulu Board of Realtors said the record was up 25% from $839,000 in the same month last year. The August peak for single-family homes was the seventh monthly record set this year. The islands of Kauai and Maui hit the million-dollar mark in January and May, respectively. Hawaii economist Paul Brewbaker said that “this is not a bubble” and that he expects the demand will eventually ease. “This is transitory,” Brewbaker said. “We need to put that in perspective.” He said demand has been driven in part by stay-at-home workers during the pandemic. Honolulu Board of Realtors President Shannon Heaven said the August spike was driven by a tripling of homes sold for more than $2 million. “Those really begin to push that median price up,” she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An arrest warrant has been issued for a former state lawmaker who resigned in disgrace after a 19-year-old intern reported that he brought her to his apartment on false pretenses and raped her. The Ada County arrest warrant on charges of rape and sexual penetration with a foreign object came nearly five months after Aaron von Ehlinger, R-Lewiston, resigned from the Idaho House of Representatives after an ethics committee found he should be formally censured for his behavior. The investigation into von Ehlinger began in March after the young staffer reported he raped her after the two had dinner at a Boise restaurant. Von Ehlinger has denied all wrongdoing and maintains he had consensual sexual contact with the young woman. A legislative ethics committee unanimously found that he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and said it would support a vote to remove him from the Statehouse. The woman informed legislative leadership and the police about the rape allegations on her first day at work after the incident. She also testified before the legislative ethics committee, despite facing harassment from von Ehlinger’s supporters and some fellow lawmakers. Earlier this month attorney Erika Birch reportedly filed a tort claim with the state on the woman’s behalf, which is the first step in filing a lawsuit.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Two nuclear plants would be saved from closure and carbon-emitting coal plants closed during the next quarter-century as part of a clean-energy package the state Senate approved Monday, sending it to Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has pushed for a carbon-free Illinois by 2045. With just one vote over the minimum necessary, the 37-17 tally in the chamber controlled by Democrats came on the same day energy company Exelon had threatened to begin shutting down its nuclear-power generating station in Byron as unprofitable, with the Dresden generating site in Morris to follow this fall. But the Clean Energy Jobs Act provides a $700 million subsidy to Exelon with the idea of saving jobs and the large amount of carbon-free energy the plants already produce. “The state of Illinois is making history by setting aggressive standards for a 100% clean energy future,” Pritzker said in a post-vote statement. In addition to the nuclear-power subsidy, the legislation includes provisions for closing coal-burning plants in central and southwest Illinois, investing in renewable energy such as wind and solar, and offering $4,000 rebates on electric-vehicle purchases. Pritzker wants 1 million electric cars on Illinois roads by 2030. Plants producing greenhouse gases by burning coal must cut those emissions by 45% by 2035 and close permanently by 2045.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A Republican redistricting plan shores up a suburban Indianapolis district for the GOP while leaving a potentially targeted Democratic district in northwestern Indiana intact. The proposal for new congressional districts released Tuesday shifts the northern tier of Democratic-leaning Marion County from the district now held by Republican Rep. Victora Spartz to that of Indianapolis Democratic Rep. Andre Carson. That move will boost Spartz, who lost badly in Marion County in last year’s election even as she won by an overall 50%-46% margin over Democratic candidate Christina Hale. Other changes among Indiana’s nine congressional districts to account for population shifts don’t appear likely to shift the 7-2 control that Republicans now hold on those seats. The Republican plan leaves intact the northwestern Indiana district that includes industry-heavy Lake County and has long been a Democratic stronghold. The proposed district along Lake Michigan wouldn’t change much from the one Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan won last year. Republicans have full control Indiana’s redistricting process through their dominance of the state Legislature.\n\nIowa\n\nMount Ayr: A woman whose husband died from a breakthrough COVID-19 infection is blaming Americans who refuse to wear masks or get vaccinated. “It’s that kind of attitude that killed my husband,” said Ardith Keplinger, whose husband, Gary Keplinger, of Mount Ayr, was buried this month. In his obituary, the family wrote that his life was “unnecessarily cut short.” They described the retired school superintendent as “one of several victims recently infected from an unmasked, unvaccinated person.” His widow said he had a chronic autoimmune, neuromuscular condition called myasthenia gravis, which may have made him particularly susceptible when he attended a gathering of 50 to 75 extended family members in a rented hall in July. The couple had been avoiding crowds, but they mingled unmasked at the event, along with relatives, several of whom were unvaccinated, Ardith Keplinger said. “Within a week, 11 members of our family had COVID,” she said, adding that she was among them but recovered. But her husband and a cousin who also attended the party both died of the disease Aug. 11. The Iowa Department of Public Health reports vaccinated people make up just 10% of those being treated for the disease in the state’s intensive care units, even though 64% of Iowa adults have received the shots.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Hundreds of people chanted and held signs outside a University of Kansas fraternity house where a member is accused of sexually assaulting another student. The Kansas City Star reports the Monday night protest outside the Phi Kappa Psi house came after the fraternity officials reported the allegations over the weekend. “The university takes seriously all allegations of sexual violence and has robust processes to investigate such allegations,” university spokeswoman Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said in an email Tuesday. “We encourage anyone who has experienced sexual violence to contact law enforcement or the university’s Office of Civil Rights and Title IX to initiate an investigation.” The university has multiple resources to assist individuals who have experienced sexual violence, she said. A spokesman for the fraternity said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. “Phi Kappa Psi takes these allegations very seriously and will fully cooperate with law enforcement,” the statement said. “Due to the recent nature of these allegations and the need for a full and complete investigation, Phi Kappa Psi cannot provide further comments at this time.”\n\nKentucky\n\nBardstown: Union workers, upset over the prospect of expanded weekend shifts, have manned picket lines at bottling and warehouse operations of Heaven Hill Distillery, one of the world’s largest bourbon producers. The walkout involves about 420 members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23D. They voted overwhelmingly last week to reject a new five-year contract offer and formed picket lines Saturday at Heaven Hill’s operations in Bardstown. Family-owned and operated Heaven Hill produces Evan Williams, one of the world’s top-selling bourbons, and others including Elijah Craig, Henry McKenna, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny and Parker’s Heritage Collection. As the bourbon industry tries to keep up with increasing global demand, Heaven Hill signaled it wanted to assign new hires to nontraditional schedules that would include weekend work, Local 23D President Matt Aubrey said. The company was vague about how widespread weekend shifts would be and how it would affect existing workers, he said, raising a “red flag” with union workers. “They tell these workers, ‘You’re family, just like us. You’re our family,’ ” Aubrey said, adding that most workers have their own families. “If they get pushed on this nontraditional schedule, then that’s going to take them away from their loved ones.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSlidell: A 12-foot-long alligator believed to have attacked a man in Hurricane Ida floodwaters two weeks ago was captured and killed Monday, and authorities found human remains in its stomach. The St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office said the parish coroner’s office was working with investigators to determine if the remains were those of Timothy Satterlee, 71, who has been missing since the Aug. 30 attack. Ida had caused widespread flooding and knocked out electricity and phone service in parts of south Louisiana when it came ashore Aug. 29. Satterlee was attacked outside his home, which was surrounded by floodwaters, in the New Orleans suburb of Slidell on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Authorities said Satterlee’s wife heard a splash and walked outside their home to see the alligator attacking her husband. She managed to pull him, severely injured in the attack, to the steps of their home and used a small boat to reach higher ground to get help. But when she and deputies returned to the house, Satterlee was gone. Sheriff’s deputies were joined by federal and state wildlife agents in the search for the alligator. A trap set by alligator hunters captured the 500-pound animal Monday morning.\n\nMaine\n\nPresque Isle: Potato growers anticipate a solid crop and stronger demand thanks to reopening restaurants, providing a sense of optimism heading into the harvest in northern Maine. Another positive indicator: A decline in acreage was reversed with an extra 8,000 acres planted this summer. “Growing conditions have been really good. We have a quality crop, and we expect good yields. Market demand is good,” said Don Flannery, executive director of the Maine Potato Board. Growers are looking for something to cheer after a dismal 2020 in which some farmers gave away potatoes to avoid having them go to waste, and crops withered from heat and drought in northern Maine. This summer, rainfall was nearly 3 inches below average, but that’s better than last summer, which ranked as the warmest and second-driest since records were kept in Caribou, according to the National Weather Service. Temperatures hitting 90 and above can stunt the growth of potatoes, but the highest temperature this summer was 84 degrees, Flannery said. Potatoes are big business in Maine, with direct sales in the neighborhood of $300 million supporting about 2,400 jobs. About 65% of Maine’s potatoes are processed into french fries, chips or some other product, and demand for processed potatoes is rebounding.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A panel of state lawmakers approved an emergency measure Tuesday to require masks in K-12 schools to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The 10-7 vote by the General Assembly’s Joint Committee on Administrative, Executive and Legislative Review puts the emergency regulation into effect for up to 180 days. The Maryland State Board of Education approved the regulation last month on an 11-1 vote. Only two of Maryland’s 24 jurisdictions, Carroll and Somerset counties, had not already required students to wear masks while attending school. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended universal mask-wearing for teachers and students inside school buildings this fall, citing the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. Maryland State Superintendent of Schools Mohammed Choudhury said the mask requirement will increase safety and help reduce the need for quarantining sick students. “Seventeen other states, including most of Maryland’s neighbors, have required that all individuals wear masks in school buildings,” Choudhury said. He said data will be reviewed each month, and the board of education will consider whether the requirement could be lifted, if conditions improve enough, in consultation with the state health department.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Harvard University will divest itself from holdings in fossil fuels, President Lawrence Bacow said Thursday. Harvard Management Company, which oversees the university’s nearly $42 billion endowment, has already been reducing its exposure to fossil fuels and has no direct investments in companies that explore for or develop further reserves of fossil fuels, Bacow said in a message posted on the university’s website. The university has legacy investments in a number of private equity funds with holdings in the fossil fuel industry. Those indirect investments constitute less than 2% of the endowment, according to Bacow. The school has not made any new commitments to these limited partnerships since 2019 and has no intention to do so going forward, he said. Bacow said the legacy investments are in “runoff mode” and will end as these partnerships are liquidated. Harvard has already committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire investment portfolio by 2050, he said. The decision follows years of protests from students who have pressed Harvard to divest from fossil fuel companies. Harvard is building a portfolio of investments in funds that support the transition to a green economy, Bacow wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Former Detroit Police Chief James Craig formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday – but not before protesters derailed his kickoff event on Belle Isle and forced him to move. Craig effectively has been running for months. He is among 10 Republicans, all of them political newcomers, looking to unseat Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022. Craig was to speak to the media at the state park in the middle of the Detroit River in his hometown, but he abandoned that plan when he was shouted down by a couple dozen people critical of his role as chief. He turned around and walked back toward a waiting vehicle, which took him to a nearby office complex, where he made the announcement a short time later. “My name is James Craig. And I’m running to be your governor,” he said, flashing a thumbs-up. “The governor for the state of Michigan.” He nodded as supporters chanted: “Chief Craig.” As for the disruption on Belle Isle, Craig said a “small group of paid protesters did nothing. What they did is reinforce why we need change.” Asked about his statement that the protesters were paid, Craig said he did not have evidence of that but believed it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Four former police officers charged with violating George Floyd’s civil rights pleaded not guilty Tuesday in a federal hearing that included arguments on several pretrial motions, including requests to hold separate trials. A federal grand jury indicted Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao in May for allegedly depriving Floyd of his rights while acting under government authority May 25, 2020, as Floyd, 46, was held face-down, handcuffed and not resisting in a restraint that was captured on bystander video. His death led to worldwide protests and calls for change in policing. All four of the men appeared at the hearing remotely via videoconference. Chauvin, wearing a plain T-shirt, appeared from a small room in the state’s maximum-security prison, where he is serving a 22 1/ 2 -year sentence for murder in Floyd’s death. The other three men appeared remotely alongside their attorneys. U.S. Magistrate Judge Tony Leung asked each man separately how he would plea, and each clearly responded: “Not guilty.” The hearing also addressed roughly 40 pretrial motions. Most of the motions were routine, such as agreeing when names of witnesses would be disclosed. But Leung heard oral arguments on two issues and ordered attorneys to file additional written arguments on those motions.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: A third person has died as a result of a highway collapse two weeks ago. Amanda Williams of Wiggins died Saturday after being hospitalized since the Aug. 30 collapse, WLOX-TV reports. The collapse on Highway 26 outside Lucedale in George County, which occurred during torrential rain brought by Hurricane Ida, caused seven vehicles to crash into the washed-out roadway. Two people died at the time of the crash, and 10 others were injured, including 39-year-old Wiggins and her 16-year-old daughter, Emily. Emily Williams is currently recovering from a torn colon, a broken leg and other injuries. Amanda Williams was being treated for her injuries at Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg when she died, according to WLOX. During a Sept. 5 video interview with WLOX-TV, Emily Williams said she could hear the terrifying sounds of other vehicles crashing around – and on top of – the pickup truck where she and her mother were trapped after the truck plunged into a dark, muddy pit when the highway collapsed. “I saw a black hole, then I blacked out, and I woke up, and my mom was leaned over toward me. She was choking on her blood, and she couldn’t breathe or anything,” she told the television station.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: A cave containing Native American artwork from more than 1,000 years ago was sold at auction Tuesday, disappointing leaders of the Osage Nation who hoped to buy the land to “protect and preserve our most sacred site.” A bidder agreed to pay $2.2 million to private owners for what’s known as “Picture Cave,” along with the 43 hilly acres that surround it near the town of Warrenton, about 60 miles west of St. Louis. Bryan Laughlin, director of Selkirk Auctioneers & Appraisers, the St. Louis-based firm handling the auction, said the winning bidder declined to be named. A St. Louis family that’s owned the land since 1953 has mainly used it for hunting. The cave was the site of sacred rituals and burying of the dead. It also has more than 290 prehistoric glyphs, “making it the largest collection of indigenous people’s polychrome paintings in Missouri,” according to the auction website. The Osage Nation, in a statement, called the sale “truly heartbreaking.” “Our ancestors lived in this area for 1300 years,” the statement said. “This was our land. We have hundreds of thousands of our ancestors buried throughout Missouri and Illinois, including Picture Cave.” The cave features drawings of people, animals, birds and mythical creatures.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a plan for road building, logging and other forest management measures in the Swan Valley with the goal of reducing fire danger and enhancing habitat for several federally protected species, the agency said. The project area is located on U.S. Forest Service lands on both sides of Montana Highway 83 between the communities of Condon and Swan Lake. “Species such as Canada lynx, bull trout and whitebark pine face unprecedented risk from climate change, exotic pathogens and all the associated ecological impacts, and failure to act will most likely result in their continued decline,” Flathead National Forest Supervisor Kurt Steele wrote in a draft record of a decision published Friday. “A warming and drier climate, combined with the legacy effects of fire suppression, requires active vegetation management, and the scientific knowledge applied to this decision has been shown to be an effective prescription to mitigate these risks.” The agency plans to approve about half of its initially proposed 15-year project. Doing so will reduce plans for logging, road building and improvement, and the number of acres where trees are to be thinned or burned with fires called prescribed burns set in certain areas to reduce wildfire risks, the Daily Inter Lake reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers launched a special session Monday to redraw the state’s political boundaries, with one proposal that would add a 50th state senator to the Legislature to try to keep rural Nebraska from losing a seat. Sen. Mark Kolterman, of Seward, proposed the measure along with two other rural senators. The bill would expand the Legislature from its current 49 members to 50, as allowed under the Nebraska Constitution. Adding a senator would reduce the ideal number of residents per legislative district, making it easier for lawmakers to preserve rural districts that lost population over the past decade while still adding a district to fast-growing suburban Omaha. The bill’s prospects are unclear, and some lawmakers questioned whether they could legally consider it in a special session that’s strictly limited to redistricting issues. Lawmakers have asked the state’s attorney general to offer a legal opinion. Even so, rural senators said they planned to press the issue as a way to ease pressure on senators by reducing the average number of residents per district. The measure was co-sponsored by Sens. Matt Williams, of Gothenburg, and John Stinner, of Gering. “I want to help protect the rural senators of the state,” said Kolterman, whose district could be merged with another rural area under one of the proposed plans.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A national advocacy group has filed a sweeping federal lawsuit aimed at convincing a judge the nation’s only legal brothels are dens of illegal sex trafficking and unconstitutional slavery. The case filed Friday in Las Vegas by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation names the governor, state attorney general, and city and county officials as defendants, along with a brothel in Nye County and hip-hop music figure Jamal “Mally Mall” Rashid. Rashid, 46, is serving a 33-month federal prison term after pleading guilty to operating a prostitution business disguised as a Las Vegas escort enterprise. Attorneys who represented him in that case did not immediately respond to a message about the lawsuit. Representatives of Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak, state Attorney General Aaron Ford, Las Vegas and Clark County declined to comment. Officials in Nye County and the Chicken Ranch brothel in Pahrump did not immediately respond to messages. The lawsuit seeks to abolish Nevada’s legal prostitution statutes as unconstitutional and a violation of federal anti-trafficking laws. It asks the court to order reimbursement to victims of “all profits and unjust enrichment obtained as a result.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A man has been accused of putting his baby daughter into a clothes dryer and turning on the machine before the mother quickly stopped it, police said. Police arrested the man in Manchester on Sunday on charges of reckless conduct, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal threatening. The child did not appear to be injured. The man waived arraignment Monday, and a judge ordered him held without bail. His case has been assigned to a public defender’s office, but no attorney was listed for him in court documents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: The Sea Hear Now music festival returns to town this upcoming weekend after the 2020 event was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. And this year’s fest will have some musicians showing off their other artistic talents, too. Patti Smith, Eddie Vedder and other members of Pearl Jam, Scott Avett of the Avett Brothers, and more will show their artwork inside the Transparent Gallery pop-up Saturday and Sunday in Bradley Park. In past festivals, musicians have popped into the gallery for an impromptu performance. Musically, the fest – held on the beach and in Bradley Park – will also feature acts including Billy Idol, Lord Huron, Dr. Dog, Grouplove, Orville Peck, Ani DiFranco, and Tank and the Bangas. More than 35,000 people attended the second Sea Hear Now in 2019 to see groups such as the Dave Matthews Band and the Lumineers. Organizers expect about 35,000 this year, but there will be more room on the beach, as the two stages will be farther apart by about a city block. Construction on the festival grounds started over the weekend. Attendees will need to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative coronavirus test.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Election officials are deploying ballot drop boxes across the state for people who choose to cast absentee ballots without walking indoors during the upcoming Nov. 2 local elections for public offices including the mayors of Albuquerque and Santa Fe. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told a legislative panel Monday that county clerks are required to provide one drop box for every 25,000 voters and at least two per county. Exceptions can be made at the request of local county officials. The quick-drop boxes for voting are among a long list measures backed by Toulouse Oliver, a second-term Democrat, that are aimed at making voting more accessible. Lawmakers appropriated funding for the initiative amid concerns about COVID-19 and indoor crowding at polling places. Ballots must be collected at least once a day from the boxes, video surveillance of drop boxes is required, and recordings must be retained by county clerks. It remains illegal for any person to deliver a ballot for another person with the exception of immediate family, and signs at each drop box are required to explain that prohibition against so-called ballot harvesting.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Parents of adults with severe autism and other disabilities say state officials are threatening to revoke funding for their children’s long-term care at out-of-state care centers unless they agree to send their children to a secure, in-state facility. Some parents believe they have no alternative but to send their adult children to the Sunmount Developmental Center in Franklin County in the Adirondacks, the Times Union of Albany reports. They describe the facility as remote and prison-like. A group of state lawmakers recently asked Gov. Kathy Hochul to end the policy, which they say was put in place by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in an apparent cost-saving move. The lawmakers, including Democratic Assemblyman Andrew Hevesi of New York City, say the policy may violate disabled people’s right to receive care in the least restrictive setting, which was guaranteed under a 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. A 2014 state law also guaranteed due-process rights for disabled children and their families in long-term care decisions, when the child turns 21 or graduates from school. In a response Friday, the state Office for People with Developmental Disabilities said a legal process prevents the agency from providing funding for out-of-state care at a certain point.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: A fund set up to honor George Floyd and raise awareness about racial injustice said Monday that it has awarded more than $50,000 in scholarships since it was created. The Fayetteville-based George Floyd Memorial Foundation said it has recently given scholarships valued at $1,000 to 15 law school students, scholarships valued at $10,000 to interns, and $2,500 scholarships to undergraduate students. The foundation said it has also awarded $25,000 to Fayetteville State University, a historically Black college. Foundation executive director Jacari Harris said the scholarships keep Floyd’s memory alive and support students. “Our hope at the George Floyd Memorial Foundation is that these high-achieving students will become attorneys, activists and scholars who will work to ensure people are treated fairly around the world,” Harris said in a statement. Bridgett Floyd, George Floyd’s sister and the foundation’s founder, said that “as the days, months and years go by, one thing is true: My brother George’s death truly changed the world, and by offering support to these students, it will allow us to continue to bring hope to those in need.” The foundation, created in August 2020, focuses on raising awareness of racial injustices, police brutality and ensuring everyone’s civil rights are protected.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A three-day symposium to discuss the history and revitalization of the American bison has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, event organizers said Monday. The Dakota Bison Symposium had been scheduled for Thursday through Saturday. Many of the national speakers have recently decided against traveling to North Dakota, where 1 in every 253 people tested positive for the coronavirus in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. It is also one of the worst states in the country for rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. Bismarck State College and its partners decided against a virtual format and rescheduled the event for next spring, BSC President Doug Jensen told The Bismarck Tribune. “One of the exciting things about symposia is getting to rub elbows with these national speakers,” Jensen said. “Within the last few weeks, we’ve lost that aspect of the conference.” The symposium also was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The North Dakota Department of Health on Monday confirmed 180 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,815 active cases throughout the state. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by nearly 48%.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republicans and Democrats appeared closer to agreement Monday on a map of state legislative districts that could stand for the next 10 years, as a powerful new redistricting panel faced a looming Wednesday deadline. But a group that monitors redistricting and works to reduce the drawing of political district lines that maximize partisan advantage, a process called gerrymandering, flunked the Ohio GOP’s proposed state House map in an analysis released earlier Monday. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project, working with the anti-corruption group RepresentUS, said its boundaries fell short of being fair when compared to a million simulated alternatives, delivering it a score of “F.” The analysis gave a better score of “B” to the Ohio Senate map that Republicans have proposed, which Democratic consultant Chris Glassburn also reworked and presented Monday. Analysts said the second map fared better because each Senate district contains three House districts, diluting the partisan advantage. During a regional hearing in suburban Cleveland, members of the Ohio Redistricting Commission’s GOP majority – including state Auditor Keith Faber, Secretary of State Frank LaRose and Senate President Matt Huffman praised Glassburn, for his work on a revised map aimed at garnering the support of both parties.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials said Tuesday that coronavirus hospitalizations appear to be leveling off, but hospital stays are longer due to the delta variant of the virus. The three-day average of new COVID-19 hospitalizations fell from 1,518 a week ago to 1,352 on Tuesday, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Health, which reported a seven-day average of 2,114 new cases daily, down from 2,709 one week ago. However, the average hospitalization increased from five to six days in January to 10-11 days currently, and intensive acre unit stays rose from 10-11 days to 15-20, said Dr. David Kendrick, chair of Medical Informatics at the University of Oklahoma School of Community Medicine. Patti Davis, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said it is too soon to call the decline a trend. “Given … Labor Day activities, all health care providers probably have their fingers crossed and are hoping for the best, but not assuming (the decline) will hold once we get at the requisite date past Labor Day,” which could result in another surge in cases, Davis said. Kendrick said most new virus cases are among younger patients; 21.6% are 36-49 years old, and those ages 18-35 account for about 18% of new cases.\n\nOregon\n\nTroutdale: An explosion in a pickup truck killed a man early Monday, authorities said. Police and firefighters responded to calls at 2:19 a.m. reporting a loud explosion and vehicle fire at a home , the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office said. The Gresham Fire Department extinguished the fire, and the sheriff’s office said a person was located inside the burned vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The body was taken to the county Medical Examiner’s Office. The case and manner of death are yet to be determined. Investigators are not yet releasing the identity of the man, the sheriff’s office said. Special agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Seattle branch are assisting the Multnomah County Sheriff’s Office and other agencies in the investigation. Investigators are trying to determine what caused the explosion, which is believed to have originated inside the vehicle, according to the sheriff’s office. No other injuries were reported, and the sheriff’s office said there was no threat of additional explosions. “We woke up with a big explosion, and things were falling in the house, so I thought the house was falling down,” neighbor JoAnn Robinson told KGW-TV. The siding on Robinson’s home is covered in holes from debris.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: More than $104 million in Pennsylvania Turnpike tolls went uncollected last year as the agency fully converted to all-electronic tolling, with the millions of motorists who don’t use E-ZPass having a nearly 1 in 2 chance of riding without paying under the “toll-by-plate” license plate camera system. An internal turnpike report issued in July and obtained by the Associated Press through a Right-to-Know Law request showed nearly 11 million out of the total of about 170 million turnpike rides generated no revenue for the agency in the year that ended May 31. “We take this issue very seriously. It is a big number, there’s no question,” turnpike Chief Executive Mark Compton said. “But we, as an organization, are leaving no stone unturned in the way in which we’re going after that leakage.” Toll revenue “leakage” – an industry euphemism for uncollected tolls – has become the focus of turnpike agencies across the country as the use of E-ZPass transponders and license plate cameras continues to spread. It is a particular problem for the debt-strapped Pennsylvania Turnpike, more than half of whose total revenue goes to pay borrowing costs and tolls have more than quadrupled in 12 years for the minority of motorists who don’t have E-Z Pass to pay for rides.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Brown University has paused in-person dining and instituted a limit of five people for undergraduate social gatherings in response to a recent rise in confirmed COVID-19 cases on campus. The Ivy League school had 82 confirmed coronavirus cases, primarily among undergraduate students, in the prior seven days, according to a statement Monday. “The increase in positive asymptomatic test results is a reflection of the transmissibility of the delta variant, our significant increase in the number of tests conducted at Brown, and an increase in our student population, some of whom have been engaging with other students in multiple smaller groups outside the classroom, especially indoors without masks,” the school’s statement said. Those testing positive generally remain asymptomatic, and there are no indications of serious illness and no hospitalizations, the school said. There is no evidence of spread in classrooms, and classes will continue, the school said. The “short-term” restrictions also include increased undergraduate student testing from once to twice per week and an indoor mask requirement. Brown requires vaccinations for students and employees.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenwood: Residents of an Upstate neighborhood say they were ducking for cover after pellets from a nearby dove hunt started striking them. Children playing outside were also struck by the pellets, one of them as he played on a trampoline, WYFF-TV reports. The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources responded to calls Saturday afternoon about the stray pellets coming from a field in Greenwood County. Neighbors said they saw 10 to 20 people in the field hunting doves. Department of Natural resources officials said they talked to several people who say they were hit, including a 6-year-old boy who had two marks on his cheek. The land is private property, and the landowner wasn’t doing anything illegal, authorities said. There is no state law or regulation mandating the minimum distance from other homes or properties from a dove hunt on private land. Officials said they talked to the landowner, who voluntarily stopped the hunt due to safety and noise concerns. Neighbors said the children struck by pellets were OK.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: State lawmakers on Monday rejected a handful of proposals for rules governing medical marijuana from Gov. Kristi Noem’s administration but approved the bulk of the program. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee, which is responsible for approving administration rules, effectively told the Department of Health to try again on a number of controversial rule proposals. Most of the Department of Health’s 124-page proposal got the sign-off from the Legislature, spelling out rules ranging from fees for cardholders to the heights of fences around cannabis growing facilities. The rules they rejected included proposals that would have limited the amount of high-potency marijuana that patients could possess, required medical practitioners to write a recommendation for patients who wanted to grow more than three cannabis plants, and defined a list of conditions that would qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. The law allowing medical marijuana, passed by 70% of voters last year, has seen a halting acceptance from officials trying to balance a clear mandate from voters while placing restrictions on medical marijuana. The rules set a $75 application fee for medical marijuana cards and discount the fee to $20 for low-income applicants.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Rhodes College is investigating after students reported racist and anti-Semitic incidents on campus a few weeks into the fall semester. In one instance, a banana was taped to the door of a dorm room of two Black students, student organization Men of Distinction has said. The group called for more swift and public response by the college. Interim President Carroll D. Stevens wrote to campus last Friday: “Whatever the intentions when actions or words make members of our community feel unsafe or unwelcome, they do not align with our values as a college community.” The president’s letter did not specify particular incidents on campus but said the incidents made Black and Jewish students in particular feel unsafe. Kofi Whitehead, student president of Men of Distinction, immediately called leaders of the organization together. He knew the students targeted by the Labor Day incident, he said, but it could have been “any of us.” In a post days after it happened, Men of Distinction decried the lack of response from the Rhodes administration. In an interview Monday, Whitehead said he acknowledged that internally, campus leadership was likely working to address the issue. But when a racist incident occurs in a public place, and students see it across social media, he expects the college to be more upfront.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Travis County commissioners voted unanimously Tuesday to allocate $110million in federal funds to build housing units for people experiencing homelessness in the area. The vote was met by applause from the group of homelessness service providers and community leaders gathered in the commissioners’ court chambers. The vote marks a significant investment in housing projects from the county – a change from the commissioners’ initial reluctance to spend money directly on housing units. Commissioner Margaret Gomez, who developed and sponsored the plan with Commissioner Ann Howard and a diverse coalition of local community leaders and organizations, said after years of discussion on the need to address affordable housing issues and homelessness in the Austin area, it was time for something different. “I think it’s time we take some action here,” Gomez said. The $110 million comes from the federal American Rescue Plan Act, which was the second of two federal stimulus programs created during the coronavirus pandemic. Travis County received $247 million from the program and had wide discretion on how to spend it. The funding will go toward the construction of 10 or so projects that would total more than 2,000 new housing units.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man who displayed a rifle at a youth soccer tournament, spreading panic through the crowd, wasn’t prompted by anything related to the game, police said Monday. People screamed “active shooter” as parents and players ran to take cover behind cars in the parking lot after the man retrieved the gun from his car Saturday afternoon, the Deseret News reports. Ultimately no shots were fired, but it was terrifying for many who were there. “It was pretty traumatizing,” said parent Megan Perkins. “My kid is pretty shaken.” The man had been involved in an argument at the game when he went back to his car and retrieved the weapon, Salt Lake City Police said. No one has been arrested, but those involved have been identified by investigators. Police did not release their names or say what the argument was about but said it did not appear to be related to the game or the tournament, according to a statement Monday. U.S. Youth Soccer officials said they were saddened by the traumatic experience but proud of staff and volunteers who helped defuse the situation. The team associated with the people involved was expelled from the tournament, the organization said. Additional sanctions are possible.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The state on Tuesday became the latest to sue some of the country’s top fossil fuel companies by alleging they misled the public about the impact their products have on climate change. The state wants the companies to tell consumers that the use of fossil fuel products harms the environment, Vermont Attorney General T.J. Donovan said after the lawsuit was filed in Vermont Superior Court in Burlington. The warnings could be similar to those noting the danger of tobacco products or food products that include nutritional and calorie information, he said. Donovan, speaking outside the Chittenden County courthouse in downtown Burlington where the lawsuit was filed, said officials are not trying to prevent the companies from selling their products in the state, and residents will continue to be able to use fossil fuels. “What we are saying is that Vermonters have the right to know,” Donovan said. “Give Vermonters accurate information. Put a label on the product, and let Vermonters decide.” The suit names ExxonMobil Corp., Shell Oil Co., Sunoco LP, CITGO Petroleum Corp. and other corporations. In a Tuesday email, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil said the suit was baseless and without merit. Citgo declined to comment on pending litigation. The other two companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Five people who recently traveled to the state from Afghanistan have been diagnosed with measles, health officials said Tuesday. The cases are being reported four days after the U.S. halted inbound flights of Afghan evacuees following the discovery of a few cases of measles among new arrivals. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release that the people were part of the U.S. government’s emergency evacuation efforts from Afghanistan, which recently came under Taliban rule. State health officials did not offer specifics Tuesday regarding where the people who are infected are located. But they said they’re working to identify and contact people who may have been exposed in three parts of the state. Those places include Dulles International Airport, where some refugees flew into the U.S., and other parts of northern Virginia. Health officials are also working to notify people potentially exposed at an unidentified Richmond hospital and at Fort Pickett, an Army National Guard base southwest of Richmond that is providing temporary housing to recently arrived evacuees. Measles is a highly contagious disease that can be spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat. Most Americans are vaccinated against it as children.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted to move some of the $15 million in savings related to police officer departures to community-based programs. The police department will keep about $10 illion for technology projects and other expenses, while about $5 million will be invested elsewhere in what Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda described as a “hybrid approach.” The plan will partially address commitments the council made in 2020 to decrease the police department’s budget during 2021, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-1, with Councilmember Kshama Sawant calling for the department to keep less money. The council’s midyear budget legislation somewhat jibes with a plan proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan over the summer, though a Durkan-backed request that some money be allocated for officer hiring and retention incentives was rejected. In November, Durkan and the council decreased the police department’s budget by tens of millions of dollars for 2021, reversing a growth trend. But they also cleared the department to hire new officers. The council is also no longer pursuing layoffs of officers with records of misconduct, citing legal barriers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The numbers of new cases and people hospitalized for the coronavirus in the state both smashed records yet again Monday as Gov. Jim Justice scolded residents who continue to balk at receiving COVID-19 vaccines. At least 40% of the state’s population above age 12 has not been fully inoculated, according to health data. Efforts by Justice and others to urge residents to do so have resulted in only minimal improvement in recent weeks. “This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Justice said at a news conference. The Republican governor has himself balked at issuing either a vaccination mandate or new mask requirements. An earlier indoor masking rule was lifted in June as the number of cases dropped. At the news conference, Justice introduced Linda Lanier, who said her adult son, Joe Goodnite, refused to get vaccinated and contracted COVID-19 on a family vacation. He’s been in a Charleston hospital for more than six weeks and remains on a ventilator. Lanier’s son “listened to all the negative and false accusations about vaccination,” she said. “Being in the medical field myself, I tried to convince him. However, it didn’t work. He listened to his friends. He listened to social media. And he just listened to what I call the garbage that’s out there.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge’s decision to release from a mental health facility a woman who helped stab her sixth grade classmate to please online horror character Slender Man has left the victim’s family nervous and afraid, a spokesman said Tuesday. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren on Friday ordered 19-year-old Anissa Weier released from the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh, ruling that she’s no longer a threat and that conditions on her release should protect both her and the community. Weier has spent nearly four years at the facility. Bohren had scheduled her release for Monday. Officials with the state Department of Health Services, which oversees Winnebago, have repeatedly refused to so much as acknowledge Weier was a patient out of privacy concerns. Steve Lyons, a spokesman for victim Payton Leutner’s family, said Tuesday that they’re disappointed with Bohren’s decision and that Weier should have served more time. “We’re just nervous that she’s going to be out,” Lyons said. “We’re nervous about the potential of what could happen.” Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Leutner suffered 19 wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The leader of the state Senate expects Gov. Mark Gordon to call a special legislation session on vaccine mandates, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Senate President Dan Dockstader, R-Afton, said the effort to repel President Joe Biden’s controversial executive order last week – which says large companies must require workers either to get a COVID-19 vaccination or to undergo regular coronavirus testing – seemed likely to result in a special session, though the Republican governor would have to request the move. But it’s unlikely legislators could block a presidential order, according to the paper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/15"}]}

So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails. Ukrainian males ages 18 to 60 are banned from leaving the country.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Molotov cocktails and personal arms. See how Ukrainians are fighting back 02:26 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a statement Sunday, Zelensky called on citizens of the world also to join the fight against the “Russian war criminals.”\n\n“This is not just Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration.

The legislation requires that databases and other internet platforms take down certain private information related to a federal judge or their family – such as home addresses, sensitive financial information, or employment information of their spouse – if the judge requests the information’s removal.\n\nAfter a multi-year effort to get the legislation passed in Congress, the bill was tucked into a major, must-pass defense package that the House approved last week and that will be taken up by the Senate in the coming days.\n\nHere’s what to know about the judicial security bill:\n\nWhat does the legislation do?\n\nThe bill allows the federal judiciary’s administrative office to file lawsuits – which carry the threat of fines and other penalties – against internet sites or other entities that don’t comply with demands from judges that certain personal information be taken down. Among the categories of personal information that can be restricted from public view under the bill are judges’ full birthdays; home addresses, including second homes; sensitive financial information like bank accounts and credit card information; and information related to their spouses’ employment. Under the bill, relatives of the judge, like their spouses, children or even anyone living at their home, can also make the removal demands.\n\nThe categories of information covered by the bill were crafted based on the feedback lawmakers got about the threats the judges are facing, according to a Democratic congressional aide, who pointed particularly to how certain information could be used to physically track judges.\n\nThe bill does not displace the ethical disclosure requirements judges already face, the congressional aide noted to CNN.\n\nWhen a version of the legislation was introduced last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) raised concerns that the legislation, if applied broadly, could unconstitutionally restrict speech. But the civil liberties organization is not opposing the bill.\n\nLawmakers worked with the ACLU and court watchdog groups to adjust the legislation’s language, according to Hill staff. The current version says that media outlets and others that publish covered information are exempted from the removal demands if the information is “relevant to and displayed as part of a news story, commentary, editorial or other speech on a matter of public concern.”\n\nAdditionally, the bill requires that judges be offered training on how to make removal requests, as well as training on home security and on using social media. It provides a grant program for state and local governments to facilitate their compliance with information removal requests. And it extends the threat-monitoring programs that are being offered to Article III judges to administrative judges as well.\n\nWhat prompted the bill?\n\nThe bill was introduced by Sens. Bob Menendez and Cory Booker, and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, all New Jersey Democrats, in the weeks after the July 2020 attack on the US District Judge Esther Salas’ family, which killed her son and left her husband seriously injured. They were shot at her home in the summer of 2020 by a gun man impersonating a delivery man. The apparent gunman, who later took his own life, was a men’s rights attorney who argued a case in front of Judge Salas, and who had written racist and sexist rants about her. He had found personal information about the judge on the internet.\n\n“The federal judiciary is critical to our democracy and this bill is designed to protect judges as they perform their solemn duty of administering equal justice under the law,” Menendez said in a statement to CNN.\n\nThe attack on Salas’ family was one of several examples of judges being targeted with violence. Earlier this year, a man attempted to break into the home of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in an alleged assassination plot and a former state court judge in Wisconsin was killed in his home in June. Other judges and their families have been targeted with violence and hostile behavior in recent years.\n\nAccording to statistics by the US Marshals Service, the number of threats and inappropriate communications to judges reported to the agency have risen dramatically in recent years. The reports more than quadrupled between 2015 and 2018 – from 926 to 4,542 in those years, respectively – and have remained at around the 2018 level in the years since.\n\nThe bill has the emphatic support of federal judicial organizations and of several bar associations.\n\nThey praised the bill as “striking a balance between the need for judicial security with First Amendment concerns and the public’s interest in transparency” in a letter this fall to congressional leaders that said it was “imperative that Congress enact these provisions without delay.”\n\nSalas has taken a notably public role in advocating for more protections for judges, making appearances on Capitol Hill and in news media.\n\n“We’re in a unique position. We preside over cases and 50% of the time people are not happy with us,” Salas told CNN after the former Wisconsin judge, John Roemer, was killed. “If the death of my 20-year-old son and now of Judge Roemer doesn’t say we need something done to protect this personally identifiable information, I don’t know what will.”\n\nWhy is the legislation being passed with a defense bill?\n\nThe legislation has attracted broad bipartisan support, attracting GOP sponsors like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and passing out of the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously last year. But the efforts to get it approved by the full Senate have been thwarted by Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who has objected to attempts to pass it via a floor mechanism known as unanimous consent.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Paul said that he agrees with the “spirit” of the bill but wanted its privacy protections extended to members of Congress. Now that the bill has been added to the National Defense Authorization Act, a massive defense package that Congress passes annually, Paul’s options for scuttling it are limited.\n\nHow will the bill affect efforts to scrutinize judges for ethical conflicts and other concerns?\n\nThe legislation’s intentions of protecting judges from bad actors are widely supported. But critics say its means of doing may have a chilling effect on those who scrutinize conflicts of interests and other ethical concerns on the federal bench. It may also impede the reporting on those issues, the skeptics contend.\n\nThe concerns are two-fold: that the bill will create legal exposure for those who publish private information about a judge for a legitimate reason. And that it will make gathering the information that makes that scrutiny possible more difficult, by potentially restricting public access to things like real estate records and information about where a spouse works.\n\nWhether these worries will bear out will depend largely on how the legislation is enforced, according to legal experts and the legislation’s critics.\n\nCongressional staff worked with constitutional law experts, including the ACLU, to structure the legislation’s exemptions. But critics still see the carve-out language as being open-ended enough to make some – and especially good government activists and other court watchers who don’t fit squarely in the exemption language geared at media outlets – leery about publishing information that might expose them under the law.\n\n“I am happy there’s a media exemption in it … but it should be clearer to ensure that the work I do and the work that others do in the accountability space is protected,” said Gabe Roth, whose group Fix the Court advocates for more transparency and ethical standards in the judiciary. “Because, if I am sued, someone is going to be bringing it to a federal judge. It’s not like a neutral arbiter says, ‘Oh ya, it’s a matter of public concern.’”\n\nThe bill gives recipients of takedown requests from judges 72 hours to comply, a notice period that will allow publishers the ability to object to requests they think fall within the legislation’s exemptions, according to the congressional aide.\n\nOf second concern is how it will make it more difficult to report on judges in the first place, by obscuring some of the sources of information court observers and journalists use to examine potential ethical conflicts within the judiciary.\n\nRecords linked to a judge’s home address may lead to reporting showing that he or she has benefited from a shady real estate deal from a political donor. Or a spouse’s employment information may raise questions about whether the judge is following their recusal obligations – a topic that has been at the center of public debate with the reporting on Justice Clarence Thomas’ wife’s political advocacy.\n\n“It’s not hard to see why that provision rings alarm bells in a climate where there has been quite a lot of important reporting about the political activities of the spouses of sitting members of the judiciary,” said Grayson Clary, a staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\n\nWill the bill stand up in court?\n\nThe bill’s supporters acknowledge that its approach is novel, but are confident they have hit the right balance between protecting judges and complying with the Constitution. That may be tested in a legal challenge, if those who are subjected to enforcement are willing to fight back in court.\n\nThe databrokers who are subjected to specific restrictions under the bill regarding the transmission of judges’ private information “might not step up for the free flow of information,” Clary said.\n\nThe constitutionality of the legislation may depend on how aggressively the bill is enforced, particularly when it comes to that the way the carveout language – and its protections for information that is published because it is relevant to matters of public concern – is interpreted.\n\n“If the [exemption] language is read broadly, then it would protect all the speech that needs protection,” said Eugene Volokh, a constitutional law professor at the UCLA School of Law. “If the language is read narrowly, then it could end up suppressing a good deal of constitutionally-protected speech.”", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/17/trump-waterford-rally/72583713007/", "title": "Trump in Waterford blasts judge, recognizes Michigan's importance", "text": "Former President Donald Trump delivered a combative campaign speech Saturday night at an Oakland County airport hangar, beginning by chiding a judge who fined him some $450 million for financial fraud a day before and blasting his critics and a judicial system he claimed is corrupt and set up against him for political reasons.\n\n\"It's a horrible, horrible thing that is taking place,\" Trump said as his speech got underway shortly after 7 p.m. \"You're talking about democracy. This is a terrible threat to democracy taking place.\"\n\nIn a speech that lasted more than an hour and saw Trump bring an autoworker on stage with him, the former president listed a series of grievances against President Joe Biden and the current administration, blaming him for open borders and crime — even though violent crime was down across the U.S. last year — and saying only he can secure the borders, enforce trade deals and stop a move to force automakers to sell more electric vehicles.\n\nDelivering the speech 10 days before Michigan's Feb. 27 Republican primary, Trump was under no illusions about how significant the state will be if, as expected, he wins the nomination to face Biden in the fall, saying, \"If we win Michigan, we win the election.\"\n\nHe could well be right.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat, Trump began the speech by launching into a sweeping defense of his business practices and his contention that Democrats are out to get him and keep him from being elected president again. \"These are Democrats that definitely hate me — they hate you, too,\" he said to a crowd of about 2,000 supporters gathered in a hangar in Waterford northwest of Detroit.\n\nTrump's visit to a state he won in 2016 before losing decisively to Biden in 2020 comes at a legally fraught time for the former president. A day earlier, New York Justice Arthur Engoron hit Trump with a fine that tops $450 million with interest and barred him from doing business in the state for three years for illegally inflating financial reports. Earlier in the week, another New York judge ruled that a criminal trial of Trump — related to hush money payments paid to an adult film actress ahead of his 2016 election — can move forward in March.\n\nTrump is expected to appeal the Friday finding though he will likely have to put up a sizable financial bond to do so but his financial exposure has become vast, especially since just three weeks ago he was fined a $83.3 million judgment in a civil defamation case stemming from his public denial of writer E. Jean Carroll's sexual assault allegations against him after a civil jury had found in her favor.\n\nHe has continued to denounce those cases as well as others, including one in Georgia related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, another involving the same issue before a federal judge in Washington D.C., and a third in Florida related to allegations he improperly kept confidential documents after leaving office, as meritless and politically motivated.\n\nDuring Saturday's speech he circled back to his legal challenges several times to defend himself and blast what he argued is an unfair legal system manipulated by Democrats.\n\nHe also called Engoron \"crooked\" and \"a lunatic,\" saying, \"Hopefully, the whole thing is going to be thrown out and reversed.\"\n\nTrump's supporters have largely agreed with his arguments about the cases against him: He has only solidified his hold on the Republican Party despite the legal challenges he has faced and his efforts to reverse the 2020 loss to Biden even though he has shown no evidence of the widespread fraud he alleged. He is widely expected to win Michigan's Feb. 27 Republican primary and a follow-up GOP caucus-like convention the following weekend; his only opposition at this point is his former ambassador to the United Nations and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\n\"My poll numbers are much higher today ... because of this,\" Trump said in reference to the many criminal and civil court actions he faces.\n\nBut the legal questions could hurt him with independent voters and if he becomes president again, he will have no authority to pardon himself for any non-federal issue, such as the cases in New York.\n\nTrump made his way to Michigan as an eager crowd stood outside in sub-freezing temperatures hoping to get in to see him; earlier in the day, he made what was considered an unusual detour for a campaigning former president, pushing $399 gold Trump-branded sneakers at the \"Sneaker Con\" gathering in Philadelphia. The Associated Press reported he was met there with boos.\n\nBut in Waterford, he was greeted with a standing ovation and cheers as he argued that the switch to selling electric vehicles or EVs will result in fewer auto jobs, a contention which is true, though there are efforts underway to transfer lost jobs into related manufacturing. Meanwhile, his claims that autoworkers are all \"going to be out of work in two years\" as Chinese manufacturers take over the EV market is wild speculation: While China dominates much of the supply chain for materials for EV batteries, billions have been invested in the U.S. to open new factories and create new supply chains for domestic production, in large part because of incentives created by the Biden administration.\n\nTrump noted the huge number of undocumented migrants crossing the Southern border, saying the border was far more secure when he was president and arguing that it has resulted in an explosion of crime. He invoked an image of \"illegal alien criminals crawling through your windows and going through your drawers.\"\n\nHe said since he left office — following an election he again baselessly claimed was fraudulent — the nation has become \"stupid\" again, a situation he said he would reverse if reelected.\n\n\"We will be the stupid country no longer,\" he said. \"We had it going, we built the greatest economy in the history of our country but we will get it back and we will do it again.\"\n\nTrump did oversee a strong economy, especially in terms of stock market gains, but it soured late in his term due to shutdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden has overseen large gains in the stock market and job market as well, with unemployment rates persistently low — but inflation soared following the pandemic and its increases have only been coming down significantly in recent months.\n\nWaterford Regional Fire Department Chief Matt Covey told the Free Press he was prepared to allow 2,000 people into the hangar for the Trump event and he believes nearly that number were admitted.\n\nBefore the speech, U.S. Rep. Lisa McClain, R-Bruce Township, said she expected to hear Trump tell the crowd \"how we're going to get our country back on track.\"\n\nTrump's speech also came at a time when there are warring factions within the state Republican Party, with the Republican National Committee (RNC) last week determining that former U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, who was Trump's ambassador to the Netherlands, was the official state party chairman after an election last month, even though Kristina Karamo, who was elected in 2023, continues to claim that election and her ouster was invalid.\n\nMcClain said now that the RNC has endorsed Hoekstra \"it's time for us to come together,\" adding: \"We need to understand who our enemy is.\" But even though Trump referred to Hoekstra several times during the speech, Karamo's allies say she is still chair and claimed Saturday a group of state committee members reelected her in a meeting that day.\n\nA court is expected to ultimately rule on the question but there is potential for confusion with the Republican presidential primary set for Feb. 27 and the state GOP set to have a convention to award nominating delegates to the candidates two days later on March 2. The competing chairs have said they each plan separate convention locations.\n\nOn Friday, Michigan Democrats held an online news conference to blast Trump and warn that a Trump victory in November would be bad news for Michigan and its workers, as well as the country. U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Ann Arbor, noted that many in the party dismissed her concerns when she warned of a potential Trump victory in 2016.\n\n“This time, I’m really scared to death what’s going to happen in this country,” Dingell said. Trump “doesn’t care about our auto industry; he doesn’t care about working people,\" she said.\n\nAhead of Trump's rally, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — a co-chair of Biden's reelection campaign — put out a statement arguing that as president Trump stood against workers, fought to overturn abortion access and allowed jobs to be moved overseas. \"Donald Trump creates division everywhere he goes, but we’ve come together to make our state more welcoming and more prosperous,\" she said. \"Michigan didn’t buy what Donald Trump was selling in 2020 and we won’t in 2024.\"\n\nBut Trump did win Michigan in 2016, although it was by a slim margin of less than 11,000 votes or about two-tenths of a percentage point. And there are many indications that he could win the state again this year, with voters widely disapproving of Biden's performance as president and polls showing him trailing Trump in several battleground states, including Michigan.\n\nA Fox News poll this week showed Trump 2 percentage points ahead of Biden in Michigan, 47%-45%, in a head-to-head matchup, though that was within the poll's margin of error. Trump's lead was bigger, at 42%-37%, when including independent candidates Robert Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West and Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nComplicating matters for Biden in Michigan is his support for Israel in its counterattack of Hamas in the Gaza Strip following terrorist attacks of last Oct. 7. With tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in the counterattacks, many progressives — as well as many members of southeastern Michigan's large Arab American and Muslim community — have demanded Biden call for a cease-fire, given the financial support the U.S. provides Israel.\n\nBiden, who made his first campaign visit of the year early this month, does have support in the state, however, including from the UAW, which endorsed his candidacy in January and held events on his behalf in Warren. UAW President Shawn Fain, fresh off a successful strike of the Detroit Three automakers — during which Biden became the first sitting president to walk a picket line — has vociferously denounced Trump as a \"scab\" and a member of the \"billionaire class.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has blasted back at Fain, calling him a \"dope\" and a \"weapon of mass destruction\" and arguing that by allowing the automakers to pursue a transition to selling more electric vehicles and not speaking out against the Biden administration's proposed rule to spur those sales, the UAW brass could cost autoworkers their jobs.\n\nAt the same time, the Biden campaign hasn't stayed pat as Trump tries to boost his base in Michigan ahead of a Feb. 27 primary he is widely expected to win. On Friday, it unveiled a 1-minute TV commercial, airing in Michigan and some other battleground states, criticizing Trump for comments in which he said he told a leader of a country that is part of NATO, the North American Treaty Organization, that if it didn't pay its share of the group's costs, he would encourage Russia to take any action it liked.\n\n\"No president has ever said anything like it,\" the ad says. \"It's shameful.\"\n\nStaff writer Phoebe Wall Howard contributed to this article.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: tspangler@freepress.com.

Usually supportive of the Russian campaign in Ukraine, many have criticized Moscow’s failure to predict a Ukrainian counteroffensive in Kharkiv, and the lack of troops and equipment in numbers capable of stopping a Ukrainian push.\n\nIn a nightly address Thursday, Zelensky claimed the country’s military had retaken more than 1,000 square kilometers of territory since the beginning of the month. Oleksii Hromov, the deputy head of the main operations directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, said Ukrainian forces were able to advance 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) in the Kharkiv region and liberate “more than 20 settlements.”\n\nThrough geolocation and the statements of the Ukrainian military, independent analysts and Russian military bloggers, it’s estimated that Ukrainian forces have taken well over 400 square kilometers of territory this week in the Kharkiv region.\n\nMeanwhile, some Russian troops in the Kharkiv region have deserted and abandoned their uniforms due to Russia’s “significant losses,” the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said, adding that the soldiers are hoping to blend in while wearing civilian clothing.\n\n“Personnel of the occupying forces in civilian clothes resort to desertion and try to return to the territory of the Russian Federation,” the General Staff said in a situational update Friday, claiming that 15 such cases had been observed.\n\nThe Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said that the Russian 202nd Motorized Rifle Regiment, “located in the Kharkiv region, withdrew from their positions and moved to the nearest forest. The unit was left without commanders and communications.”\n\nThe Directorate claimed that Russian soldiers were “calling to relatives with requests to contact the command and find out where they should go next.

So three times removed means three generations apart.\n\n\"The remarkable connection between Taylor Swift and Emily Dickinson is just one example of the incredible things you can discover when you explore your past,\" Jennifer Utley, the director of research for Ancestry, said in a press release Monday. \"Even if we don't know it, our pasts can influence our present.\"\n\nThe for-profit American genealogy company used its vast records to find that Swift and Dickinson are both descendants of Jonathan Gillette, a 17th century immigrant and early settler of Windsor, Connecticut (Swift's ninth great-grandfather and Dickinson's sixth great-grandfather).\n\nTaylor Swift 101:From poetry to business, college classes offer insights on 'Swiftology'\n\n\"It's really exciting,\" says Dr. Catherine Fairfield, a writing professor at Northeastern University who is an expert in gender studies and literature. \"Swifties have been really interested in the overlaps between Taylor Swift and Emily Dickinson, especially since the release of 'Evermore.'\"\n\nIn 2020, Swift made an announcement on Emily Dickson's birthday of Dec. 10 that she would release her ninth studio album \"Evermore\" at midnight. The \"tortured poet\" is familiar with Dickinson's work and has been quoted about how her writing process is inspired, \"If my lyrics sound like a letter written by Emily Dickinson's great grandmother while sewing a lace curtain, that's me writing in the quill genre.\"\n\n\"They've proven their timelessness,\" says Fairfield. \"Taylor Swift has shown her writing talent over the years and universities are studying her in real time. Emily Dickinson is a hallmark of English literature and poetics. There's a good chance we'll see both of them studied for a very long time.\"\n\nSwift's eleventh era, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" comes out on April 19, so the timing is particularly perfect. Fairfield says the true winner in all of this is poetry: \"2024 is a turn to poetry and I love it.\"\n\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/12/13/taylor-swift-songs-30-best-lyrics-all-her-albums/4179419002/", "title": "Taylor Swift's 85 best lyrics including '1989 (Taylor's Version)'", "text": "From \"I hope you think of me\" to \"all's well that ends well to end up with you,\" Taylor Swift’s lyrics have “enchanted” us for more than a decade and a half.\n\nTaylor Swift's years in the spotlight have taken listeners from her country roots in 2006's self-titled \"Taylor Swift\" to pop stardom, then surprise quarantine albums \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore, a triumphant return to her past with \"(Taylor's Version)\" re-recordings, and the vulnerable pop grooves of \"Midnights.\"\n\nCrossing genres and countless style choices, Swift has taken her place as a music icon. Longtime listeners know her discography all too well: They associate certain albums with specific periods of their lives and tether some of her most memorable lines to moments of their own.\n\n\"I have this formula for music. If I continue to write songs about my life, and my life is always changing, then my music will always be changing,\" Swift told USA TODAY in 2010. She was right.\n\nWe ranked Swift's 85 best song lyrics from over the years – some heartbreaking, some triumphant – all works of lyrical genius that her biggest fans can't help but to sing again and again.\n\nReview:Taylor Swift returns to pop with poetic 'Midnights,' her most deeply personal album yet\n\n85. \"Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me\" – \"Karma\" from “Midnights”\n\nWe don’t even care if the \"Conversations With Friends\" PR team put her up to this one.\n\n84. \"Lord, what will become of me / Once I've lost my novelty?\" – \"Nothing New (feat. Phoebe Bridgers) (Taylor’s Version)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nAlso us every time we update this article. Thanks for reading, everyone!\n\n83. \"I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost / Rip the Band-Aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw\" - \"Hits Different (Taylor's Version)\" from \"Midnights (The Til Dawn Edition)\"\n\nEven more than a Barbie reference, we love this playful acknowledgement of less-than-ideal past behaviors.\n\nMore:Billie Eilish, Taylor Swift, and the pressure – and shaming – of celebrity women changing their image\n\n82. \"Don’t treat me like some situation that needs to be handled / I’m fine with my spite and my tears, and my beers and my candles\" – \"Closure\" from \"Evermore\"\n\nA line that will go down in Swift’s breakup song hall of fame.\n\n81. \"While he was doing lines and crossing all of mine / someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI\" – \"Vigilante S---\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nIs \"No Body, No Crime\" … not a work of fiction? For those keeping score at home, this is the first cocaine reference of Swift's discography.\n\n80. “No amount of freedom gets you clean / I’ve still got you all over me” – “You All Over Me (feat. Maren Morris) (Taylor’s Version) (From The Vault)” from “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)”\n\nWe can never run away from our problems; Swift (and Morris) articulate that like the country queens they are.\n\n79. \"Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in\" – “Hoax” from \"Folklore\"\n\nBelieving in “faithless” love?! We have no choice but to stan a paradoxical queen.\n\n78. \"I washed my hands of us at the club / you made a mess of me\" - \"Hits Different (Taylor's Version)\" from \"Midnights (The Til Dawn Edition)\"\n\nWe’ve been feverishly washing our hands after listening to this lyric and are *looks in mirror* still messes.\n\n77. “The skeletons in both our closets plotted hard to f--- this up” – “Cowboy Like Me” from “Evermore”\n\nTwo people finding love against all odds: we love to see it.\n\n76. \"I find it dizzying / They're bringing up my history / But you weren’t even listening\" – \"Lavender Haze\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nA prerequisite to dating Swift: not caring that she’s got a big reputation.\n\n75. \"You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars / And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it in words.\" – \"You Are in Love\" from \"1989 (Deluxe Edition)\"\n\nPutting specific and universal feelings into words: What Swift does best.\n\n74. \"Lovelorn and nobody knows / Love thorns all over this rose / I'll pay the price, you won't\" – \"Slut!\" (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault) from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nShe knows she'll take all the heat from the heat of her latest passion and she's down to risk it anyway. This is Swift at her most sensual.\n\n73. \"You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes\" – \"Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince\" from \"Lover\"\n\nAll other games and prizes are canceled.\n\n72. “Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury” – “Happiness” from “Evermore”\n\nSelf-aware self-correction: classic Swift.\n\n71. \"Spiderboy, king of thieves / Weave your little webs of opacity\" – \"Karma\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nThe only version of \"Spider-Man\" we accept as canon at this juncture.\n\n70. \"It only hurts this much right now / Was what I was thinking the whole time / Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out / I'll be getting over you my whole life\" – \"Labrynth\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nOne of several lyrics Swift teased months prior in her New York University commencement speech.\n\nAll the pomp, circumstance:Taylor Swift delivers NYU commencement speech, receives honorary degree\n\n69. “Clover blooms in the fields / Spring breaks loose, the time is near” – “ivy” from “Evermore”\n\nSpring breaks? Get it? We sure do.\n\n68. \"Familiarity breeds contempt / So put mе in the basement / Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart\" – \"Bejeweled\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nThe casts of \"Selling Sunset,\" \"Selling Tampa\" and \"Selling the O.C.\" should be shaking.\n\n67. “Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion? / Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it / She's still 23 inside her fantasy” – “Right Where You Left Me - Bonus Track” from “Evermore”\n\nAnother case of tongue-in-cheek self-awareness from the queen of breakup songs reminds us that we're totally fine living inside the fantasy of Swift’s discography.\n\n66. \"I had a marvelous time ruining everything\" – \"The Last Great American Dynasty\" from \"Folklore\"\n\nGo ahead and save this one for your next Instagram caption.\n\n65. \"Please don't ever become a stranger whose laugh I could recognize anywhere\" – \"New Year's Day\" from \"Reputation\"\n\nSqueeze our hand three times, why don't you.\n\n'Evermore' review:Taylor Swift returns to the woods for a spellbinding 'Folklore' companion\n\n64. \"How can a person know everything at eighteen / But nothin' at twenty-two?\" – \"Nothing New (feat. Phoebe Bridgers) (Taylor’s Version)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nSpoiler alert: It only gets messier from there. We see you and thank you, Taylor.\n\n63. \"Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun / And when you’re close I feel like coming undone\" – \"Untouchable\" from \"Fearless\"\n\nSnappy, romantic, poetic: The Taylor Swift trifecta.\n\n62. \"Foolish one / Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love / That ain't never gonna come\" - \"Foolish One (Taylor's Version) from \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nSwift has written a lot of relatable lyrics in her career, but now she's just straight up attacking us.\n\nReview:'Folklore' is the album Taylor Swift was born to make\n\n61. \"You drew stars around my scars but now I’m bleeding\" – “Cardigan” from “Folklore”\n\nOK, the rhyming of “stars” and “scars” on its own is enough to send our hearts all a-flutter. But the violent shift to “bleeding” shows how even though we may heal, it doesn’t take much to send us spiraling now and again. We’re bleeding (metaphorically) with you, Taylor.\n\n60. \"The only way back to my dignity / Was to turn into a shrouded mystery / Just like I had been when you were chasing me / Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk\" – \"Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nMuch like \"The Last Great American Dynasty\" and \"You're On Your Own, Kid,\" Swift has a penchant for twisting stories just before they end. A melancholy moment swirls into a sweeping siren call.\n\n59. \"Barefoot in the kitchen / Sacred new beginnings / That became my religion, listen\" – \"Cornelia Street\" from \"Lover\"\n\nSwift's storytelling works best with tiny details like these.\n\n58. \"I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me\" – \"New Romantics\" from \"1989\"\n\nThis is a very tall castle, if you think about Scooter Braun, Katy Perry and Kimye.\n\n57. \"My castle crumbled overnight / I brought a knife to a gunfight / They took the crown but it's alright\" – \"Call It What You Want\" from \"Reputation\"\n\nReferencing your own lyrics? Ultimate power move.\n\n56. \"So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it / You've got no reason to be afraid / You're on your own, kid / Yeah you can face this\" – \"You're On Your Own, Kid\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nWe love this moment in the song where terror twists into triumph.\n\n55. \"Back then we didn't know / We were built to fall apart / We broke the status quo / Then we broke each other's hearts\" – \"The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nCould this be the prequel to \"Out of The Woods?\" Again, referencing your own past lyrics is simply iconic, legendary behavior.\n\n54. “He's got my past frozen behind glass / But I've got me” – “It’s Time To Go - Bonus Track” from “Evermore”\n\nThis melancholy summation of Swift's public battle against music executive Scooter Braun for her masters (the reason she's rerecording her first six studio albums) is heartbreakingly weary. Luckily, her rerecordings have begun to serve as a triumphant reclaiming of the old works that got her here.\n\n53. \"And if you never saved me from boredom / I could have gone on as I was / But, lord, you made me feel important / And then you tried to erase us\" – \"Would've Could've Should've\" from \"Midnights (3am Edition)\"\n\nThe Dear John letters continue — and only get more vitriolic.\n\n52. \"Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart / Now I send their babies presents\" – \"Invisible String\" from \"Folklore\"\n\nFrom exposing your teenage ex-boyfriend for dumping you over the phone to sending gifts to his newborn: That's forever and always for you.\n\n51. \"He says he's so in love / He's finally got it right / I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night\" – \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" from \"Taylor Swift\"\n\nNo, you're crying over a musical instrument.\n\nReview:Taylor Swift is a kid again on 'Lover,' a big, messy embrace of a new album\n\n50. \"Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday but I realized some bigger dreams of mine / And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind\" – \"Fifteen\" from \"Fearless\"\n\nBigger dreams? Try 12-time winner and 46-time nominee at the Grammys, two-time Time 100 Most Influential People recipient and 2019 American Music Awards Artist of the Decade honoree. Wish you could go back and tell yourself that.\n\n49. \"Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme\" – \"Holy Ground\" from \"Red\"\n\nIn the first moments of her first pop-but-not-technically-pop album, Swift proved to naysayers that her lyrical genius isn't defined to one genre.\n\n48. “’Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be / So I'll say words I don't believe” – \"Bigger Than the Whole Sky\" from \"Midnights (3am Edition)\"\n\nA perfect distillation of how we try and rationalize heartbreak. We’re taking notes.\n\n47. \"I once believed love would be burning red / But it's golden\" – \"Daylight\" from \"Lover\"\n\nAcknowledging she's grown from \"Red\" but appreciating it as a part of her past enough to include it on her latest album? We don't know a better person.\n\n46. I think I've seen this film before / And I didn't like the ending / You're not my homeland anymore / So what am I defending now? – “Exile” from “Folklore”\n\nA classic excellent Taylor Swift lyrical run. Defend us, Taylor, please!\n\n45. \"'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings / I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring\" - \"Foolish One (Taylor's Version) from \"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nTaylor loves hitting us over the head with marriage imagery, and \"Foolish One\" is no different. That said, she can hit us over the head anytime she wants. These lines feel like a prequel to \"Speak Now,\" though that song feels more like a fantasy than ever with this context.\n\n44. \"He said the way my blue eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said, 'That's a lie'\" – \"Tim McGraw\" from \"Taylor Swift\"\n\nNo offense to Georgia stars, obviously.\n\n43. “I want auroras and sad prose / I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet / ‘Cause I haven’t moved in years / And I want you right here” – “The Lakes” from “Folklore”\n\nSwift waxes poetic about finding happiness in quiet moments of solitude with her “lover,” and we couldn’t be happier for her.\n\n'Reputation' review:A fully-formed look at Taylor Swift in love, and in control\n\n42. “It takes everything in me just to get up each day / But it’s wonderful to see that you’re OK” – \"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault)\" from \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nThe sarcasm jumped out and did a backflip. How perfect(ly fine).\n\n41. \"You kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever\" – \"Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault)\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nI mean, need we say any more? Damn.\n\n40. \"I snuck in through the garden gate / Every night that summer just to seal my fate\" – \"Cruel Summer\" from \"Lover\"\n\nWho wouldn't want to traipse around through gardens all summer long?\n\n39. \"But she wears short skirts / I wear T-shirts / She's cheer captain / And I'm on the bleachers\" – \"You Belong With Me\" from \"Fearless\"\n\nBefore \"Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince,\" there was \"You Belong With Me.\" Swift captures the high school experience so effortlessly it's like we never graduated.\n\n38. \"I never grew up, it's getting so old\" – \"The Archer\" from \"Lover\"\n\nIn which Swift lays out in eight words just how aware she is of all the criticisms thrown at her (and also sneaks in a reference to \"Never Grow Up\" track from \"Speak Now\").\n\n37. “You booked the night train for a reason / So you could sit there in this hurt” – “Champagne Problems” from “Evermore”\n\nWe imagine this is what it would sound like if Journey actually did stop believing.\n\n36. \"And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes / I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age\" – \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nHell hath no fury like a Taylor Swift scorned. Of all the daggers she's written over the years about former flames, this is one of her most pointed.\n\n35. \"But I took your matches before fire could catch me / So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town\" – \"Dear John\" from \"Speak Now\"\n\nTalk about a Dear John letter. Ouch.\n\nMore:All the new songs, notable lyrics and biggest changes on Taylor Swift's rerecorded 'Fearless'\n\n34. \"Take the words for what they are: A dwindling, mercurial high / A drug that only worked the first few hundred times\" – \"Illicit Affairs\" from \"Folklore\"\n\n\"Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me\" – us, after listening to Swift sing about the devastation of feeling like you're losing the person you love.\n\n33. \"You did a number on me / But honestly, baby, who’s counting?\" – \"So It Goes...\" from \"Reputation\"\n\nTaylor reinvented math with 11 iconic words. Who is counting?\n\n32. “I made you my temple, my mural, my sky / Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life” – “Tolerate It” from “Evermore”\n\nDeath by a thousand cuts in a single sentence, from, yes, the singer of “Death By a Thousand Cuts.” Honorable mention to the line that follows: “Drawing hearts in the byline,” which we can only assume was about us.\n\n31. \"I knew you dancing in your Levis, drunk under a streetlight\" – \"Cardigan\" from \"Folklore\"\n\nSwift loves writing these tiny details about knowing someone intimately. And we love her for it.\n\n30. \"That night we couldn't quite forget / When we decided to move the furniture so we could dance / Baby, like we stood a chance\" – \"Out of the Woods\" from \"1989\"\n\nGetting lost never sounded so good.\n\n29. \"It never ever occurred to you / That I can't say 'hello' to you / And risk another goodbye\" – \"I Almost Do\" from \"Red\"\n\nThose chills you feel? Yeah, we get those reading these every time. \"Hello\" and \"goodbye\" never seemed so loaded.\n\n28. \"You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor\" – \"Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nAgain, we get a sensual Swift. But she's not just sensual – she's seething, smart and sophisticated.\n\n27. \"And if I get burned, at least we were electrified\" – \"Dress\" from \"Reputation\"\n\nThis girl is on fire, indeed.\n\n26. \"From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\" – \"You’re On Your Own, Kid\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nDid Taylor watch \"Call Me By Your Name\" before writing this one?! We couldn’t help but get lost in these spellbinding scenes.\n\nTaylor Swift promises to re-record music after losing rights to Scooter Braun\n\n25. \"Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?\" – \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nLines like this in the 10-minute version have us feeling all too unwell.\n\n24. “Should've kept every grocery store receipt / 'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me” – “Marjorie” from “Evermore”\n\nFrom the woman who brought you “I’m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here,” we bring you this glorious run. This song hits particularly different during the coronavirus pandemic as a nation overrun with morbidity turns to music for solace.\n\n23. \"I didn't have it in myself to go with grace / 'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave – “My Tears Ricochet” from \"Folklore\"\n\nThe “used to” does all the work here. Our tears haven’t stopped ricocheting since listening.\n\n22. \"The monsters turned out to be just trees / When the sun came up you were looking at me\" – \"Out of the Woods\" from \"1989\"\n\n\"Where the Wild Things Are\" got the rewrite it never asked for, and we are not complaining.\n\n21. \"I’m damned if I do give a damn what people say\" – \"Lavender Haze\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nOh Tay, you just don’t miss. The word \"damn\" never held so much power.\n\n20. \"The night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same / You held your head like a hero / On a history book page / It was the end of a decade / But the start of an age\" – \"Long Live\" from \"Speak Now\"\n\nProduction on this album began in 2009, the year Swift turned 20, and wrapped in 2010. What a decade – and an age – the 2010s were for her.\n\nLooking back on 'Fearless':On its 10-year anniversary, Taylor Swift's 'Fearless' is still a classic\n\n19. \"'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl / I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her\" – \"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault) from \"Fearless\" (Taylor's Version)\n\nWe're not sure how Swift pulled this off but she actually picked up our hearts and threw them on the ground while we listened to these lyrics. All \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\" fellas out there should take notes.\n\n18. \"At least I had the decency / To keep my nights out of sight / Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs / And my whispered sighs\" – \"Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)\" from \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nWhoever this is about – or if it's about no one at all – best to duck and cover. Swift's lyrics are, to quote another song, \"better than revenge.\"\n\n17. \"I can't decide if it's a choice: getting swept away\" – \"Treacherous\" from \"Red\"\n\n*Swoons*\n\n16. \"No one wanted to play with me as a little kid / So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since\" – \"Mastermind\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nWe could really pick any run from this song, but wow, do we vibe with this honesty. If there’s a single line to sum up Swift’s career, it may be this one.\n\n15. \"With every guitar string scar on my hand / I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover\" – \"Lover\" from \"Lover\"\n\nFor longtime Swifties, there's nothing sweeter than hearing her triumphantly declare she's in love.\n\n14. \"I wouldn't marry me either / A pathological people pleaser / Who only wanted you to see her\" - \"You're Losing Me\" from \"Midnights (The Late Night Edition)\"\n\nFor someone who has never been married, she's definitely got it on her mind. The sequel to \"Champagne Problems' we never wanted comes through in \"You're Losing Me,\" with an alliterative bridge that soars line after line. We're \"choosing\" you, Taylor, you'll never lose us.\n\n13. “And you wanna scream, ‘don't call me kid, don't call me baby / Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me’” – “Illicit Affairs” from “Folklore”\n\nIf you’re not screaming along to these lyrics every time, you’re doing it wrong.\n\n12.“The road not taken looks real good now” – \"‘Tis the Damn Season” from “Evermore”\n\nRobert Frost who? Anyone else’s spin of the oft-referenced poem would come off as cliché. But Swift’s artful turn of phrase has us over here thinking about our (non-toxic) exes.\n\n11. \"It's me / Hi / I'm the problem, it's me\" – \"Anti-Hero\" from \"Midnights\"\n\nOur therapists will be hearing about this.\n\n10. \"They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell / Every time you double-cross my mind\" – \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nThe WORDPLAY. William Shakespeare himself could never.\n\n9. \"Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it / I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it / After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own / Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone\" – \"All Too Well\" from \"Red\"\n\nIt's a testament that we can't cut this down any shorter. \"All Too Well\" – and its extended cut – wins everything. End of story.\n\n8. \"You held your pride like you should have held me\" – \"The Story of Us\" from \"Speak Now\"\n\nSavage, before savage became a part of our mainstream lexicon. Swift is the queen of the snappy turn of phrase.\n\n7. \"They told me all of my cages were mental / So I got wasted like all my potential\" – \"This is Me Trying\" from \"Folklore\"\n\nAnother beautifully written turn of phrase. She's still got it, 10 years later.\n\n6. \"You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\" – \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)\" from \"Red (Taylor's Version)\"\n\nWe need to scream this in a crowded bar ASAP. Now that’s an oath.\n\n5. \"I'm still a believer but I don't know why / I've never been a natural / All I do is try, try, try – “Mirrorball” from \"Folklore\"\n\nThat repetitive “try, try, try” sends us spinning. We recommend checking out the Las Culturistas analysis of “Folklore” track-by-track, if you haven’t already, for an apt take on “Mirrorball” and Taylor Swift’s incredible work ethic.\n\n4. \"You said it was a great love, one for the ages / But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?\" – \"Death By a Thousand Cuts\" from \"Lover\"\n\nThe queen of breakup songs used to worry about what would happen when she was happily in a relationship, but rejoiced when she woke up one day with lyrics in her mind that would eventually become \"Cuts.\"\n\n\"I was like, 'it's still here! Yes!\" she said in her NPR Tiny Desk Concert. \"This song is my proof. I don't have to stop writing about heartbreak and misery. Which, for me, is incredible news.\"\n\n3. \"You can plan for a change in weather and time / But I never planned on you changing your mind\" – \"Last Kiss\" from \"Speak Now\"\n\nDon't mind us, but we'll go sit on the floor, listening to this one on repeat.\n\n2. \"You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter / You are the best thing that's ever been mine\" – \"Mine\" from \"Speak Now\"\n\nEat your hearts out, careless men.\n\n1. \"You call me up again just to break me like a promise / So casually cruel in the name of being honest\" – \"All Too Well\" from \"Red\"\n\nThis gem of a lyric has everything you could possibly want. Simile? Alliteration? Heartbreak?

It comes on the heels of a Swift-themed class at New York University last spring that ended with the singer as the commencement speaker.\n\nEnglish Professor Elizabeth Scala told CNN that she picked Swift because the pop star writes her own music and her lyrics can help illuminate similar techniques from classic poetry.\n\n“This is a course on her songs as literary writing and the ways a popular and award-winning writer uses the same literary devices, figures, and tropes of traditional poetry in her work,” she said. “It is not about celebrity or fame.”\n\nTaylor Swift attends New York University's commencement ceremony on May 18, 2022. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\nStudents will study Swift’s songs alongside the writings of Western literature greats.\n\n“They’ll be asked to analyze and contextualize common practices and problems across the centuries,” Scala said.\n\nScala is a self-described Swift fan and said her goal is to teach literary traditions through a contemporary lens.\n\n“I want to take what Swift fans can already do at a sophisticated level, tease it out for them a bit with a different vocabulary, and then show them how, in fact, Swift draws on richer literary traditions in her songwriting, both topically but also formally in terms of how she uses references, metaphors, and clever manipulations of words,” Scala said.\n\n“I’ll be showing students that these operations and interpretive moves one makes when reading her songs are appropriate to all forms of writing.”\n\nThis being 2022, Scala also has set up an Instagram for the class on which she posts Swift trivia and poses questions to fans.\n\nThe class will mostly focus on songs from Swift’s recent albums, but students are free to bring up older songs for discussion, Scala said. With most of the lyrics posted online and the songs available on Apple Music or Spotify, students don’t have to buy music for the class, she said.\n\nThe course also will address topics such as gender, authenticity, fans’ influence on artists and writers, and how language history and linguistic traditions enrich the reading experience, Scala said.\n\n“I think it’s important to connect the curriculum to the present, but I’m not willing to cede the past. This is my way of sneaking the older material back in with relevance,” she added.\n\nIn 2015, UT Austin introduced a class titled, “Beyoncé Feminism, Rihanna Womanism” to explore Black feminism. Other universities also have made headlines for courses centered on pop stars, including the University of Copenhagen’s “Beyoncé, Gender and Race” and a University of South Carolina sociology course dedicated to the work of Lady Gaga.\n\nNext spring, Texas State University will offer a class on British pop singer Harry Styles.", "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/02/06/jet-tracker-taylor-swift-ucf-jack-sweeney-social-media-twitter-x-reddit-mastadon-bluesky/72491332007/", "title": "Taylor Swift asks jet tracker Jack Sweeney to stop posting her info", "text": "Taylor Swift is telling a UCF student she doesn't belong with him. Or at least not with his airplane-tracking social media account that keeps tabs on her whereabouts.\n\nThe student is pushing back.\n\n“This information is already out there,” the 21-year-old student told the Washington Post. “Her team thinks they can control the world.”\n\nIn December, attorneys for the pop music superstar threatened legal action against Jack Sweeney, a junior at the University of Central Florida, who has managed social media accounts tracking the movements of celebrities, politicians and billionaires for years. Last year then-Twitter CEO Elon Musk fought back against his own publicly available travel information — which he called \"assassination coordinates\" — getting posted on his own service and first tried to buy @ElonJet from Sweeney and then, after Sweeney refused, shut down the account and threatened legal action.\n\nSweeney made another account, called @ElonJetNextDay, which displays results delayed at least 24 hours. Since then has also added Russian oligarchs, more celebrities, and Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhy is Swift, arguably one of the world's biggest stars, asking him to stop?\n\nWho is Jack Sweeney?\n\nSweeney is a junior studying computer science at UCF with a lifelong interest in aviation. While he was still a teenager he created software called bots to track and share the location of several prominent billionaires such as Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Mark Cuban, Donald Trump, Bill Gates and the rapper Drake, along with departing and arriving cities, cost of fuel used and amount of CO2 emissions created. The information from his accounts has been used to shame celebrities and other famous people for their \"disproportionately high\" impact on climate change.\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine he created @RUOligarchJets to track the movements of about 30 Russian oligarchs, although he admitted info from Russia was sketchy. That X (formerly Twitter) account, along with his others, was suspended in December 2022 for violating site rules.\n\nNow using Instagram, Facebook, Mastodon and Bluesky accounts, Sweeney currently tracks Musk and DeSantis, Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, and an assortment of celebrities including Tom Cruise, A-Rod, Kenny Chesney, Dan Bilzerian, Blake Shelton and John Travolta. An account tracking former president Donald Trump runs on Trump's own social media, Truth Social, although it does not update regularly.\n\nWho is UCF student Jack Sweeney?Taylor Swift asks jet tracker of the rich and famous to stop posting her info\n\nWhy is Taylor Swift suing jet tracker Jack Sweeney?\n\nNo lawsuits have been filed. In December Swift's attorney sent Sweeney a cease-and-desist letter, according to the Washington Post, threatening \"legal remedies\" if he didn't stop \"stalking and harassing\" her and causing her and her family and heightened her \"constant state of fear for her personal safety.\"\n\n“While this may be a game to you, or an avenue that you hope will earn you wealth or fame, it is a life-or-death matter for our Client,” attorney Katie Wright Morrone wrote in a letter shared with the Post.\n\nSwift, 34, who on Sunday became the artist with the most \"album of the year\" Grammys ever on the same night she announced her new album, has been the target of multiple stalkers over the years, including one who was arrested three times in five days last month outside the artist's New York City home.\n\nA Texas man was sentenced to 30 months in prison in 2020 after he pleaded guilty to stalking and sending her threats. A Florida man who served six months in 2018 for breaking into her Manhattan townhouse and falling asleep in her bed was arrested again the next year for smashing a glass door to get back inside.\n\nSwift opened up about her stalkers in an essay for Elle in 2019 where she talked about websites posting all her home addresses and the first aid equipment she keeps on her at all times.\n\n\"You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things,\" she said. \"Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\"\n\n'Florida!!!':Florida lands a track title on Taylor Swift’s new album ‘Tortured Poets Department’\n\nSwift's spokesperson did not present evidence that any stalkers had used Sweeney's information, the Washington Post said, but said the timing of the stalkers suggested a connection.\n\nSwift's legions of fans may use it more than stalkers do, as they comb over everything remotely Swift-related to find clues about the singer-songwriter's upcoming albums, special promotions and other events. Most recently Swifties have feverishly been going over flight details to try and work out if she'll be able to make it from a concert in Tokyo to the Super Bowl to watch partner and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nSweeney told the Post that the information was public data and offered only a suggestion as to which cities she might be in, similar to a concert (or NFL) schedule. He also mentioned she had been under fire at that time for her flights' excessive CO2 emissions in an analysis that labeled her \"the biggest celebrity CO2e polluter of this year.\" (The spokesperson said that Swift wasn't responsible as she often loaned her jet out to other people, and she bought more than double the carbon credits needed for her latest tour to offset her own travel).\n\nSweeny's X account @SwiftJetNextDay currently tracks her jets with a 24-hour delay, although he also maintains accounts on Reddit, Bluesky and other social media.\n\nHow did Sweeney respond to Taylor Swift?\n\nOn Monday, Feb. 21, Sweeney came out swinging with an X post titled \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" name-dropping the title track from Swift's 2017 \"Reputation\" album and adding the letter his own attorney sent back to the pop star's legal team in response.\n\n\"Put simply, there is nothing unlawful about GRNDCTRL's use of publicly accessible information to track private jets, including those by public figures like Taylor Swift,\" wrote Sweeney's attorney, James Slater.\n\nSweeney also shared the two letters sent to him by Swift's team.\n\nDoes jet tracker Jack Sweeney track Ron DeSantis' flights?\n\nAfter the Florida governor signed bills to keep his travel records private and exempted from the state's Sunshine laws, Sweeney added a DeSantis tracker. He told Insider he expected interest in DeSantis to rise when the governor declared his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nThe @DeSantisJet account has a 24-hour delay but other social media versions do not.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/02/11/taylor-swift-11th-album-tortured-poets-department-everything-to-know/72508862007/", "title": "Taylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department': Everything we know", "text": "Taylor Swift will release her 11th album on April 19, and here’s everything we know about “The Tortured Poets Department,” or \"Tortured Poets\" for short.\n\nThere are 16 tracks plus a different bonus track on four versions of the album (20 songs in total). At the Grammys, Swift announced version one would include \"The Manuscript.\" In Melbourne, Australia, Swift announced a second version with a different bonus track, \"The Bolter.\" In Sydney, Australia, she announced a third version with the track \"The Albatross.\" In Singapore, she announced a fourth and final version with the track \"The Black Dog.\"\n\nPost Malone and Florence and The Machine are two contributors on what appears to be a break-up album. The titles are brutal. Fans speculate the album is about Swift’s six-year relationship to English actor Joe Alwyn. Both stars kept the relationship out of the public eye. The back of the first version of the album reads, “I love you, it’s ruining me,” which may serve as a dagger-to-the-chest harbinger.\n\nKeep scrolling for an analysis of what the track titles may mean.\n\nWhat tracks are on 'Tortured Poets Department'?\n\nSide A:\n\n\"Fortnight\" (ft.

On Feb. 4, the singer won her 13th career Grammy for pop vocal album.\n\n\"I want to say thank you to the fans,\" Swift said in her acceptance speech, \"by telling you a secret that I've been keeping from you for the past two years, which is that my brand-new album comes out April 19.\"\n\nDuring her first Tokyo concert later that week, Swift said she intended to announce the album in Japan but switched to the Grammys.\n\n\"I had this plan in my head and I told my friends, I told Jack (Antonoff), but I hadn’t really told many other people,\" she said. \"I thought, 'OK, so if I’m lucky enough to win one thing tonight, I’m just going to do it. I’m just going to announce my new album.'\"\n\nVersion one of the album included the bonus track \"The Manuscript.\"\n\nWhat are 'The Bolter,' 'The Albatross' and 'The Black Dog'?\n\nDuring night one in Melbourne, Swift spoke from the piano of her acoustic set, which she never does. (She usually finishes the guitar song and heads straight for the keys to play her second surprise song.)\n\n\"'Tortured Poets' is an album,\" she said to the packed stadium of 96,000 screaming fans, \"I think more than any of my albums that I've ever made, I needed to make it. It was really a lifeline for me. Just the things I was going through, the things I was writing about. It kind of reminded me of why songwriting was something that actually gets me through my life.\"\n\nSwift added a second vinyl with a different bonus track, \"The Bolter.\" The back of the album has the words, \"You don't get to tell me about sad.\"\n\nSwift did the same thing in Sydney, announcing to 81,000 fans on night one her special edition \"The Albatross.\" A third version of cover art included the phrase, \"Am I allowed to cry?\"\n\nOn night two in Singapore, she announced a fourth and final variant to a crowd of 60,000 titled \"The Black Dog\" with the phrase \"Old habits die screaming.\"\n\nWhat were the Easter eggs?\n\nHours before the Grammys, TaylorSwift.com “crashed” showing an “Error 321 Backend fetch failed.” Error 321 is a communication error that would appear on a fax machine with a poor telephone line connection. Below, “hneriergrd:” appeared to be an unscrambled version of “red herring,” which is a clue or piece of information intended to be misleading or distracting. And underneath that was “DPT: 123.” DPT backwards is TPD, \"Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nSwift loves to keep her fandom guessing. The clown emoji and term “clowning” is common in the community because fans will build a case pointing to a possible Swift announcement and be completely wrong. In the instance of \"TTPD,\" Swift made it seem like she was going to announce the rerelease of “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)” in Japan. Two weeks before opening night at the Tokyo Dome, Swift changed the subtitles of her music video “Look What You Made Me Do” to Japanese. At the end of the “Karma (Remix)” music video, she held a coffee cup. Her blue fingernail was positioned by the eight (blue signifying “1989” and eight meaning an August announcement) and a black nail by the two (black is the color of “Reputation” and two is February).\n\nBut this follows her pattern of two rereleases then a new project. In 2021, she announced “Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” and “Red (Taylor’s Version)” before announcing “Midnights” in 2022. In 2023, she surprised Eras Tour audiences with artwork from “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” during two acoustic sets.\n\nIf she continues the pattern, “Reputation (Taylor’s Version)” and her debut album may not be announced until next year. Or maybe there will be a glitch and she’ll coordinate “New Year’s Day,” a song off of the sixth album, with ringing in 2025.\n\nWhat is the aesthetic of 'TTPD'?\n\nEvery era has a different color associated with it. This looks like this will be the “white heart” era as Swift has shared the emoji as her Instagram story highlight for TTPD.\n\nThe motif of the album is like a scene from a black-and-white detective show from the early-to-mid 1900s. The faded photos and evidence folders seem to point to tracing evidence in the death of a relationship, which the titles echo.\n\nCoders found that the backend of Swift’s site included several words that match the vibe: “chairman,” “bruises,” “veins,” “cadence,” “apple cake,” “talisman,” “love bombs,” “muse,” “ink,” “evidence” and “fake.”\n\nWhy April 19th?\n\nSwift is a mastermind and very intentional not just with songs, track titles and announcements, but also release dates. April 19 has two significances that may make it the perfect day for the debut of the 11th era. Historically, in 1775, April 19th was the day the American Revolutionary War started when shots rang out in Lexington, Lincoln and Concord, Massachusetts. Thus began the split of the U.S. from Great Britain, so long London. Again, it could be a metaphoric nod to her split from Alwyn.\n\nApril 19th is also \"National Poetry and the Creative Mind Day.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for the Eras Tour?\n\nSwift has a break from the Eras Tour between March 9 (when she wraps a six-night stint in Singapore) and May 9 (when she begins again in Paris, France). The album will come out on April 19 which begs the question of how will it be incorporated into the three-plus-hour show?\n\nWill she take the 20 songs and make them a part of her surprise songs? Will she add a new era? Will she open the show with \"TTPD\"? If that’s the case, will she cut from other eras or take this show to four hours? The Eras Tour continues to break records, boost local economies and evolve. Time won't fly, but it will tell the answers to these questions.\n\nWhat could the track titles mean?\n\nNothing is confirmed or certain until the album comes out, but here are some possibilities of what Swift's 11th era may entail.\n\n\"Fortnight\" (ft. Post Malone)\n\nA fortnight is a two-week period or 14 days. Swift loves numerology, and her favorite number is 13. In an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe (ahead of the Super Bowl), Post Malone said, \"She's so sweet and so kind and talented and she hit me up and said, 'Let's do it.' And I was like, ‘Hell yeah.’”\n\nHe didn't discuss any other details but said he can't wait to hear it.\n\n\"The Tortured Poets Department\"\n\nHalf of Swift’s albums have not had a title track including debut, “1989,” “Reputation,” “Folklore” and “Midnights.\" When Swift announced \"TTPD,\" she tweeted out handwritten lyrics which may be on this track: “And so I enter into evidence / My tarnished coat of arms / My muses, acquired like bruises / My talismans and charms / Tick, tick, tick of love bombs / My veins of pitch black ink / All’s fair in love and poetry… Sincerely, The Chairman of The Tortured Poets Department.”\n\n\"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\"\n\nA title about self-sabotage.\n\n\"Down Bad\"\n\nMerriam-Webster defines this slang as “in a bad state or condition” such as being depressed or “marked with strong and usually unrequited feelings of attraction, desire or infatuation.”\n\n\"So Long, London\"\n\nTrack five on each of Swift’s albums is usually the most heart-wrenching. “So Long, London” is intentionally placed and may be an open, but tragic love letter to England’s capital.\n\n\"But Daddy I Love Him\"\n\nThis line is iconic in the “Little Mermaid” when King Triton finds out that Ariel loves Prince Eric and he forbids her from pursuing him. It’s trying to convince an authoritative figure (…maybe even yourself) that your emotions outweigh logic and a relationship that’s run its course may still work.\n\n\"Fresh Out the Slammer\"\n\nThe slammer is slang for jail or prison, metaphorically speaking, it’s getting out of a relationship.\n\n\"Florida!!!\" (ft. Florence + The Machine)\n\nA week before her split with Alwyn, Swift switched the first song of her “Folklore” set from “Invisible String,” a song about two people being destined for one another, to “The 1,” a retrospective song about what might have been. Her first concert after news broke of the ended relationship was in Tampa, Florida.\n\n\"Guilty as Sin?\"\n\nGuilty as sin is a matter of fact statement that someone is, without a doubt, culpable in a crime. The question mark in this track title shows the turmoil of knowing a certainty but then having to second guess it. This was also the name of a 1993 movie in which a female lawyer represents a man accused of killing his wife. As she digs into his past, she reaches a moral dilemma and grapples with the possibility of betraying her client.\n\n\"Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me?\"\n\nThis title may be a nod to “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” The classic play, written in 1962 by Edward Albee, is a dark comedy about an older couple who invite young houseguests over for a dysfunctional and cruel night of fun of games.\n\n\"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\"\n\nCall a therapist because there’s a lot to unpack with this title. It may be about a toxic relationship in which one party perceives the other as the problem or having defective qualities. It’s an assertion of wanting to control a situation.\n\n\"loml\"\n\n“loml” stands for “love of my life.” This could be a reflective track filled with fond memories, or it could be a sarcastic and jaded take. Swift sometimes songs in the complete opposite direction of their titles, like in one of her most melancholic songs, “Happiness.”\n\n\"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\"\n\nSwift worked on the album for two years. She started writing it after “Midnights” in 2021. She wrote it during her massively successful Eras Tour. In 2022, Swift talked to Jimmy Fallon about “Midnights” and incessantly putting pen to paper. “I love writing songs, poems, stories, scripts,” she said. “In the last six or seven years, I’ve just been constantly making things. And the more things I make, the happier I am. So I’ve just continued to do it.” She can do what is expected of her and more, even with a shattered heart.\n\n\"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived\"\n\nCalling someone a small man is to say they are ordinary without anything special: wealth, fame, power, etc. Adding the superlative “who ever lived” means there has never been anyone smaller… like ever.\n\n\"The Alchemy\"\n\nAlchemy is an ancient branch of chemical science and philosophy used to discover the possibility of a universal cure for diseases or a prolonged (maybe even indefinite) life.\n\n\"Clara Bow\"\n\nThe American actress appeared in 46 silent films. Investors knew fans would fill the seats if her name was in the credits. The black-and-white motif of \"The Tortured Poets Department\" matches a movie Bow would have starred in during the Roaring '20s.\n\n\"The Manuscript\" (bonus track)\n\nIs this clever word play for “Man U Script” or is this is a song meant to be the exclamation point of hard work on TTPD? Manuscripts are books, documents, or music pieces written by hand. There is a feeling of personalization, originality and ownership, something Swift has advocated for throughout her career and quest to reclaim her music. The physicality of a manuscript means created with your own hands.\n\n\"The Bolter\" (bonus track)\n\nSimply, a bolter can refer to leaving in a mad, hurried and nervous dash for the door. Merriam-Webster has a second definition of \"a failed attempt to land on an aircraft carrier that occurs when an aircraft's tailhook misses the arresting gear on the carrier's deck so that the aircraft is required to take off again without stopping.\" This could point to a person rapidly exiting a relationship or the back-and-forth, on again, off again, miscommunication in a relationship.\n\n\"The Albatross\" (bonus track)\n\nAn albatross is one of the largest seabirds with a white torso and long, slender, black-tipped wings. Some Swifties say this was recreated in Swift's Grammy dress with long, black gloves. The term can also reference something that causes deep concern or anxiety or greatly hinders accomplishment. Merriam-Webster's example sentence may hit the nail on the head for this song: \"Fame has become an albatross that prevents her from leading a normal life.\"\n\n\"The Black Dog\" (bonus track)\n\nA \"black dog\" is a term referring to feelings of depression, great sadness and lack of energy, according to the Cambridge Dictionary. In English literature and folklore, a black dog was a legend of a demonic hellhound that served as an omen of death.\n\nFollow Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/02/05/taylor-swift-track-list-tortured-poets-department-collaborations/72487683007/", "title": "Taylor Swift drops track list for new album, including collaborations", "text": "\"I love you, it's ruining my life.\"\n\nTaylor Swift shared on Monday the song titles and information about two collaborations for her 11th era, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" an album she announced after winning her 13th career Grammy on Sunday.\n\nThere are four sides to the album, according to a post on Swift's Instagram account.

As a poetic hat tip to the end of the relationship, Swift changed her opening \"Folklore\" song during the Eras Tour from \"Invisible String\" to \"The 1.\"\n\nSwift also said she wrote \"You're Losing Me,\" a bonus track on her \"Midnights\" album, two years ago. The track is about a relationship on life support, with Swift pleading with a lover to \"do something, babe, say something\" and bring the romance back to life.\n\nAt first glance, there are many nods in the \"Tortured Poets Department\" track list to London and England, where Alwyn is from. It seems the flirtatious nature of the pop bop \"London Boy\" has turned dark with this album's titles \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" \"So Long, London,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)\" and \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived.\"\n\n\"Fortnite\" may be a popular video game, but Swift's track \"Fortnight\" is in reference to a unit of time equal to two weeks or 14 days.\n\n\"loml\" is an acronym for \"love of my life.\"\n\n\"Clara Bow\" was an American actress, most famous for silent films.

The case wove it’s way through the legal system for years.\n\nTwo years ago, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a jury verdict that found that “Stairway to Heaven” had not been lifted from “Taurus.”\n\n“There are zillions and zillions of songs that are carrying the same chord progression, so it was very unfortunate, and it was unpleasant for everybody,” Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant said in 2021 during an appearance on BBC Radio 4’s “Loose Ends.”\n\nRobin Thicke’s ‘Blurred Lines’ featuring Pharrell Williams and T.I.\n\nPharrell Williams and Robin Thicke.

The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, plus Bowie and members of Queen received songwriting credit.\n\nBowie died in 2016 at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer.\n\nBiz Markie’s ‘Alone Again’\n\nBiz Markie in 2017.

It’s a name that some newer fans heard for the first time when the album “Red (Taylor’s Version)” was released with Track 21, “Ronan,” in 2021. It’s the name of a 3-year-old boy who died days before his fourth birthday in May 2011 after a nine-month battle with Stage 4 neuroblastoma.\n\nA decade ago, Swift wrote and sang this ballad about Maya and Ronan’s special relationship and its tragic end during a Stand Up to Cancer program in September 2012. She has only performed it twice, and the second time was a surprise for Thompson during Swift's 1989 Tour show in Glendale in 2015.\n\nSwift and Thompson’s relationship was born “because of the worst possible reason,” Thompson told The Arizona Republic. But Swift “took so much of my pain and turned it into the most beautiful thing,” as she wrote in an Instagram post after last seeing Swift perform in May 2018.\n\nThis “Ronan/Taylor magic … seems to appear during the times in my life that feel extra hard,” Thompson wrote.\n\nLove story:Why Taylor Swift launching her tour at State Farm Stadium is a big deal for Glendale\n\nHow the Ronan/Taylor magic began\n\nSwift never met Ronan, but she knew him from Thompson’s hundreds of blog posts on her website, Rockstar Ronan.\n\nThere, Thompson shared details of Ronan’s doctor’s visits, chemotherapy treatments, surgeries, radiation therapy and scans, interspersed with her raw innermost thoughts and fears and updates on her family and friends.\n\nThompson continued running Rockstar Ronan after he died, and she used the space to share her depression and grief with her readers. Oftentimes she wrote directly to Ronan.\n\nLittle did she know, Swift was reading the blog “every night,” as the singer said during her 1989 Tour stop in Glendale in 2015.\n\nThe two met in October 2011, when the Thompsons and their sons — as well as their guests, another Phoenix family whose child was going through Stage 4 cancer treatment — were invited to Swift’s Speak Now Tour and met the singer.\n\nSwift City, AZ:Glendale rebrands in honor of Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour launch\n\nThe story behind Taylor Swift’s song, ‘Ronan’\n\nA year later, Swift called Thompson out of the blue and left a voicemail.\n\n“I wrote a song for Ronan,” Swift told Thompson, according to Thompson’s Sept. 9, 2012, blog post.\n\nThe ballad charity single was titled “Ronan,” and its lyrics were inspired by Thompson’s writings. Thompson, who was credited as a co-writer, heard the song for the first time alongside the rest of the world when Swift debuted it during a Stand Up to Cancer program on Sept. 7, 2012.\n\nWhen Swift re-recorded her 2012 album, “Red,” with her new music label, Republic Records — a partnership that allows her to fully own her music — she reached out to Thompson again about the song.\n\nThis time Swift “wanted to give him a permanent home,” Thompson said.\n\n“I’ve recently completed the re-recording of my 4th album, ‘Red’. It’s really exceeded my expectations in so many ways, and one of those ways is that I thought it would be appropriate to add ‘Ronan’ to this album,” Swift wrote in the email, per Thompson’s July 2021 blog post.\n\n“I wrote Ronan while I was making ‘Red’ and discovered your story as you so honestly and devastatingly told it. My genuine hope is that you’ll agree with me that this song should be included on this album.”\n\nThe email continued, “As my co-writer and the rightful owner of this story in its entirety, your opinion and approval of this idea really matters to me, and I’ll honor your wishes here.”\n\n“That was very unexpected. I honestly was not expecting her to do that,” Thompson told The Republic.\n\n\"Taylor is the only one I would ever want (Ronan) to be left to\"\n\nShe described having “sleepless nights” when the master rights for Swift’s first six albums, which were owned by her record label, Big Machine Records, were sold to record executive Scooter Braun when he acquired the label in 2019. He then sold her masters to a private equity firm in 2020 but continued to profit from the recordings. Swift was not satisfied with the terms of a potential equity partnership and rejected the offer.\n\n“Ronan” was among the songs whose masters were sold. Swift retained the publishing rights for her older music and vowed to re-record every song so she would have full ownership.\n\n“When everything happened with (Swift), I was, one, so worried for her,” Thompson said. “But also, I was like, OK, somebody else pretty much, like, owns my son now, which was very upsetting to me because that was disturbing on so many levels.\n\n“Taylor is, like, the only one I would ever want him to be left to, in the hands of her. Not some greedy men,” she said. “She knew how upset I was and wanted to make sure that he would always be in good hands with her.”\n\nWhen “Red (Taylor’s Version)” was released on Nov. 12, 2021, “Ronan” went from charity single to an official album track.\n\n“Taylor has anchored you to this world so you will never be lost, and now she has ensured you will forever be safe in a new, permanent home,” Thompson wrote in her July 2021 blog post. \"She is once again giving a voice to the often voiceless, bereaved parents of the world as well as childhood cancer which deserves so much more funding than it gets.”\n\nBejeweled boots, mirrorballs:Here are Taylor Swift fans' best Eras Tour outfits\n\nTaylor made sure to sing ‘Ronan’ live for his mom\n\nIt’s times like when the Thompsons were at a Reputation show hours before the seventh anniversary of Ronan’s death that what Thompson calls the “Ronan/Taylor magic” is apparent.\n\nShe still gets goosebumps when she thinks of the first time she heard “Ronan” performed live on that August day in 2015.\n\nSwift introduced the song while strumming a guitar and revealed that she felt more of a kinship with Thompson since her own mother’s cancer diagnosis.\n\n“One of the bravest things a human being can ever do is to go through something absolutely unbearable and then share their experience with the world. There’s a woman tonight here named Maya Thompson, and she has lived in this area and brought her kids up in this area, and I wouldn’t know half as much as I know about childhood cancer and childhood cancer research if she hadn’t shared her story about her son, Ronan,” Swift said.\n\n“She had this blog called Rockstar Ronan, and I would read it every night. And it was this account about what it’s like to watch cancer take over your life, and since then I’ve had cancer hit really close to me and my family. So because Maya is right there I would like for you to give her a round of applause, please.”\n\nSwift wanted to “try to play this song. I can’t promise that I will sing it well or not get really emotional,” she said.\n\n“But I’m going to try because the only other time I played this was on a show called Stand Up to Cancer, and I think that because Maya’s here tonight I think she deserves it because co-wrote it for me.”\n\nTaylor Swift albums in order:Here are all her eras from 'Taylor Swift' to 'Midnights'\n\nHearing ‘Ronan’ performed live was \"one of the purest, most magical moments of my life\"\n\nIn her blog post about the experience, Thompson described feeling Ronan’s spirit through Swift’s performance.\n\n“I felt like I had the softest, safest blanket wrapped about me which can only be explained as being you. I felt you everywhere. I swear I felt your little hand inside of mine as Taylor’s angelic voice started to sing your song,” she wrote in August 2015. “I could literally feel your little arms wrapped around me. I have not felt your presence so close to me since you were physically still here on this earth. It was absolutely one of the purest, most magical moments of my life.”\n\nSome people have raised the possibility of Swift performing \"Ronan\" at her Glendale Eras Tour shows. Thompson says she is fine either way.\n\n“I feel like that was a once in a lifetime thing. And I'm so OK with that because it completely changed the dynamic and energy of the concert in, like, the most beautiful way. But it was also very tough,” she told The Republic. “Of course, if she wants to, I'm open to that. But also if she doesn't, I'm not taking that personally at all.”\n\n\"Ronan and Taylor are kind of like the magic behind it\"\n\nThat seems to be Thompson’s philosophy toward her relationship with Swift: Anything that results from it is organic.\n\n“When she comes for her concerts, you know, I don't expect to be invited. It just happens naturally and organically, which is really important to me,” Thompson said. “But it also is very important to me that I feel like Ronan and Taylor are kind of like the magic behind it. I never want to force anything.”\n\nThough Thompson doesn’t “ever expect, like, anything from (Swift),” time and again she and her family — ex-husband Woody, daughter Poppy and twin sons Quinn and Liam — have been invited whenever the singer performs in the Phoenix area. They have gone to every tour since “Speak Now,” and to see each photo that the Thompsons take with Swift is to witness their three children growing up.\n\nIn fact, Swift has known their youngest, Poppy Ronan Thompson, since before the 9-year-old was born. They first met backstage during the Glendale show on her Red Tour in May 2013, when Poppy was a little over a month old — at this time, Thompson blogged that she felt like Swift was “a part of our family now.”\n\nHow Taylor Swift influenced Ronan’s younger sister’s name\n\nPoppy and Swift’s connection began while Maya Thompson was pregnant.\n\n“Taylor's the one that actually named Poppy,” Thompson said. “I was, like, six months pregnant, and I was in New York, and I saw Taylor there, and I was like, 'What am I going to name this little girl?'”\n\nShe continued, “And (Swift) was like, 'What do you mean? You have to name her Poppy!' She was like, 'You started calling her that. I know it's just her nickname, but it cannot be just her nickname. You have to actually name her that.'”\n\nA decade later, Poppy “has definitely evolved into quite the Swiftie,” Thompson said.\n\n“I don't know who's more excited over here, me or my daughter,” she said about the March 17-18 Eras Tour shows. “I think Poppy was, like, four the last time we saw Taylor … at the Rep Tour. So I mean, she loved Taylor back then, but now it's like a full-fledged, just, it's on another level over here now.\n\nThese days, Thompson continues to fundraise for clinical trials through the Ronan Thompson Foundation and works in partnership with the New York-based nonprofit Solving Kids' Cancer. She is also almost finished with her first book. The family received their invitation to attend both Eras Tour Glendale shows a few weeks ago, and they are as excited as any other fan to see Swift perform again after five years.\n\nThompson is excited to finally see songs from the “Lover” album performed live and is holding out hope that “Death By A Thousand Cuts” made it on the tour’s set list. There’s also a special guest that she’s wishing for this time.\n\n“I'm really going to put it out there that I'm hoping Stevie Nicks might make an appearance,” Thompson said of the Phoenix-born singer. “That would be the most beautiful collaboration.”\n\nReach the reporter at kimi.robinson@gannett.com.

But that line-up can still get you “what was the deal with all new music?”\n\nNow that football season is over, it’s interesting to look back over the phenomenon that is Taylor Swift, whose fortunes became entwined with the Kansas City Chiefs. Her relationship with a player (Travis Kelce already famous in his own narrower right) got her into a skybox with his mom, and being even more famous, she was shown in TV coverage on occasion. Football fans began to erupt on social media over how much Taylor Swift was displacing the old fashioned NFL football coverage. “Too much of the female singer! We’re here for football!”\n\nBut ESPN personality Colin Cowherd put some interns to work clocking Swift on screen time, and found that on average viewers saw her for . . . 24 seconds out of three and a half hours of coverage. That’s 12,600 seconds total, so she was seen 0.2% of the time.\n\nSuper Bowl sightings of Taylor Swift: 55 seconds (51 seconds before the score that ended the game) out of a broadcast that was four hours and 18 minutes long. This is counting her sightings from kickoff until the game coverage ended. That’s 15,480 total seconds, so she was on screen more, to be fair: 0.35% of the game coverage.\n\nOh, and something I’m sure the NFL knows: their viewership is already 46% female. I’m not saying all women like Taylor Swift, nor that all men do not, but I think there’s a very rational justification for showing a bit of successful, famous women cheering on their teams during game broadcasts. Men who expect things to stay the way they’ve always been, with crowd shots mostly of former players and the stray (male) politician? Nope. Things aren’t changing: they’ve already changed.\n\nMarva Dawn was a very articulate theologian of worship and Christian practice, and her work took her into the middle of what was called for decades “the worship wars.” One of her often told stories was about a person who came up to her after church to complain about one of the hymns they just sang as being strange and unfamiliar. “It’s okay,” she told them. “It wasn’t really about you anyway.”\n\nIn fact, Dawn suggested it should worry us at least a little if we, long time church goers, love and are delighted by every last piece of music and verbiage we hear in worship. If it works SO well for us, she asked, then how is it working for newer, less familiar people coming to church for the first time, who are still working on their faith and understanding of who God is and what God is doing? Maybe it isn’t a good sign if we feel perfectly at home with all the service from beginning to end.\n\nOf course, can you have too much of a good thing? Perhaps. But when we think it’s “all” new and different, it may just be our expectations that were unfulfilled, and not God’s intention for the service.\n\nJeff Gill is a writer, storyteller, and preacher in central Ohio; he’s willing to admit he’s terrible at picking hymns for worship.

Workers with the Marine Resources Division are tending to thousands of larval flounder at a state hatchery in Gulf Shores, according to a news release from the agency. They hope to get between 1,000 and 5,000 fish from the hatchery in the first year, with a goal of releasing about 60,000 fish annually in a few years. Those fish would help add to a population of southern flounder that’s been falling since 2008. Scientists aren’t sure what is causing the decline. The state decreased bag limits for the fish this year and closed the season for the whole month of November to protect the flounder that were migrating through coastal bays on their way to winter spawning grounds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The oldest son of President Donald Trump has received a permit to hunt and kill a grizzly bear in the state, officials said Monday. Donald Trump Jr. was granted the permit to hunt north and east of Nome later this year, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. The governor has a limited number of “dignitary” licenses and game tags that he can hand out, Fish and Game spokesman Rick Green said. Trump Jr. did not receive one. He instead applied for one of 27 licenses designated for out-of-state hunters in the area. Only two other hunters applied. Officials said permits near Nome likely are not in demand for a variety of reasons, including the remoteness of the area and the expense to get there. As an out-of-state resident, Trump Jr. must be accompanied by a licensed Alaska guide for his hunt.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Republicans in the state Senate have given initial approval to a measure that would ask voters to limit the population differences among Arizona’s 30 legislative districts, over opposition from Democrats. The measure by Sen. J.D. Mesnard would require the state’s redistricting commission to create districts with a maximum difference of 5,000 people. Currently, a 10% difference is considered constitutional, meaning districts can vary by about 20,000 people. Democrats argued the change would greatly affect the ability of tribes and minority communities to elect representatives of their choice. They also said putting in hard rules like Mesnard proposes minimizes other factors the state’s Independent Redistricting Commission is required to consider, including keeping communities of interest together if possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nEureka Springs: A cemetery will continue allowing individuals or groups to place Confederate flags on grave markers unless a family member of the deceased objects, despite complaints the flag is a racist symbol. Eureka Springs’ cemetery commission approved an amendment earlier this month also requiring anyone wanting to place flags or plaques to get permission from the cemetery superintendent, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Glenna Booth, a member of the commission, said the amendment was her idea. “I just tried to come up with something that would be fair to everyone,” Booth said. Gloria Stevens, sexton at the cemetery, said there are about 47 Confederate veterans and 97 Union veterans among the 4,600 burials there. She said the cemetery was established in 1889, so none of those veterans died during the Civil War.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In their latest bid to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis, lawmakers on Monday announced a package of bills to limit development fees that can add tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a new home. However, local governments depend heavily on the fees, which typically are used to pay for schools, roads and parks. Lawmakers said they were discussing those needs but have not yet decided how the fees might be replaced. The fees are “vital to local government’s ability to pay for the infrastructure that residents living in new developments need,” Chris Lee, legislative representative for the California State Association of Counties, said in a statement. Development-related fees, also known as impact fees, can provide up to a third of some cities’ budgets, according to a report last year by the University of California, Berkeley, Terner Center for Housing Innovation.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Thousands of 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential primary for the first time under a new state law. The law allows 17-year-olds to cast ballots in spring primaries if they turn 18 before November’s general election. At least seven states and Washington, D.C., have similar laws. According to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office, about 24,000 teens are eligible to vote in the March 3 primary under the change, a small number in a state with 3.4 million voters, the Sentinel Colorado reports. Three Overland High School students who were interviewed about the new law said they did not know about their ability to vote until a few weeks ago and figure most of their peers were not aware either.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state legislative committee voted Monday to advance a bill that would eliminate the state’s religious exemption for certain childhood vaccines, despite vocal opposition from hundreds of parents and children who packed the Connecticut Capitol complex in hopes of persuading lawmakers to defeat it. The legislation narrowly cleared the General Assembly’s Public Health Committee by a vote of 14-11, prompting chants of “we will remember in November” after the tally was announced. Some opponents of the bill booed and shouted at the legislators who had voted for the measure as they left the hearing room and tried to get into elevators to their offices. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the bill, which now awaits further action in the House of Representatives. It’s considered one of the most contentious issues of the three-month legislative session, fueling concerns about the safety of vaccines and the curtailment of parental and religious rights.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has rejected a challenge by state environmental officials to rules issued by utility regulators regarding renewable energy requirements. The judge on Monday ruled that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has no standing to challenge regulations issued by the Public Service Commission. Superior Court Judge Ferris Wharton agreed with the commission and the state Division of the Public Advocate that DNREC had no standing to sue because it was neither a “person” nor “aggrieved” under Delaware’s Administrative Procedures Act. Environmental secretary Shawn Garvin did not respond to an email seeking comment, but a spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision and will discuss its options. The ruling is the latest development in a long-running legal dispute over which state agency has authority to develop regulations regarding how minimum renewable energy purchase requirements can be frozen if they become too costly for ratepayers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man who was injured while assembling a construction crane was safely rescued from a high angle in D.C. The man, who wasn’t identified, suffered a serious injury to his leg Saturday while working on the crane about 230 feet off the ground, news outlets report. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services used a second crane to reach the man and provide initial treatment. He was then placed in a basket and lowered to the ground, according to videos shared by the department. The worker was taken to the hospital for an injury not considered life-threatening.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Promising to be a worldwide first, a new Southwest Florida marina could set the standard for future boat storage. Set to open in April on Fort Myers Beach, Gulf Star Marina is being branded as the “world’s first SMART Marina” due to using its ASAR, or automated, storage and retrieval system. “The entire world is watching,” said Todd Carroll, one of the marina’s owners and president of Carroll Properties. “We believe it has the ability to change the way we store boats. It’s just a much better way.” The technology was developed by Austria-based LTW Intralogistics, which has been creating automated systems for warehouses used by companies like IKEA for decades, Carroll said. But it’s never been done in a marina before, according to Carroll. The railed system ditches the diesel-powered forklift often used in dry storage facilities and replaces it with an automated, electric-powered storage crane and shuttles.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State senators have approved a measure that would increase the fee for dumping coal ash in Georgia. The Senate passed Senate Bill 123 on Monday by a vote of 52-2, sending it to the House for more work. The measure would raise the fee for dumping coal ash from $1 a ton to $2.50 a ton, equaling what it costs to dispose of other kinds of garbage at Georgia landfills. Lawmakers raised the fee for other garbage in 2018 but left the fee for coal ash at $1. Coal ash has become a flashpoint in the current General Assembly session and in the state at large. A 2018 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice found contaminated groundwater near 11 of 12 coal-fired power plants. The refuse contains heavy metals and other contaminates that can leach into groundwater. Near Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer in Juliette, environmentalists have been conducting tests that have found residents have contaminated well water.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A research report has predicted the state may be hit by the economic fallout of a new virus, negatively affecting the tourism industry. The University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization said the spread of COVID-19 could undermine previous predictions that 2020 would be a better year for tourism than 2019. The organization’s latest quarterly forecast on the state’s visitor industry released Monday said the virus that started in China has changed its previous calculation. “I think if it hadn’t been for this virus outbreak, it probably would have been better – mostly because the global economy was sort of repairing itself,” said Carl Bonham, the organization’s executive director. “Trade tensions had eased up a little bit. We were expecting some recovery in 2020, and now that hope has sort of been dashed.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Visitors to the state who are 18 and older and can legally possess firearms would be allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits under legislation that headed to the House on Monday. The House State Affairs Committee voted 11-3 to approve the bill brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. Republicans on the committee backed the measure, while all the Democrats voted against it. Idaho residents 18 and older are allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits in Idaho without a permit or training following a new law that went into place last summer. The legislation would extend that to any legal resident of the United States or a U.S. armed services member. Zito said the legislation is intended to clear up confusion. Opponents say allowing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon without any required training within city limits is a bad idea and could lead to shootings.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The sale of recreational marijuana in the state generated $7.3 million in cannabis tax revenue last month, the Department of Revenue announced Monday. The department also reported that an additional $3.1 million was generated in retail sales tax revenue. Dispensaries across the state sold nearly $40 million in recreational pot last month. Toi Hutchinson, an adviser to Gov. J.B. Pritzker on cannabis control, said the goal of Illinois’ legal cannabis industry is to build a socially equitable program to help communities most harmed by the nation’s war on drugs. “Revenue raised in this first month will soon begin flowing back into those communities to begin repairing the damage done by the failed policies of the past and creating new opportunities for those who have been left behind for far too long,” Hutchinson said.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at Grissom Air Reserve Base is seeking a $100,000 boost from local government toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders are asking for Miami County economic development fund money as they plan the estimated $700,000 exhibit space featuring the bomber, dozens of which were stationed at the Indiana base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber, and only seven remain out of the 116 built, the Kokomo Tribune reports. The museum has raised more than $100,000 toward the project and hopes to build a roof over the Hustler this year while continuing to raise money, museum Director Tom Jennings said. The project plans call for a display of artifacts about the bomber’s history and a loft area allowing visitors to look down on the plane. The Miami County Council could vote on the funding request next month.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is considering asking businesses seeking city tax incentives to also provide housing options if they employ low-income workers. It’s just one proposal for how the city could use its policies, zoning ordinances and financial incentives to ensure its mix of housing includes options that are affordable for its workforce. A workforce housing study released in May found central Iowa is short 57,179 new housing units for the region’s anticipated job growth in the next 20 years. Nearly half of those new workers would need housing priced below $175,000 for an owner-occupied home or below $1,250 a month for a rental. The Des Moines Area Association of Realtors reported in December that the median home price in its listings was $229,000, while CBRE/Hubbell Commercial, a brokerage that tracks the industry, said median rent across the metro is $935 a month. Downtown, it is $1,189 per month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators aren’t ready to declare that marijuana possession never should be a felony, rejecting proposals Monday to lower penalties for third-time offenders and to release others from prison. The House Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee voted 7-4 against a bill that would make possessing marijuana a misdemeanor, no matter how many times someone was convicted. Kansas law currently says a third conviction is a felony that can be punished by up to 14 months in prison, though offenders often receive probation. The bill also initially said offenders now in prison for marijuana possession would be released, but the committee removed that provision from the measure. Supporters of lessening the penalties for repeated marijuana possession accepted the change to give the bill a better chance of passing. Yet the measure failed to clear the GOP-controlled committee anyway.\n\nKentucky\n\nCold Spring: A Northern Kentucky city has become the third municipality in 2020 to adopt a Fairness Ordinance. The leaders of Cold Spring, near Cincinnati, voted 4-1 on Monday night in favor of protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and other accommodations. Cold Spring is the fifth city in Northern Kentucky over the past year to pass such an ordinance, according to the Fairness Campaign. It’s the 19th such community in the commonwealth. Councilman Adam Sandfoss, who introduced the ordinance, said in a statement that “I’m proud of our city’s vote for equal rights tonight. We want folks to know Cold Spring is a community everyone can call home, and I hope our action will inspire more Northern Kentucky communities – maybe even Campbell County – to adopt similar protections for all their residents.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new group focused on Mardi Gras-season parade safety will begin work late this week or early next week, the police chief said Monday in discussing the city’s response to the recent deaths of two people in float-related accidents. Suggestions from family members of the victims and others – such as setting up barricades along the entire length of the parade routes, rather than only at major intersections, and mounting accordion barriers between sections of tandem floats – will be discussed, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told a news conference. Ferguson noted that setting up barricades along parade routes that are 5 to 7 miles long would be time-consuming and require many workers. He also said additional workers would be need to be on hand to move such barricades out of the way for any emergency vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker is hoping to pass a bill he said would protect children in the state from unauthorized surveillance by drones. The proposal from Rep. John Andrews of Paris would create a new state law the legislator said in a statement would “prevent unauthorized drone spying on a person in their domicile where they have an expectation of privacy.” Andrews is asking the state’s Legislative Council to allow his proposal to go through despite the fact a legislation deadline has passed. He said the law would establish penalties for people convicted of surveilling underage children. The Legislative Council is expected to discuss whether to consider the proposal this session on Thursday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Workers would be able to take 12 weeks off work to care for a new child or an ill family member through a new state-administered insurance pool that would provide partial wage replacement, under legislation that received a hearing in a House committee Monday. The measure would create a fund supported by weekly employer and employee contributions. Each would contribute half, based on a sliding scale. An employee with the state’s average wage would contribute $3.62 a week, said Del. Kris Valderrama, a Democrat sponsoring the bill. “It is limited in its scope, but it will allow people a brief respite and help to make ends meet, at least temporarily,” Valderrama said. But opponents said it would create the potential for up to 24 weeks off in some circumstances. Opponents said while they were not fully opposed to the concept, the Maryland measure was too burdensome.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A local museum has received a gift of more than 1,600 photographic works it says will enhance what is already one of the leading collections of Asian photography in the U.S. and Europe. The gift to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem comes from the Joy of Giving Something Foundation, known for its work that explores the intersection of photography and social issues. The collection features the works of 123 artists, primarily of Chinese and Japanese descent or who worked in eastern Asia, from 1930 to the present day. The museum already has a roughly 5,000-piece collection of 19th-century photography. “These photographs deepen our museum’s 220-year relationship with East Asian culture and offer a compelling complement to our historic collection of Asian photography,” Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, the museum’s deputy director, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that the state will have a mobility officer to coordinate all initiatives related to self-driving and connected cars, an effort she said will ensure Michigan is the go-to place for testing and producing vehicles of the future. While speaking at the MICHAuto Summit in Detroit, Whitmer signed an executive directive to create the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, effectively immediately. It will be led by a chief mobility officer whose name probably will be announced in April, Whitmer said. She also signed an executive order to establish the Michigan Council on Future Mobility and Electrification, an advisory group that will replace but function similarly to one created by a 2016 law. The council will be housed within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity instead of the Department of Transportation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Law enforcement officers should get better training in de-escalation skills and in dealing with people experiencing mental health crises, a working group on reducing police-involved deadly force encounters recommended Monday. Minnesota’s two highest-ranking black law enforcement officials – Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington – formed the working group last summer in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police officers, including those of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. Minnesota has had more than 100 officer-involved shootings over the past five years, Harrington said, adding that many members were surprised to learn 60% happened outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, affecting nearly every county in the state. Ellison said the group also learned that between 30% and 50% of the people killed in encounters with police were having mental health crises.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A routine road closure for a transportation worker turned into the quick delivery of a baby on the interstate. Wayne Evans, a superintendent with the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was getting ready to shut down a lane Monday morning on I-20 near Brandon when a car pulled up with its emergency lights flashing, and two women got out of the vehicle. “They were in desperate need for something,” Evans said in an interview shared online by MDOT. When Evans approached the car, he found a third woman in labor in the backseat. “It was going to happen pretty quick, and I knew they weren’t gonna make it to the hospital,” he said. So Evans got a first aid kit from his truck, put on a pair of gloves and helped deliver the baby boy. “He put his gloves on and got his umbilical cord from around his neck, and he helped me deliver,” new mom Desire’e Thomas told WAPT-TV. Evans said he believes his Marine Corps training kicked in.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new effort in St. Louis County will make the overdose-reversing antidote naloxone more readily available to the public, in hopes of reducing the high number of opioid overdose deaths in the state’s largest county. Democratic County Executive Sam Page on Monday announced details of a program that will make naloxone available free of charge to community groups and the public during regular business hours at the county’s John C. Murphy Health Center in Berkeley. County officials said the site was chosen because of its location in north St. Louis County, the area hit hardest by the epidemic. U.S. health officials believe the increasing availability of naloxone, commonly known under the brand name Narcan, is partly responsible for the first drop in overdose deaths in nearly 30 years.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: An investigation has started after seven trumpeter swans were found dead at a pond near the city, wildlife officials said. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks received a report of dead swans between the towns of Belgrade and Manhattan on Friday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Biologists and wardens collected the animals’ bodies Saturday, department spokesman Morgan Jacobson said. “We still don’t have a cause of death,” Jacobson said, adding that the agency has not ruled out any causes including poaching or the swans eating moldy grain. Trumpeter swans are on the state’s species of concern list, according to Montana Field Guides’ website. The list helps resource managers make decisions about species conservation and data collection priorities. Trumpeter swans are the largest waterfowl in North America, experts said. They can be up to 5 feet (in length, have a wingspan up to about 7 feet and weigh over 20 pounds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has been chosen to lead a team of universities and other partners in studying counterterrorism and terrorism prevention, federal officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Monday that the university has won a $3.65 million-a-year grant for 10 years. The university will spearhead a consortium of academic, industry, government and laboratory partners in trying to find ways to prevent or counteract threats to the nation’s people, infrastructure and economy, the directorate said. That consortium constitutes what the directorate describes as a center of excellence. It will be the directorate’s 10th center of excellence, said directorate spokesman John Verrico.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: State officials issued another marijuana health advisory regarding products that were on shelves at 30 dispensaries in Nevada last month. The Nevada Department of Taxation issued an advisory late Friday concerning 20 products that failed microbial testing conducted by an independent lab. The products were sold in the form of raw cannabis buds and raw cannabis that had been pre-rolled into a joint. The products came from six different cultivators in Nevada and failed a variety of mold, yeast and bacteria testing. All of the products were initially tested and passed by Cannex LLC, a Las Vegas marijuana testing lab that the taxation department suspended in December as part of an investigation. The products were on the shelves between Oct. 25 and Jan. 16 at dispensaries across the state. There are no known reports of illness, according to the taxation officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers are working on a bill that would require more insurance coverage for people in the state who get tick-borne disease testing. Rep. Megan Murray, a first-term Democrat from Amherst, said her constituents have told her that doctors often prioritize testing for Lyme disease after a tick bite, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Murray’s bill, which has bipartisan co-sponsors, would require insurers to cover additional advanced, broad tests that could catch Lyme and other more rare diseases. Murray said she hopes that testing for these diseases earlier will prevent delayed diagnoses, as well as lower costs for patients and insurers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHoboken: The city, one of the areas in the state hit hardest by Superstorm Sandy, is making progress toward completing a large public park that will double as a reservoir for nearly 2 million gallons of storm water to prevent it from flooding city streets. On Monday, officials announced the awarding of a $14 million federal grant to continue construction of the 5-acre park, which sits in the northwest corner of the city on the former site of a chemical plant, about a mile from the Lincoln Tunnel into New York. The project has been under construction for about five months and is expected to be completed in late 2022. The park will feature green space, athletic fields, an ice skating rink and other amenities. A 30-foot-deep underground tank will hold up to a million gallons of water that normally would collect in city streets, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It was the 1970s when the state last increased the amount of bond money that oil and gas companies are required to put up before drilling. As development continues at a record pace, State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says it’s time to take another look. Legislation that called for a study of the issue stalled during the recent session, but Garcia Richard announced just a day after lawmakers adjourned that she’s moving forward with the effort. She said her office has the funding to begin the work. The review could take months. Given all the infrastructure and development on state trust lands, officials said the amount of bonding needed to ensure taxpayers aren’t left paying for any cleanup and restoration after oil, gas or other minerals are extracted is currently unknown. Garcia Richard described it as an urgent issue that could leave “taxpayers and our state trust land beneficiaries on the hook for potentially millions of dollars.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York State Police say they plan to go forward with a body camera pilot program for state troopers, a move that would change the agency’s status as one of the few primary state law enforcement agencies in the nation without body or dashboard cameras. Kevin Bruen, first deputy superintendent of the New York State Police, disclosed the plan for a pilot program Monday at the state Capitol. He did not provide details of the plan, such as how many troopers will receive the devices and how much money the pilot program might cost. Patrol cameras are regularly praised by law enforcement experts as ways to increase transparency and hold officers and citizens accountable. Equipping state police with body cameras has received support from New York Attorney General Letitia James. Some state lawmakers have also expressed support for bringing the technology to the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in 2016 to limit the power of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper before he could take office now want the state’s highest court to hear their case. Lawyers for Common Cause and ten citizens filed an appeal petition with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, about a month after the Court of Appeals upheld the legality of the three-day session in December 2016. Republicans in charge of the House and Senate approved a pair of measures during the session that weakened Cooper’s power as governor. Those who sued said the fleetness of GOP leaders calling the session and pushing through legislation violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to “instruct their representatives.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A city building dubbed Sandbag Central will soon be open for business as Fargo leaders prepare for spring flooding along the Red River, the city administrator said Monday night. Bruce Grubb told city commissioners of plans to fill 250,000 sandbags in order to protect the city to 41 feet, which would be 23 feet over flood stage. The latest outlook from the National Weather Service shows a 10% probability that the river will reach 39 feet in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area. KFGO radio reports Grubb called the chance of a severe flood “a flip of the coin” and said the city would rather “err on the side of caution.” Volunteers filled hundreds of thousands of sandbags last year for anticipated flooding that never materialized. Sandbag Central is located in a building that is normally a parking garage for garbage trucks. Plans are to begin sandbag operations March 10.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: Two cheetah cubs have been born through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer to a surrogate mother for the first time, zoo officials announced Monday. The male and female cubs were born to 3-year-old Izzy at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium on Wednesday, the zoo said in a statement. A team observed the births through a remote camera and is continuing to monitor Izzy and the cubs. The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi, who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally. Kibibi’s eggs were extracted and then fertilized in a Columbus Zoo laboratory Nov. 19. The early-stage embryos were implanted into Izzy on Nov. 21, and an ultrasound revealed she was pregnant with two fetuses about a month later. Dr. Randy Junge, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, said this development could have broader implications for managing the species’ population in the future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Children under the age of 17 would be required to wear seat belts in vehicle back seats under a bill narrowly passed Monday by the state Senate. The bill, which passed on a 25-22 vote, changes current law that requires only children younger than age 8 to wear seat belts in the back seat. “The bottom line is children are being hurt and dying simply because we don’t require them to wear a seat belt,” said Sen. Roland Pederson, a Burlington Republican. Pederson said Oklahoma is the nation’s only state that does not require seat belts for children older than age 8. The measure now heads to the House, where a similar bill is pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: House Republicans walked out from the state Capitol on Tuesday, joining their Senate colleagues in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill. “Oregon House Republicans are taking a stand, with working families, in opposing cap and trade and this rigged process,” House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, said in a statement. House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she has and will continue to make an effort toward compromise, but that isn’t possible if Republicans are not in the Capitol. In a stream of statements released Tuesday morning, House Republicans cited the process of crafting Senate Bill 1530, as well as the policy itself, as their reasons for leaving. Republicans have said SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say that cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state’s carbon emissions and that the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An inmate awaiting trial in a shooting case wants a federal judge to release him from solitary confinement in a central Pennsylvania county jail, where he has been confined for more than a year because he refuses to cut dreadlocks that hold religious significance for him. The hand-written lawsuit filed in October by Eric S. McGill Jr. against three senior administrators at the Lebanon County Correctional Facility shifted gears last week, when a set of lawyers produced an amended complaint that warned McGill’s mental health is deteriorating. It said McGill, 27, of Lebanon, an adherent of Rastafarianism, suffers anxiety attacks two or three times a week, and they are usually triggered by thoughts of his jail conditions and placement in solitary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two state lawmakers are proposing to raise taxes on residents earning more than $500,000 annually to pay for education. Democratic state Sen. Ryan Pearson, of Cumberland, and Democratic Rep. Gregg Amore, of East Providence, are proposing a new tax bracket for income earned higher than $500,000. It would add 1 percentage point to the 5.99% top rate, with incremental revenue directed to an account for funding education from kindergarten through grade 12, they said. They emphasized that their proposal would not affect any resident earning less than $500,000 annually. Amore said the state needs a commitment of resources to pay for reforms to the education system. Pearson said that by asking the top 1% of earners in Rhode Island to contribute more, there will be funding to ensure that all Rhode Islanders can get a good education.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An April performance by the Hong Kong Ballet at the Peace Center has been canceled due to concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. The ballet was set to perform “ALICE (in wonderland)” on April 21 with the help of dozens of local ballet students. The company postponed its upcoming U.S. tour due to the virus. Hong Kong Ballet Artistic Director Septime Webre said the group is putting the health and safety of its dancers and the general public first but is committed to returning to South Carolina in the coming seasons. Auditions were held in late January to choose local ballet students to fill roles in the show, and rehearsals had already begun. Anyone who’s already purchased tickets will automatically receive a refund based on their method of payment, according to a release from the Peace Center.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a proposal to stop schools from requiring students to get vaccinations. A House committee heard emotional testimony from parents on both sides of the issue but decided to effectively kill the bill, saying it would have resulted in decreased vaccination rates and could have caused outbreaks in vaccine-preventable diseases. Supporters of the bill said South Dakota is the first state Legislature this year to consider a proposal to end school vaccine requirements, but the issue is now being carried by lawmakers in a few other states. They hoped that despite the bill’s defeat, their doubts about vaccinations would gain credence in the state. Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the bill and told reporters last week that vaccinations have saved millions of lives. Doctors, as well as lobbyists from medical groups, hospitals, business groups, universities and schools, also lined up to testify against the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state on Monday set two new execution dates, days after putting to death its seventh inmate in the past year and a half. The Tennessee Supreme Court ordered an Oct. 8 execution date for Byron Black and a Dec. 3 execution date for Pervis Payne. Black was convicted by a Nashville court of murdering his girlfriend Angela Clay and her daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6, at their home in 1988. Prosecutors said he shot the three during a jealous rage. Black was on work release at the time for shooting and wounding Clay’s estranged husband. Payne was sentenced to death in Memphis for the 1987 fatal stabbing of Charisse Christopher and her daughter, Lacie Jo, in what prosecutors described as a “drug-induced frenzy.” Christopher’s son, Nicholas, who was 3 at the time, was stabbed but survived. Attorneys for the inmates have argued that both men are intellectually disabled and mentally ill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: This week the state Department of Transportation could approve a request from Gov. Greg Abbott to rent a state-owned temporary campsite for the homeless to an Austin nonprofit. But the residents have another idea: They want the governor to lease the property directly to them. In an open letter to Abbott, those who have taken shelter at the campsite they are calling Camp R.A.T.T., which stands for Responsible Adult Transition Town, said they would be willing to pay $1 a month per resident to rent the land. Abbott is offering a $1-a-month lease to ATX Helps, a nonprofit tied to the Austin Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Austin Alliance. “We believe this is a good idea for several reasons: it gives the residents here a sense of responsibility, and provides the basis of stewardship,” the letter said. “Also, we aren’t lazy and aren’t expecting a hand-out. It’s our intention to get back into the world.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Most abortions would be banned in the state under a new proposal at the Legislature – one that abortion-rights advocates say would create fear and uncertainty even though it wouldn’t be enforced unless the legal landscape changes. The proposal would make it a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison to perform an abortion except in cases of rape, incest or serious threat to the health of the mother. The bill contains a so-called trigger clause, so the measure wouldn’t go into effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion in the country. The trigger clause also means it likely could not be immediately challenged in court. Utah passed a ban after 18 weeks last year, and lawmakers are considering additional abortion-related proposal this year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a bill that would increase the minimum wage. The vote was 100 to 49. The Senate, which has a Democrat majority, voted 24-6 in favor of the veto override earlier this month. The original bill did not pass the Democrat-led House with the two-thirds margin that would be needed to override the governor’s veto, but some lawmakers changed their votes Tuesday. Scott has said that raising the minimum wage to $12.55 by 2022 could end up hurting the people it is intended to help.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A judge has hit the pause button on the city’s plans to remove a 175-year-old slave auction block from a downtown street corner. The Free Lance-Star reports Circuit Court Judge Sarah Deneke has agreed to a 15-day stay of her order to remove the block in Fredericksburg. Her order allows a business owner who is challenging the removal to ask the Virginia Supreme Court to take on the case. E.D. Cole Building LLC owns a commercial building across the street from the auction block. The firm and the owner of a nearby restaurant have argued that they’ll lose business from tourist traffic if the auction block is removed. The judge already ruled that city officials have the authority to approve the removal the block. The city had previously placed traffic cones around the block with plans to move it before the business owner urged the court to stop the city.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Weekly benefits under the state’s new paid family leave law are now taking up to 10 weeks to process because of the high number of people applying for the program. Under the law, eligible workers receive 12 weeks’ paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious medical condition of the worker or the worker’s family member, or 16 weeks for a combination of both. An additional two weeks may be used if there is a serious health condition with a pregnancy. Weekly benefits under the new law are calculated based on a percentage of the employee’s wages and the state’s weekly average wage – which is now $1,255 – though the weekly amount paid out is capped at $1,000. In the first six weeks since the program went live last month, more than 30,000 people have applied, more than triple the amount that was projected in that same time frame, according to the Washington Employment Security Department.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican state lawmakers moved forward Monday on a sweeping tax overhaul that could slash county government budgets, though it appears likely Democrats may derail the plan. Senators voted 17-16 to pass a GOP proposal to cut taxes on manufacturers and personal vehicles while raising sales taxes and taxes on tobacco products. But still looming is an accompanying resolution, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, to set the plan in motion. “This is a bad plan; it’s going to hurt West Virginians,” said Sen. Mike Romano, a Democrat from Harrison County. Many county leaders oppose the tax overhaul and worry it could result in the loss of millions of dollars in tax revenues that play an integral part of their budgets. Jonathan Adler, executive director of the West Virginia Association of Counties, said the plan raised the potential for devastating cuts to local law enforcement and courts.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Authorities say three people died in snowmobile accidents last weekend, boosting the number of deaths to 17 for the season. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said all three of the victims were from Illinois. Two of them died after striking trees, and one person was killed after being struck by another snowmobile rider. There have been nine fatalities this month. That includes a 15-year-old Wisconsin boy who failed to stop at an intersection of a public trail and highway and collided with a car, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who struck a fence on private land and a 29-year-old woman who struck several trees. Alcohol, excess speed and driver inexperience are the leading causes of snowmobile accidents, according to the DNR.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The National Park Service is about to begin facility and trail work totaling almost $4 million in Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming. The work will include making an overlook trail more accessible to people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations. Plans also call for improving access to restrooms, a visitor center and a trail to the base of Devils Tower. Parking lots, visitor center exhibits and trail signs also will see improvements. Funding will come from a variety of sources including a portion of entrance fees, the Gillette News-Record reports. “It’s been a long time planned and a long time coming to make sure that all these funding sources came together for us,” said Nick Myers, the national monument’s chief of interpretation. Work is expected to begin this week, weather permitting, and should be done by November, Myers said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/26"}]}

Everything you think you ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor years I believed a lot of what I heard about millennials – those avocado-toast eating, latte-guzzling, selfie-taking narcissists who still live in their parents’ basements and can’t get their lives together.\n\nThen I realized something that surprised me: I’m a millennial, as are many of the people I know and love.\n\nI’d long assumed my friends and classmates were older and wiser than this much-maligned group. But when I started covering demographics for CNN, I learned that 1981 is the birth year many researchers identify as the beginning of the millennial generation.\n\nI was born in 1982. And this year, I turned 40. So did millions of other millennials in the United States.\n\nThat’s right: The generation long portrayed as young and naïve is entering middle age.\n\nIt’s a notable milestone, and a good opportunity to point out something important: the Myth of the Millennial is very different from the reality many of us are living.\n\nMyth 1: We only think about ourselves\n\nBack in May, my husband went out of town on a trip, and I was solo parenting our infant daughter for the first time. “I can do this,” I thought, trying to reassure myself. “It won’t be that hard.” Then one night, my daughter’s first two teeth started to poke through her gums. After watching on the baby monitor as she thrashed in her crib for what probably was only a few minutes, but seemed like an eternity, I ended up holding her in my arms for the rest of the night to comfort her.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nIn the scheme of tough things new parents can go through, this was nothing major. But I was exhausted. And so was she.\n\nAs the sun rose, we sat bleary-eyed on the floor of her room together. Her pajamas were covered with the cherry-flavored Children’s Tylenol she’d spit out when I tried to give it to her the night before. But for a few minutes that morning, we were playing and she was smiling and it seemed like we’d made it through a marathon and finally could relax.\n\nThen my phone rang with devastating, unexpected news.\n\nMy mom had died that morning.\n\nI was shaken, stunned and sobbing. I looked at my daughter playing beside me. There were so many questions I wish I’d asked my mom about how to take care of her. Instead of calling my mom that day to ask for advice, I would race to Michigan to help plan her funeral.\n\nSuddenly, the same year I became a mother had become the year when I lost a mother, too.\n\nIt was less than two months before my 40th birthday.\n\nMillennials famously appeared on the cover of TIME magazine nearly a decade ago beneath the headline, “THE ME ME ME GENERATION,” cementing our self-obsessed image.\n\nThis Time cover from 2013 reinforced stereotypes about millennials as entitled and self-absorbed. From TIME\n\nBut for me and many others, what it really means to be a millennial these days is something quite different. We are the newest sandwich generation, feeling growing pressure between raising young children and caring for aging family members – or at least wanting to care for them, given all they’ve done to care for us, but struggling to know what to do.\n\nMillennials like me are too busy juggling our responsibilities at work and caring for others at home to be as self-obsessed as we’ve been portrayed all these years.\n\nLike every generation before us, we’re growing up. But the Myth of the Millennial has long been off the mark.\n\nFor years, for example, headlines have blared that millennials aren’t having kids. The reality, though, is more complicated, according to Kim Parker, director of social trends research at the Pew Research Center.\n\n“Women are having children later. But when we look at completed fertility, we haven’t seen that they’re necessarily having fewer children, just starting later,” Parker says. “It represents a lag, not necessarily a completely different way in approaching family life.”\n\nJason Dorsey, who’s written several books about millennials and made a career out of helping Corporate America better understand them, says the memes about selfish millennials simply don’t match up with reality.\n\n“The oldest millennials tell us they’re being pulled in three different directions,” says Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics. “They’re often taking care of a child or children. They’re frequently taking care of a parent or parents. And they’re trying to navigate their jobs. And so that pull, there’s a lot going on there, and it’s a very stressful time.”\n\nMy husband captured this moment on my 40th birthday this year, as I fed my daughter while we watched July 4 fireworks. Caring for her has changed the way I look at my life. Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nPast generations have entered this life stage, too, Dorsey says. But this time around, one thing is different.\n\n“What’s new is to do it at 40 years old,” he says, “with so many people having very young children.”\n\nMany middle-aged millennials like me are feeling this pressure even in our most joyous moments. And Dorsey says there’s plenty of research to be done still about how this shift is changing our society.\n\nHow will this shape the kind of parents we become, or the way we approach our jobs, or the choices we make in other parts of our lives?\n\nMyth 2: We all share the same experiences\n\nIt’s not necessarily surprising that for years I didn’t realize I was one of the more than 72 million millennials in the United States.\n\nSome experts argue that analyzing our society using generation labels is just about as reliable and scientific as using your horoscope.\n\nThey contend that many more factors can shape someone’s life than the year they were born – race and socioeconomic status, for example. And when you label and analyze a whole group of people without digging much into those details, important nuances about social change end up getting lost.\n\n“Drawing arbitrary lines between birth years and slapping names on them isn’t helping,” Philip N. Cohen wrote last year in a Washington Post opinion piece. The professor of sociology at the University of Maryland has been leading a group of academics pushing for the Pew Research Center and others to stop promoting generational labels altogether.\n\nAvocado toast has become an increasingly popular restaurant offering and a symbol of millennial culture. Adobe Stock\n\nI can see their point.\n\nSome of my younger millennial friends, who are in their late 20s, have looked at me wide-eyed when I talk about the videotapes I watched growing up, or what it was like hearing that delightful, high-pitched, staticky tone that meant your home computer was oh-so-slowly connecting to the internet via dial-up. Major events that shaped our world happened at very different points in our lives. I was in college on 9/11; they were in elementary school. I was in grad school and looking for work during the Great Recession; they were still living with their parents.\n\nSome argue that the split between us is so big that older millennials like me should actually get our own category (sometimes combined with younger members of Generation X). Our so-called micro-generation has been dubbed the Xennials, the Oregon Trail Generation, and – most recently, and controversially – Geriatric Millennials.\n\n“It’s important not to label those within a 20-year span as being the same,” says Erica Dhawan, a researcher, author and consultant who coined the “Geriatric Millennial” term in a piece for Medium last year. Like me, she says she just never felt like the millennial label suited her.\n\nAll the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media. Lindsey Pollak, author and consultant\n\nTo make things even more confusing, there’s no concrete definition of when the millennial generation begins and ends. The 1991 book credited with introducing the term states that millennials were born in 1982. Widely cited definitions on the Pew Research Center’s website describe millennials as those born between 1981 and 1996. Other researchers have floated theories that millennials were born in the late 1970s and even up to the early 2000s.\n\nThe way we talk about groups of people born in any given period – and the names we use to describe them – can change over time. “Gen Y” used to be a more common way to label our generation, before “millennials” gained momentum.\n\nNo matter what name or definition you use, there’s a sizable age gap between the older and younger members of our generation, and a wide range of life experiences we’ve all had.\n\nCan there still be value in looking at things this way?\n\n“It’s a useful lens, but it’s not the only one,” says Parker of the Pew Research Center, “and it’s important to take into account all the other factors that are causing these differences rather than just being part of a generation.”\n\nNow that I know I’m a millennial, I’m not ready to give up the label just yet. But I do want to help set the record straight and shed these persistent stereotypes about our generation (full disclosure: I do love avocado toast).\n\nMyth 3: We don’t want to own homes\n\nThe question haunts my husband and I – popping up in conversations with friends, loved ones and even strangers.\n\n“Are you thinking of buying a house?”\n\nFor years that milestone didn’t matter much to either of us. We’ve house-sat, and rented, and focused our energy and finances on doing things we enjoy together in our free time.\n\nBut now that we have a daughter, buying a house feels like something we should have done already. It also feels like something that’s increasingly out of reach, as housing costs remain high and mortgage rates skyrocket.\n\nA real estate sign outside a home in Morgan Hill, California, on October 4, 2022. Housing prices in the US soared during the pandemic, making it harder for millennials to buy homes. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWe’re not alone in feeling like we’re behind in taking this big step, according to Kevin Mahoney, a financial advisor in Washington who specializes in helping millennials.\n\n“People are really stressed about not being homeowners,” he says. “One thing I try to communicate to them is, it’s OK to rent. You’re buying yourself flexibility. You’re buying yourself time to figure out what you want your next 20 years or next 10 years to look like.”\n\nDespite frequent handwringing over millennials not buying homes, Mahoney also points out that plenty are. One reason for America’s housing crunch, he says, is that more millennials are now entering the housing market.\n\nIt’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one, which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nOlder millennials aged 32-41 made up a quarter of homebuyers this year, according to a National Association of Realtors report, and millennials have been the largest share of homebuyers since 2014.\n\nBut as CNN has reported, many millennials are worse off than their parents.\n\nAnd millennials are less likely to own homes at this point in their lives than previous generations. There’s a good reason for that, says Gray Kimbrough, an economist and adjunct professor at American University who’s repeatedly taken to Twitter to dispel myths about millennials.\n\nHasbro in 2018 issued a cheeky Millennials edition of its classic Monopoly board game. Its game tokens included emojis and a hashtag. Courtesy Hasbro\n\n“It’s gotten harder to buy a house if you don’t already own one,” he says, “which makes it really hard to buy a house if you’re in your 20s or 30s and have rented for years.”\n\nNot to mention that millennials have faced a far bleaker financial picture than older generations, Kimbrough says.\n\n“It’s really hard to think about getting married, having kids, moving out with roommates, and making any of these transitions with the housing market like we have now,” Kimbrough says.\n\nMy husband and I are trying not to be too overwhelmed by this daunting reality.\n\nWe’re visiting open houses on most weekends and planning to meet with mortgage brokers soon.\n\nBy this time next year, we hope we’ll be living in a home that we own.\n\nMyth 4: We don’t take our jobs seriously and don’t stay in them very long\n\nJason Dorsey tells me he often asks a question when he’s invited to visit companies and speak with their employees: “How many of you are millennials?”\n\nGenerally, he says, just a few hands timidly go up.\n\n“They’re expecting it to be negative, because that’s unfortunately what we’ve been framed as for the last 15 years,” Dorsey says.\n\nThat’s around when Dorsey says he saw anti-millennial hype intensifying. Back in 2007, he appeared on a “60 Minutes” segment ominously titled, “The Millennials Are Coming.”\n\nReporter Morley Safer didn’t pull any punches in the piece’s introduction: “A new breed of American worker is about to attack everything you hold sacred: from giving orders, to your starched white shirt and tie.”\n\nHe went on to warn that “the workplace has become a psychological battlefield and the millennials have the upper hand,” describing a generation that can “multitask, talk, walk, listen and type, and text.”\n\n“They talked about us like we were space aliens,” Dorsey recalls.\n\nThis 2007 \"60 Minutes\" segment described millennials as \"a new breed of American worker (that) is about to attack everything you hold sacred.\" CBS\n\nI missed that segment when it came out; I was a newspaper reporter at the time, likely scrambling to cover breaking news on the weekend night shift that started my much-longer-than-40-hour work week.\n\nI think I would have found the premise problematic even then, but now, with the clarity of hindsight, the “60 Minutes” story seems almost cartoonish – another chapter in a tale as old as time. “Anxious Older Generation Worries Naïve Younger Generation Is Destroying Everything” could have been an equally fitting title.\n\nConsultant and author Lindsey Pollak, who advises companies on how to navigate multigenerational workplaces, thinks the rise of social media is partly to blame for millennials’ longstanding bad rap. Pollak says our generation came of age under a microscope unlike any generation before us.\n\n“All the criticism of the millennials – we said it about every generation, but it was just amplified by the internet and social media,” she told me.\n\nMillennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. Gray Kimbrough, economist and professor\n\nDorsey says that during his presentations, details about millennials often surface that surprise many people in the room.\n\n“It turns out they’re the largest generation in that company’s workforce,” he says.\n\nHe finds that many employees had bought into the stereotype and assumed millennials were slackers or flakes. But actually, he says, millennials are often among a company’s most successful workers and managers. And by the end of his presentation, all of them are raising their hands.\n\nKimbrough tells me millennials have been staying in jobs for just as long as previous generations.\n\nYoung professionals navigate Manhattan streets on March 31, 2022, in New York City. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\n“Obviously people earlier in their careers shift jobs at a higher rate than people later in their careers,” he says. “Millennials have not been uniquely more likely to job-hop earlier in their careers. Actually, they’re switching jobs less. There’s actually been a big decline in job-switching since about 2000.”\n\nIt’s been more than 12 years since I’ve switched jobs. And I’m hoping to stay in this one for many more.\n\nLike me, many of my friends have been working for their employers for more than a decade. Others would have stayed, but found themselves the victims of corporate restructuring.\n\nRepeatedly weathering economic crises is an important piece of millennials’ story, too.\n\n“So many times, millennials tell me they finally feel like they’re on the right track,” Dorsey says, “and then something happens that’s beyond their control.”\n\nMyth 5: We’re forever young\n\nI remember when my dad turned 40. The mere idea of it seemed ANCIENT to me. His coworkers taped black crepe paper around his photo and hung it around the office. I was 9, and gave him a framed poem I’d written about how he shouldn’t feel bad about getting old.\n\n“The gears in your head are still turning around,” I wrote, “and your brain still works, as far as I’ve found.”\n\nSo, yes, the idea that now somehow I’m 40 is something I’m still trying to wrap my head around. On most days, I still see myself as a young adult finding my way in this crazy, confusing world.\n\nBut when I commiserate with my husband about our ever-growing list of weird aches and pains, about how we don’t really like going to loud restaurants anymore, and about The Way Things Used To Be, I realize I’m not quite ancient, but I’m definitely more middle-aged than I’d care to admit.\n\nYes, the youngest millennials are in their mid-20s. But the oldest are approaching middle age. Shutterstock\n\nStill, when I first read last year that the oldest millennials were starting to turn 40, that detail jumped out at me. The concept seemed so surprising. For so long, we’ve seen the same picture painted of millennials over and over.\n\n“People talk about millennials as though it’s this universal term for young people…which it’s not,” Pollak says.\n\nSometimes, when I look at my daughter, this idea really sharpens into focus as I feel my age hurtling toward me like a ton of bricks.\n\nShe’s so much younger than I was at this point in my parents’ lives. Or, put another way, I’m already so much older than my parents were when they were raising me. I was nearly 39 years old when my daughter was born. My husband had just turned 41. When she graduates from high school and heads to college, we’ll both be nearly 60. And if she waits as long as we did to have kids – if she decides that’s right for her – we could be 80 when we become grandparents.\n\nThinking about things this way fills me with anxiety and a tinge of sadness.\n\nWe’ve grown up seeing ourselves … as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged. Amil Niazi, writer\n\nWriter Amil Niazi, who turned 40 this year and has two young children, describes it perfectly – talking about how she finds herself constantly doing this kind of math and “getting hung up on the numbers.”\n\n“Now that I have these tiny, sweet, loving kids, all I want is more time with them, to hit pause, not on their growing and changing, but on me and the version of myself as a parent that I am right now,” she wrote in a recent piece for The Cut, where she’s also explored how hard and confusing it is to be middle-aged. “To pause the back and knee pain that grows a little more sharply every year, to halt the gray hairs and the high cholesterol, skip over the inevitable medical scares and exhaustion that seem to envelop more and more of my days.”\n\nAs I struggle to come to terms with entering my 40s and think lofty thoughts about being an aging millennial, my daughter brings me back to earth by pointing to the woman on the cover of \"Look Great Over 50\" and shouting, \"Mommy!\" Catherine Shoichet/CNN\n\nNiazi, like me and so many other middle-aged millennials, has been coming to terms with what it means not to be young anymore.\n\n“My entire life … the cultural story has always been about our youth. And it’s always been about us as this sort of young disruptive generation that was too spoiled, that had arrested development, that was upending family life, retirement, housing, employment,” Niazi told me. “We’ve grown up seeing ourselves that way, as the young upstarts, as the disruptors, as the people around whom culture, and especially youth culture, are shaped. Of course we’re going to feel fed up about the fact that we’re now middle aged.”\n\nRecently, I stopped by a bookstore with my daughter to pick up a few gifts.\n\nShe’s almost 18 months old and walking now, and as soon as I put her down she bounded over to the magazine section, where there were plenty of things to explore right at her eye level.\n\n“Mommy!” she exclaimed as she gleefully pointed at the cover of a magazine and plucked it off the rack.\n\nA beaming brunette looked out at me from beneath the title, “Look Great Over 50.”\n\n“She does look pretty great,” I thought to myself, “but OVER 50?!”\n\nMaybe my daughter was just sharing her joy at browsing in the bookstore? Surely, she couldn’t think I was more than a decade older than I am already.\n\nBut as she wandered around the magazine section for the next 20 minutes, she kept coming back to that one, saying “Mommy” every time.\n\nI almost corrected her. “Oh, that isn’t Mommy,” was on the tip of my tongue when I realized it doesn’t matter if somehow she does see me on that magazine cover.\n\nThere is so much I’m still trying to figure out, so much all of us – millennials and non-millennials alike – are struggling with as we make our way through life.\n\nAs Niazi notes, the math is truly daunting. And as this year so painfully reminded me, we never know how much time we’ll have with the ones we love.\n\nWith all this uncertainty, there is one thing I know: My daughter and I are so lucky to be together right now, sharing an evening in a bookstore – something I did with my parents, and something I’d always dreamed of doing if I ever had a child of my own.\n\nAs I watch her toddle down the aisles of the store, I feel so proud of how happy and curious she seems to be.\n\nHer generation doesn’t even have a name yet – or at least not one we know will stick. No matter what we call them someday, I can’t wait to see what they do.", "authors": ["Catherine E.

Check fayobserver.com to see profiles throughout the month of February.\n\nELIZABETHTOWN — On Feb. 1, 1960, four students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University sat down at a lunch counter intended only for white customers at the Woolworth’s on Elm Street in Greensboro.\n\nTheir bold actions were met with resistance but eventually led to the store removing its policy of racial segregation, a move that would change the social structure of North Carolina forever.\n\nRufus Lloyd reflects on this moment as he was a student at NC A&T and graduated in the spring of 1960.\n\n“I was there. I sure was. I never got a chance to actually sit at the counter, but it was a lot of excitement and everything that was done was done in a peaceful manner,” Lloyd said. “It was all well planned and executed. It was a real experience.”\n\nMore:Myron B. Pitts: The Black experience means walking through doors opened by struggle\n\nAt the time, he was studying education and had plans to move back home to Bladen County and give back to the community that reared him. He would become one of the first Black teachers in rural North Carolina to usher in integration in the Bladen County school system and create a long legacy of public service.\n\nA real people's person\n\nFor as long as he can remember, Lloyd always wanted to be an educator. He grew up in the Carver’s Creek Community, a small farming township located several miles from Elizabethtown. The oldest of seven children, Lloyd grew up knowing the value of hard work, determination and caring for his neighbors.\n\nLloyd, now 82, has an education career spanning 34 years.\n\nIn 1961, he began teaching at Spaulding Monroe High School, now considered West Bladen High School. He then moved to Elizabethtown to teach elementary and middle school, a job he truly loved.\n\n“I was always a people’s person; I enjoyed working with people and being around people,” said Lloyd. “I’m consistently seeing and talking with students that I taught here and still have that close relationship with them and the parents, can’t forget about them.”\n\nLloyd taught social studies and earned a master's degree at Fayetteville State University in administration and supervision. At Clarkton Middle School, and later at Bladenboro High School, he served as assistant principal.\n\nHe remembers the different changes that took place throughout his career in the school system. He taught a generation of students from all backgrounds and walks of life and by the 1970s, he taught and helped even more students from all over the county.\n\n“At the beginning of integration, it was a totally new experience,” Lloyd said. “We had teachers from the Elizabethtown schools to move in, it was a challenging experience and a great change that took place here. We didn’t have a whole lot of issues and the movement was very smooth.”\n\nIn Bladen County, the school system was established in August of 1839 and by the 1960s, there were nine schools for Black students and eight schools for white students. Schools in the county were fully desegregated by the end of 1971.\n\nLloyd believes the transition was “successful” despite the various forms of discrimination in the area.\n\n“I can’t truly say in our area it was a major issue, but like other places it was there,” Lloyd said. “You had to adapt to the change and move according to what was in the best interest of the students and the people that you had to work and deal with.”\n\nSome of Lloyd’s favorite memories as an educator are the ones where he made long-lasting relationships with his students and people he worked with.\n\n“The people that I have grown to know are great people,” Lloyd said. “It’s been wonderful. I’ve just enjoyed giving my community in Elizabethtown and Bladen County services.”\n\nLloyd simultaneously served on the Elizabethtown Planning Board for 35 years while he worked in the school system. When he retired in 1993, he continued his service on the Elizabethtown Town Council. He currently serves as mayor pro tem.\n\nSome of his other accomplishments have been serving on countless boards and in civic organizations in the county. He is a member of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc., the Boys and Girls Club, the Bladen County College Advisory Board, Bladen County Smart Start, the North Carolina League of Municipalities, to name a few.\n\nLloyd is also a member of the First Missionary Baptist Church in Elizabethtown and serves as chair of the deacon board.\n\nMakings of a man\n\nLloyd’s humble beginnings in Carver’s Creek shaped his life.\n\nHis parents, Rufus and Louise Lloyd, were hard workers and he said having to work on the farm taught him “about the land” and the importance of caring for the things that give life and help people survive.\n\n“Surprisingly enough, I think this younger generation has no idea what the rural community has to offer and what takes place out in farming communities where our food industry and products come from,” Lloyd said.\n\nHe would raise livestock and grow various plants to feed his family and neighbors.\n\n“They just don’t know what it’s like to see pigs and cows and plants and how they grow, and the process that takes place from the beginning to a finished product. It’s just amazing to have that experience.”\n\nIn 1963, Lloyd married his childhood friend and sweetheart, Gloris Andrews Lloyd, who is also a teacher. She is an alumna of Winston-Salem State University and was one of three Black teachers who taught at the Elizabethtown Primary School at the top of integration.\n\n“We grew up in the same community and started out in the first grade together and finished high school together,” Lloyd said.\n\nThey built a house in Elizabethtown in 1967 and have been there ever since. Though they have no children, the Lloyds have had students and community involvement to keep them busy and engaged for years. Both are active in organizations and wear several different “hats.”\n\nHerman Lewis, a council member of Elizabethtown, says that every encounter with Lloyd has been “pleasurable” and he admires his accomplishments in the town.\n\n“He was a mentor for me before I went into administration part of education and started me along,” Lewis said. “You always need that person to look up to and he’s been that for me.”\n\nLewis, an Elizabethtown native, is also a retired educator and Fayetteville State University graduate. They worked together while Lewis was a teacher at Bladenboro High School, where Lloyd was assistant principal.\n\n“He has an ability to relate to young people,” Lewis said. “Some teachers, administrators just have a better rapport with getting them to understand when they mess up without creating a whole conflict. He has that gift to get people to move in the right direction. That’s what I've really learned from him. The best thing I can say, he’s a praying man. ”\n\nThe Lloyd Park\n\nIn 2017, the town of Elizabethtown honored Lloyd with a park in his honor.\n\nLocated on Swanzy Street, the town’s newest park addition was named for Lloyd and his many contributions to the betterment of the town.\n\nLloyd was humbled by the ceremony and is still grateful for the opportunity to have been considered. He passes the park every day when he goes to work at the town council.\n\n“It’s a wonderful feeling and great that they thought that much of me to name it after me,” Lloyd said.\n\nHis colleague, Ricky Leinwand says Lloyd is “solid as a rock.”\n\n“He’s just a good man and we're very fortunate to have him,” said Leinwand, the owner of the Leinwand’s department store in Elizabethtown. “He’s someone that we depend on and if there is any kind of controversy, he knows how to settle things down and there aren’t many. I’m just proud to be on the town council with him because you can always depend on Mr. Lloyd.”\n\nLloyd does the prayer before every town council meeting and Leinwand has always known him to be a faithful servant.\n\nLeinwand’s father served as mayor of Elizabethtown for years before his death and thought highly of Lloyd and his work, too.\n\n“He always said Mr. Lloyd was one of his favorites,” Leinwand said. “My dad is smiling right now knowing that Mr. Lloyd is part of the Leinwand park area.”\n\nCurrent Mayor Sylvia Campbell agrees that Lloyd has been an asset to the success of the town council.\n\n“He’s got a direct line to God is what I say a lot about Mr. Lloyd,” Campbell said. “He’s just a wonderful person, wonderful man. There are just not enough good things to say about him.”\n\nLloyd still comes to work with the same goals to serve and bring people together that he had when he was younger. For him, there is not a day that goes by when he isn’t grateful for what he was able to do in the rural community of Elizabethtown.\n\n“No one gets to where you are by yourself,” Lewis said. “It’s the people behind you and I have enjoyed giving back to the community and letting those that I’ve had the opportunity to work with know that I appreciate the support they’ve given me. I appreciate the opportunity to give back to them something.”\n\nStaff writer Kristen Johnson can be reached at kjohnson1@gannett.com or 910-486-3570.\n\nSupport local journalism with a subscription to The Fayetteville Observer.

The high school senior lives in Princeton, New Jersey, but he wanted to feel the energy of a big metro area. He was considering schools such as Fordham University in New York City and Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.\n\nNow that the coronavirus outbreak has spread across the country, Klein, 17, wishes he had applied to a wider variety of schools, specifically those in rural areas that might be less affected by the virus. He is glad, though, that he applied to his mother’s alma mater, Miami University in Ohio. It initially wasn’t high on his list, but now he is reconsidering.\n\nAfter all, he said, what’s the point of living in a bustling city if he can never leave his dorm under a quarantine?\n\nKlein joins thousands of students around the country rethinking their fall 2020 college decision – or wondering whether they’ll be able to go to college this fall at all. Their reasons, according to surveys by college advisory groups, include a desire to be closer to home, disrupted financial situations and concerns that another semester may go digital-only.\n\nCollege upended:US colleges scrambled to react to the pandemic. Now their very existence is in jeopardy.\n\nStudents’ enrollment decisions are only one way the coronavirus could dramatically remake American higher education. Institutions are in damage control, trying to offer courses online while recruiting their future classes. They’re hurting financially as they offer students refunds for housing, meal plans and even parking permits. In extreme cases, like the San Francisco Art Institute or MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois, institutions have announced they will not admit new students or plan to wind down current operations. Others are freezing new hires or laying off contract workers.\n\nHigher education was ripe for a remake. Before the virus hit, college had never been more expensive, and the nation’s ever-increasing student loan debt was raising questions about the value of college. The economic free fall and uncertainty from the virus have families questioning expensive tuition even more.\n\nMoody's Investors Service had already dinged the American higher education system earlier this year, but last week it issued an even more grim diagnosis. The agency wrote in a news release that it expected student enrollment to drop in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Australia and Singapore through the next year because of the coronavirus. That would mean less money for colleges to pay professors and administrators and run thriving, beautiful campuses.\n\nThe ratings agency also warned that endowments and gift-giving may decline. With declining economies, states may have less money to fund universities, Moody’s said. And, it said, the pandemic may keep international students, with their high tuition rates, at home.\n\nStay in America, or go home? Coronavirus pandemic brings stress, fear for international students.\n\nConcerns about finances, and financial aid\n\nUniversities will get a fuller picture of enrollment starting on May 1, traditionally the deadline for students to accept a college’s offer. Some colleges have pushed that back to June 1 amid the pandemic.\n\nBut early signs point to more students staying home or postponing college. The percentage of students completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly known as the FAFSA, has declined in recent weeks.\n\nAs of April 3, the rate of FAFSA completion was down 2 percentage points compared with last year at the same time, said Bill DeBaun, director of data and evaluation at the National College Attainment Network, which tracks how many students have completed their FAFSA. The percentage dropped in the past three weeks, about the same time many high schools shut down in-person classes, and it dropped most steeply in schools that serve low-income students. Some high schools help students fill out these forms, and without them, students can’t be eligible for the financial aid many would need to go to college.\n\n“If you’re a student and you have any intention at all of enrolling in the fall or the next academic year, I would encourage you to complete the FAFSA so you have an understanding of what federal financial aid may be available to you,” DeBaun said.\n\n'You're laid off. Sorry':When coronavirus closed colleges, student workers lost jobs\n\nMany families who already were counting on financial aid may see their incomes decline amid the disruptions to the economy, putting more pressure on their finances. More aid could be available, said Justin Draeger, CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators\n\nColleges, he said, do have the ability to adjust how much money a family is expected to pay, so students should call their college’s financial aid office. However, some aid, whether from the college or the state, is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so it might already be allocated.\n\nColleges may try to recruit students away from competitors\n\nEven before the coronavirus complicated college recruiting, admissions were going to be more competitive this year. That change is thanks to the Department of Justice’s antitrust investigation into the trade group that governs ethical admissions practices among colleges, the National Association of College Admissions Counseling.\n\nA key change under NACAC’s deal with the Justice Department: Colleges now are allowed to reach out to students who applied to their institution but ultimately chose another college. The result? Colleges can try to encourage students to transfer to their institution or change their initial admissions decision, even after they’ve put down a deposit.\n\n“People use the word ‘poach,’ and I have been trying to come up with another word,” said Jayne Caflin Fonash, president of NACAC and an independent college counselor.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus adds more unpredictability to an already-competitive recruitment cycle. The traditional campus visits, which many students use to make their final college choice, aren’t possible and have been replaced with digital options instead. Some students will wait until June 1 to pick a college, possibly with a better picture of the pandemic outlook.\n\nThe uncertainty around college enrollment could continue. Fonash questioned how recruitment would work in the fall. It’s unclear, she said, if recruiters and prospective students will be able to travel or if they will have to stick with digital options.\n\nOne boon for prospective students: Many universities have waived their requirement for prospective students to submit scores from the ACT or SAT standardized tests. “It will relieve the stress and anxiety for a number of students,” Fonash said.\n\nWill 'test-optional' become the norm? University of California lawsuit could change the future of SAT, ACT testing for college admissions\n\nThe next round of cancellations? New-student orientation\n\nStudents who do decide to try to go to college, assuming coronavirus restrictions have been relaxed, may face more uncertainty. Some colleges have already canceled summer orientation, increasing the possibility that a student could be visiting a school for the first time this fall.\n\nLoyola University Maryland, a private school in Baltimore, usually hosts its new-student orientation in person in midsummer, but Eric Nichols, vice president for enrollment management, said the university moved that session online. The college has also connected prospective students with current students, financial aid administrators and faculty members.\n\n“It doesn't replace being on campus in person,” he said. “But especially for a lot of families who have already been on campus once, it's been very helpful.”\n\nNichols said the university also admitted a slightly larger class than normal to make up for the fact that some students who were accepted may decide not to attend. But Nichols said he was more concerned about “summer melt” – students who have committed to the university but then change their minds. He said some students may go to multiple orientations since they don’t have to attend in person, and that may mean they take more time to make their final decision.\n\nCoronavirus student loan stimulus:Suspended payments, plus relief from collections\n\nCommunity colleges: A popular choice?\n\nOne group of colleges could benefit from the economic crisis: community colleges.\n\nOften in times of economic recession, more people enroll in college to improve their employment prospects.\n\nEven before the crisis, Joseph Castro, president of California State University-Fresno, had noticed an increase of students applying to the state’s community college system. He suspects that many students and families worried about the cost of college have chosen that option, especially as the national conversation around free community college has grown louder in recent years. (Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders had proposed some form of free college as part of their Democratic presidential platforms.)\n\nCastro sees that trend continuing as a result of the pandemic. And he said parents and students may find value in starting at a community college and then transferring to a public regional university like Fresno, which are often cheaper than more selective universities.\n\n“That's a great thing for our society. It will lower debt levels and potentially provide more access,” Castro said.\n\nBut all of those projections rely on students enrolling in the fall.\n\nKlein, the New Jersey senior, said he is going so far as to consider a gap year. His intention isn’t to gallivant around the globe. Rather, he wants the “best college experience.” What that looks like in the time of coronavirus remains to be seen.\n\nCorrection: A previous version misstated how much FAFSA applications have declined.

These are hallmarks of social anxiety, a phobia of being judged, negatively evaluated or rejected in a social or performance situation, according to the Anxiety & Depression Association of America.\n\nSocial anxiety is one of the most common mental disorders around the world, Fallon Goodman, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of South Florida, told CNN’s Chasing Life podcast: “About 4% of the world population will have social anxiety disorder at some point in their lives, which is roughly 300 million people.”\n\nIt can really limit a person’s life. “Clinical social anxiety is that level of social anxiety that keeps you from really living your life,” Wendy Suzuki, a professor of neural science at New York University, told Chasing Life. “It keeps you inside because the fear of having these social interactions is so high.”\n\n“The treatment of choice (is) cognitive behavioral therapy, as it is with most anxiety disorders,” clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula, a professor of psychology at California State University, Los Angeles, told Chasing Life. “If you can help a person change how they think or perceive about a situation, you’ll likely change the reactions and the behaviors.”\n\nI decided to try cognitive behavioral therapy nearly two years ago.\n\nUnpacking the fear through CBT also involves learning how to realistically evaluate anxiety, become more emotionally resilient, and shift one’s attention in social settings to being fully present and engaged. Some therapists include social skills practice and small exposure to usually avoided activities, according to Think CBT, a therapist-led organization based in the United Kingdom.\n\nA life unlived\n\nI remember being a shy and worried kid at a very young age. When my father and I would discuss some family issue, he’d see the anxiety in my face and emphatically say, “Don’t worry.”\n\nThe apprehension was ingrained in my personality, and it got worse as I got older. My earliest memory of debilitating social anxiety happened when I was 14 – a reflection of the trend that over the past 50 to 60 years, the average age social anxiety begins has gone from 20s to ages 12 to 14, Goodman said.\n\nWhen working at internships or jobs, I frequently took different routes to avoid unexpectedly encountering people when I hadn’t prepared anything to say. In social situations, I’d become so scared and preoccupied with the possibility of judgment that my mind would go blank.\n\nMy reactions felt like a medical crisis: My hands shook, my stomach turned, my armpits got clammy, my body tensed, I stammered. Sometimes I had trouble visually focusing on whatever was in front of me. I even went to the hospital 10 years ago because my heartbeat had been suddenly speeding up before my breathing could catch up, leaving me out of breath. After having my vitals checked and undergoing scans, the doctors told me it was probably related to mild anxiety. These heart palpitations continued over the years.\n\nI had trouble making friends because I was so guarded and mistrusting of people’s feelings, even if they had expressed affection and acceptance. Having “Happy Birthday” sung to me was nerve-racking. And large gatherings felt impossible: Amid thousands of people at concerts, I felt the audience might be judging me. I ping-ponged between this helpless fear and feeling shameful about how narcissistic my mindset seemed to me.\n\nI overanalyzed what I said and sometimes cried or felt physically sick from the stress. It was even worse when I knew I had disappointed someone.\n\nChanging my mind\n\nFor years, I didn’t tell anyone about my social anxiety because I was terrified people would judge me or not take me seriously.\n\nThe March 2020 shutdown due to the pandemic changed everything for me. I realized trying to fix my social anxiety on my own wasn’t working. I wanted to feel normal and not ruin my chances at a career, relationships or friendships.\n\nI started CBT appointments in September 2020. This therapy can also include exercises focused on self-acceptance, mindfulness and breathing.\n\nI had CBT assignments to complete and discuss with my therapist, who helped me integrate these lessons into my daily life. It wasn’t easy. I learned that constantly trying to be perfect was irrational, and that not being perfect didn’t make me any less lovable, qualified or worthy. What was most important was doing my best.\n\nChallenging negative thoughts meant asking myself several questions: Is there any substantial evidence for my thought, or evidence contrary to my thought? Am I trying to interpret this situation without all the evidence? If I look at the situation positively, how is it different? Will this matter a year or five years from now?\n\nAnswering these questions multiple times in therapy and on assignments helped me ask those questions in stressful times.\n\nMindfulness and self-acceptance work also meant I stopped taking people’s negative moods or cool responses personally, knowing sometimes their reactions had more to do with their lives. Before gatherings or work opportunities I was anxious about, I’d often do a few minutes of progressive muscle relaxation, which relaxed my heart rate, muscles and mind.\n\nI was surprised CBT worked for me, but it has been found to be significantly more effective than supportive or talk therapy in reducing social anxiety symptoms and improving overall functioning. A CBT model similar to my experience was beneficial for a small group of adults with social anxiety, who did 14 weekly 90-minute sessions and homework after each meeting.\n\nPeople who did 16 sessions of CBT experienced a greater reduction in negative emotions and improvements in the part of the brain that helps people reappraise the meaning of an emotional stimulus to change its impact, compared to a waitlist group that did nothing, according to a 2013 study.\n\nChanging my life\n\nMany who have recovered from addictions or cognitive distortions know all too well the path to recovery isn’t linear. There have been setbacks, plateaus and moments when CBT was painful because I had to confront how I felt about myself and the experiences that led to that self-perception.\n\nPositive changes didn’t happen overnight – I occasionally noticed small improvements, but realizing total change has been more like painting a wall with thin layer over thin layer until the wall’s saturated in color – you don’t notice the difference until it’s a total 180 degrees from what it used to be.\n\nEighteen months in, I typically live such a good life between appointments that my therapist and I sometimes don’t get to discussing whatever we had planned to cover. I have an amazing group of close friends, whom I can’t see enough. I love being in the office and how much opportunity for connection it presents. I have the best time at concerts, and I’m dating. Before, avoidance overrode any desire to see people. Now, I sometimes resent the fact I have finite time on Earth, because there is so much to do and experience.\n\nI still fumble in social settings now and then. Don’t we all? But the difference between my pre- and during-CBT self is that now, I laugh off my moments of social awkwardness instead of ruminating over them for days.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I accidentally spilled coffee on a table at the beginning of my first meeting with a high-level supervisor. Instead of thinking the person would deem me incompetent and that that would harm my career, I lightheartedly apologized and accepted the box of tissues she gave me to clean it up.\n\nI look forward to future career and social opportunities, knowing I’ll likely still face some nerves and awkward moments. My hands still might shake at times, and my armpits might feel clammy. But I’ll know that most people are understanding and likely won’t be thinking much of my social blunders – and that if they do, that’s on them. I’ll know it’s not the end of the world – and that the world is what I want to see and experience, even if I flub a little along the way.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/08/wildfire-smoke-air-quality-alerts-live-updates/70300980007/", "title": "Air quality updates: The latest on wildfire smoke swarming the US", "text": "New Yorkers were gripped by the worst urban air quality in the world Thursday, and Americans could face days or even weeks of smoky siege from the drifting haze of unrelenting Canadian wildfires.\n\nHundreds of community parks, ballfields and other outdoor spaces from Canada to North Carolina sat empty as air quality readings in many areas ranged from unhealthy to hazardous.

Not really, experts say\n\nThe best thing to do when air quality outside is unhealthy due to wildfire smoke is stay indoors, but what if you have to go out? Is there a best time of day to do it?\n\nExperts say, not really, and the answer can vary depending on a specific location, weather, topography and other factors.\n\nIn areas of the East Coast that are impacted by the Canadian wildfires, the source of the smoke pollution is constant, so the air quality levels aren’t changing all that much with the time of day, Prof. Valentina Aquila, an atmospheric scientist at American University said.\n\nIf you have to go out, “rather than suggesting an hour, I would actually suggest to wear a mask,” Aquila said.\n\n“For wildfires, although smoke levels may fluctuate throughout the day, there is no safe time, so outside activity, especially strenuous activity, should be minimized,” Michelle Bell, a professor with the Yale School of the Environment, said.\n\nSo, don’t try to go for a jog at any time of day when air quality is unhealthy, and if you have to go out for any other reason, keep it short and put on a high-filtration mask, experts say.\n\n-Jeanine Santucci\n\nPublic schools go remote\n\nSchool districts in parts of the East Coast announced plans to conduct classes on Friday remotely due to no significant improvements in air quality.\n\nNew York City Public Schools — the nation's largest public school system — decided to pivot to remote instruction mostly affected high schoolers because other grades already were scheduled to have the day off.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution for the health of students\" and since Philadelphia's air quality designation was in Code Red on Thursday, the School District of Philadelphia said all schools will shift to remote learning on Friday.\n\nWith graduation ceremonies planned for Friday, the district said all indoor ceremonies will proceed but outdoor ceremonies will be moved to alternative locations.\n\n-Thao Nguyen\n\nAir quality concerns cause event cancellations, delays\n\nAs poor air quality and smoke blanketed the eastern United States, a host of events were canceled or postponed on Thursday and into Friday.\n\nSeveral public performances and outdoor activities scheduled on Thursday and Friday were canceled in New York City. In Syracuse, New York, a Chris Stapleton concert was postponed and fireworks were canceled at Niagara Falls, New York.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the White House Pride Month celebration on the South Lawn was delayed until Saturday, citing air quality concerns. Local officials also closed public parks.\n\n-Thao Nguyen\n\nBelmont Stakes up in the air due to NY's poor air quality\n\nThe third leg of horse racing's Triple Crown is in doubt as New York's air quality remains dangerous.\n\nSaturday's Belmont Stakes could be canceled as racing, training and workouts at Belmont Park were canceled Thursday due to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issuing a state order due to poor air quality.\n\nAs a result, the start of the three-day Belmont Stakes Racing Festival was postponed.\n\nThe New York Gaming Commission said in a statement that the racetrack is shut down until further notice as it \"continues to monitor air quality and rely on guidance from veterinary expertise to ensure any decision to resume racing is based solely in the best interest of the horse population.\"\n\nHochul said Saturday's race with a $1.5 million prize for the winner could be called off if the air quality index exceeds 200 on its scale. However, if the air quality is between 150 to 200, only horses that pass an additional pre-race vet examination will be allowed to compete.\n\n\"As New Yorkers continue to experience unhealthy air quality as a result of Canadian wildfires, we must all work to ensure that animals - including these peak-performance equine athletes — are protected,\" the governor said on her official website. \"The measures being implemented at tracks across New York State are effective steps to keep all those who participate in the sport safe now and into the future.\"\n\nIt's not clear when or if the order will end. The state's air quality remained unhealthy on Thursday, according to Accuweather.com.\n\n\"Safety is paramount as we navigate this unprecedented situation,” David O'Rourke, the New York Racing Association's president and chief executive, said Thursday. \"NYRA will actively monitor all available data and weather information as we work toward the resumption of training and racing both here at Belmont Park and at Saratoga Race Course.\n\n\"Based on current forecast models and consultation with our external weather services,\" O'Rouke continued. \"We remain optimistic that we will see an improvement in air quality on Friday.\"\n\n-Terry Collins\n\nPennsylvania, New York City see uptick in patient visits\n\nHospitals and medical centers in the Philadelphia metropolitan area reported an increase in patients seeking care for respiratory issues.\n\n\"Patients have been complaining about throat and eye irritation.

Wildfire smoke is a mix of gases and fine particles that can cause harm in multiple ways, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOlder adults, pregnant women, young children and people with chronic heart and respiratory conditions are more likely to get sick if they breathe in wildfire smoke. But the CDC says even healthy adults can also experience coughing, breathing issues, stinging eyes, scratchy throat, runny nose, irritated sinuses, chest pain, headaches, asthma attacks, fatigue and fast heartbeat. And the American Lung Association says wildfire smoke can be “extremely harmful” to lung health.\n\nRead more here.\n\nWildfire smoke can also harm the skin and even prompt \"psychiatric conditions,\" said Dr. Raj Fadadu, a physician and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies extensively on the health impacts of wildfire smoke given that state’s annual battles with wildfires.\n\nFadadu urges those in other parts of the country experiencing wildfire smoke to be more “self-aware” about potential smoke-induced health effects on their bodies going forward.\n\n\"This increase in air pollution is new to many (people),\" he said. \"Their bodies are confused about what’s happening. Please pay attention to even the slightest things, including a headache, eye redness, and even some itchiness or a rash. ... Don’t ignore any symptoms.\"\n\n− Adrianna Rodriguez and Terry Collins, USA TODAY\n\nThe science of an orange sky\n\nMillions of horrified Americans have watched clear blue skies morph into thick orange fogs in recent days. While familiar to many Americans living in the western part of the country, the eerie orange hues have frightened and confounded some in regions of the nation less accustomed to the effects of wildfires.\n\nSmoke particles from the fires allow sunlight's longer wavelength colors, like red and orange, to pass through while blocking the shorter wavelengths, like yellow, blue and green.\n\n\"That's similar to during sunrise and sunset times when the sun is near the horizon and sunlight has to travel through more of Earth's atmosphere to get to you,\" NASA explains.\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Grace Hauck\n\nAQI forecast: How the index works\n\nThe U.S. Air Quality Index, or AQI, is the Environmental Protection Agency's tool for communicating daily air quality. It uses color-coded categories to describe air quality, which groups of people may be affected and steps that can be taken to reduce exposure to air pollution. It’s also used as the basis for air quality forecasts and current air quality reporting. Metro areas with a population of more than 350,000 are required to report the daily AQI, and you can find the daily AQI on AirNow and on state and local agency websites.\n\nState and local air quality experts provide forecasts across the nation. In most areas, AQI forecasts focus on the next day. For ozone, an AQI forecast focuses on the period when average eight-hour ozone concentrations are expected to be the highest. For particulate matter, the forecast predicts the average 24-hour concentration for the next day.\n\nWhat do the AQI numbers mean?\n\nThe AQI is measured on a scale of 0 to 500. The higher the AQI values, the greater the level of air pollution and health concern there is, according to AirNow.gov. Conversely, the lower the AQI values, the air quality is more satisfactory and the health risks are lower. A measure of 50 and under represents good air quality. Anything above 300 is considered \"hazardous\" and will usually prompt a health warning.\n\nThe EPA determines the AQI values based on five major air pollutants which are regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.\n\nRead more here.\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nWildfires in Canada still burning, could roar for weeks\n\nMore than 400 blazes burning across Canada have left 20,000 people displaced. The U.S. has sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. A primary culprit for fouling U.S. air is the 150 fires burning in south-central Quebec, a majority of which were not contained. A stalled high-pressure system over the northern Plains and the stationary low-pressure system over eastern Canada has produced a \"steering\" wind from north to south, sending thick plumes of smoke into the Northeast, Middle Atlantic and Ohio Valley, AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson said.\n\nThe fires are mostly in remote, wooded areas − and since most of Canada's firefighting focus is on saving homes, the blazes are likely to continue burning into the summer, Anderson said.\n\n\"So get used to these episodes of smoke and haze through the summer,\" he said.\n\nWho or what caused the wildfires in Canada?\n\nUnusually hot, dry weather that wouldn’t stop gave rise to the wildfires. Most were ignited by lightning, experts say. A warming planet will produce hotter and longer heat waves, making for bigger, smokier fires, according to Joel Thornton, professor and chair of the atmospheric sciences department at the University of Washington.\n\n“The month of May was just off the charts, record warm in much of Canada,” said Eric James, a modeling expert with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Science at the University of Colorado. “I don’t remember (Canadian) fires of this scale in the last 10 years.\"\n\nSurreal photos show NYC covered in glowing orange haze from Canada wildfire smoke\n\nNew Jersey could move out of red alert status today\n\nAn air quality alert remains in effect for New Jersey through Thursday night.

Musicians from small island ...", "text": "Fresh from the stage at the United Nations Climate Change conference, a troupe of musicians plucked from small island nations across the globe is bringing its performance, culture and message about shifting seas to Tempe.\n\n\"Small Island Big Song\" is a collaboration between eight Indigenous musicians and vocalists who were brought together by filmmakers BaoBao Chen and Tim Cole. As a group, they represent the island nations of New Zealand, Taiwan, Australia, Madagascar, Solomon Islands, Mauritius, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea and Tahiti.\n\nThey will perform a multimedia concert experience at the Tempe Center for the Arts on Saturday featuring traditional instruments and languages highlighting Pacific and Indian Ocean cultures. Tickets cost between $10 and $25 and can be purchased on the venue's website.\n\nChen, who is from Taiwan, and Cole, who is Australian, are a married couple who met in 2012 while documenting traditional practices on Vanuatu, a nation of about 80 small islands stretched across 800 miles in the South Pacific Ocean. In 2005, the United Nations recognized the Vanuatu island of Tegua as possibly the world's first climate change refugee site after 100 residents had to be relocated inland as a result of storm surges and waves linked to climate change.\n\nClimate migration book review:As climate disasters force people to flee, a new book examines the modern migrant quandary\n\nSince then, human migration and displacement due to climate-influenced weather disasters has increased. In 2022, the UN Refugee Agency reported that 84% of global refugees and asylum seekers were from highly climate-vulnerable countries, an increase from 61% in 2010. As of 2020, only 1% of people who fled these regions were able to return home, due to lost settlements from flooding and other climate impacts.\n\nThe agency now lists 22 countries of particular concern for climate migration. In the United States, rising seas have already forced tribes living in what is now parts of Louisiana and Alaska to pull back from their coastal homelands.\n\nA bridge over troubled waters\n\nChen said her experience on Vanuatu caused her to pivot her filmmaking to focus on capturing and bringing awareness to the cultural and natural resources at risk of vanishing forever amid rising seas and chaotic storms. When a Vanuatu elder looked at her and asked her where she was from, she realized island nations needed to band together to showcase what the world stands to lose in the near term if the global fossil fuel emissions driving climatic changes are not reined in.\n\nShortly after, the fifth report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published in 2014 after six years of work by an international team of scientists, emphasized with very high confidence that coastal areas and low-lying developing countries would face some of the most extreme, destabilizing and near-term impacts of global warming. It estimated that damage and adaptation costs in these places would add up to \"several percentage points of gross domestic product\" while stunting tourism income and erasing human settlements.\n\nThe news lit an even bigger fire under Chen and Cole. Within a month, they quit their jobs with only about $3,000 between them, and fully launched themselves on a journey of recording the effects of climate change on islands.\n\n\"The first week we thought, what can we do as two people? We were sort of hit by this anxiety of ‘What is our future?’\" Chen said. \"Tim and I really just looked at the resources we have and the skills that we have. We know we’re not politicians or scientists that are going to fix the numbers and stuff. But we really see the power in us and in culture.\"\n\nThey traveled to different island nations, meeting with local musicians, recording their sounds and connecting the dots. Chen relayed an experience in Papua New Guinea when the village's master drummer shared with them a rhythm he composed in response to watching coral reefs die from elevated temperatures and ocean acidification caused by rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. He asked them to take it to musicians on other island nations who are also seeing coral bleaching firsthand.\n\n\"So we took this song to Madagascar, Taiwan, the Great Barrier reef in Australia, Solomon Islands,\" Chen said. \"And now that's actually one of the songs that people will see in the concert (in Tempe), a live version, called 'Gassy Cara,' by musicians from more than 10 countries representing about 100 artists altogether.\"\n\nOther musical events about the climate:With 'Mass for the Endangered,' a composer has written a hymn for climate absolution\n\nIt wasn't always easy bridging these different sounds and cultures from islands that, in some cases, have complicated pasts and limited ability to communicate with each other. Chen remembers the first rehearsal when they brought everyone together. Although \"not everyone spoke the same sort of colonized language,\" she said, the musicians sat in a circle and found the similarities between them.\n\n\"Everyone started to count from one to 10 in their own Indigenous languages and found that they all share these common words,\" she said. \"That was the moment when everyone really thought, 'Wow, you're my family just from another island.' Then now, coming together to see the same issues they are facing as islanders is very powerful.\"\n\n“Often we think the ocean separates all the islands, but actually it unites us,\" Cole added. \"The differences between us can actually be where our strength is, what does unite us.”\n\nOn common ground, no human is an island\n\nThe resulting collective known as Small Island Big Song has now spent about a third of each of the last seven years traveling, sharing the \"voices of our island homes,\" all of which have witnessed the \"soul destroying\" death of reefs and sea life, a brochure reads.\n\nThe initiative is supported by the Taiwan Culture Ministry, the Australia Council for the Arts and the Ian Potter Cultural Trust of AsiaLink and Creative Victoria. The current \"Our Island\" tour started in the U.S. in early 2022, then visited Italy, Taiwan, Australia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates before returning to the U.S. for 19 stops during February and March of 2024.\n\nCole said it was strange being in Dubai for the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference in November, seeing the lavish lifestyle in the desert there and how removed it was from the lifestyle on the islands. As the only performing arts group invited to the meeting by the official organizers, they played for the world leaders actively deciding the fate of their homelands.\n\nRead our series:The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral, a column on climate change\n\nStill, Cole and Chen emphasized that despite the gloomy scientific predictions for island nations and lackluster global action to address climate change, they focus on putting on a joyful performance that unites people in a call to \"give it our full gusto right now to bring the momentum and change that we can.\" With just a tinge of rage.\n\n\"We hope people will come share the space with us and the ideas and the thoughts and that it’s about empathy and inspiring rather than blame and anger,\" Cole said. \"But there is some anger in the show too. It’s a sort of empowering anger toward things like this extraordinary lament for the loss of coral reefs, but in a way that is so sincere.\"\n\nBy sharing the joy and grief of the islands, the performers hope to help inland residents understand their value and need for collaborative protection. The 2024 tour is also hitting the landlocked states of Vermont, Michigan and Iowa.\n\nArizona State University professor Greg Asner's research mapping the coral reefs around Hawaiian islands and tracking their resilience to heat events underscores the widespread importance and vulnerability of coastal ecosystems. These biodiverse marine zones serve as nurseries for global fisheries, which employ and feed millions of people.\n\n\"It’s important to understand that coral reefs are critical to the economy and commerce,\" Asner told The Republic in 2022. \"The connections are pretty amazing. First of all, at least 25% of all species that live in the entire ocean spent part of their life in a coral reef. So even if you’re only connected to the ocean by eating fish, which is a large portion of humanity, you should care about what happens to coral reefs.\"\n\nConnections:How marine heat waves in Hawaii have ripple effects all the way to Arizona\n\nJust as the islands offer a little something for everyone, the performance in Tempe will serve up a mix of climate information and multicultural, multimedia performances featuring unfamiliar instruments.\n\nThe valiha, a tube zither made from bamboo and strings once borrowed from bicycles, Chen said, is the national instrument of Madagascar but very rare and, like many coastlines, about to disappear. Other musical devices on stage on Saturday will represent the rich Austronesian history of seafaring, when early islanders took instruments with them in outrigger canoes for the long journey following the currents from Taiwan to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Micronesia.\n\n“We’re proud to put on a show that’s every bit dynamic and engaging and makes you want to rip your heart out,\" Cole said. \"And you won’t recognize any of those instruments.\"\n\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Oddly, that’s a good thing: It’s a sign you still have a working sense of smell – even if it’s miswired in your brain.\n\nYour ability to smell can also disappear completely, a condition called anosmia. Without warning, you can no longer inhale the sweet odor of your baby’s skin, the roses gifted by your partner or the pungent stink of your exercise clothes.\n\nTaste and smell are intertwined, so food may be bland or flavorless. Appetite and enjoyment of life may plummet, which past studies show can lead to nutritional deficits, cognitive decline and depression.\n\nDanger lurks as well. Without smell, you may not recognize the telltale signs of fires, natural gas leaks, poisonous chemicals or spoiled food and drink.\n\nSuch is the reality of some 5% of global Covid-19 survivors who have now developed long-lasting taste and smell problems, according to a 2022 study. More than two years into the pandemic, researchers found an estimated 15 million people may still have problems perceiving odors, while 12 million may struggle with taste.\n\nSupport and advocacy groups such as AbScent and Fifth Sense have mobilized to help, offering affirmation and hope, tips on smell training and even recipes to bolster appetite.\n\nSmell or olfactory training encourages people to sniff essential oils twice a day, said rhinologist Dr. Zara Patel, a professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n“The way I explain it to patients is if you had a stroke, and it made your arm not work, you would go to physical therapy, you would do rehab,” Patel said. “That’s exactly what olfactory training is for your sense of smell.”\n\nAs science learns more about how Covid-19 attacks and disrupts smell, “I think you’re going to see interventions that are more targeted,” said rhinologist Dr. Justin Turner, an associate professor of otolaryngology, head and neck surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nAnyone still struggling with a loss of smell and taste “should think positively and assume their sense of smell will return,” Turner said. “Yes, there are some people that won’t recover, so for those folks, we want them to not ignore it. We want them to take it seriously.”\n\nCases exploded due to Covid-19\n\nPeople have been losing their sense of smell and taste for centuries. Common cold and flu viruses, nasal polyps, thyroid disorders, severe allergies, sinus infections and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis can all damage the ability to smell and taste – at times, permanently.\n\nSo can head trauma, exposure to noxious chemicals, cancer treatments, smoking, gum disease, antibiotics and various blood pressure, cholesterol, reflux and allergy medications, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSome people who have had Covid-19 suffer long-term problems with their sense of smell. Adobe Stock\n\nGrowing old is a major cause of smell loss as the ability of the olfactory neurons to regenerate declines. A study conducted in 1984 found more than 50% of people between ages 65 and 80 years suffered from “major olfactory impairment.” The number climbed to more than 75% for people over age 80.\n\nWhen the virus that causes Covid-19 invaded our lives, a condition that was relatively rare among people under 50 expanded exponentially, affecting all ages.\n\n“Covid-19 affected younger people much more than other forms of post-viral smell loss,” said surgeon Dr. Eric Holbrook, an associate professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Harvard Medical School. “You wouldn’t see much smell loss in the pediatric population, for example, and now it’s very common.”\n\nIn fact, loss of smell was so prevalent at the beginning of the pandemic it was considered the canary in the coal mine – an early sign of Covid-19 infection even in the absence of other symptoms.\n\nThat’s not true today. A study published in May found 17% of people lost their sense of smell when infected with the Omicron variant, which became the predominant variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 in late 2021. (This could change again if the virus mutates.)\n\nIn comparison, people sickened by the two original variants, Alpha and Beta, were 50% more likely to lose their sense of smell or taste. Delta was nearly as bad – 44% of people were affected, according to the study.\n\nStatistics show most people recover their sense of taste and smell. An August analysis of 267 people who lost smell and taste at least two years ago found the majority either fully (38.2%) or partially (54.3%) recovered their ability to smell and taste. That was especially true for people under 40, according to the study.\n\nBut 7.5% had not recovered their sense of smell and taste two years after their Covid-19 infection cleared. Those who were least likely to recover included people with existing nasal congestion, more women than men, and those who had a greater initial severity of smell loss, the study found.\n\nHow damage occurs\n\nHow does Covid-19 damage the olfactory system? At first scientists believed it infected neurons in the nose responsible for transmitting smells from the environment into the brain. Those neurons sit in the olfactory bulbs at the very top of each nostril and send out axons, or cables, to unique sensory spots in the brain.\n\nSoon studies discovered the virus does not enter those neurons at all. Instead, it attacks sustentacular cells, also known as supporting cells, which provide nourishment and protection to nerve cells from birth. Unlike many other cells, neurons in the nose undergo rebirth every two to three months.\n\n“(Covid-19) infection of those supporting cells likely has some sort of long-term effect on the ability of those neurons to regenerate themselves with time,” Turner said.\n\n“That’s one of the reasons we sometimes see a delayed effect: People may have some smell loss that recovers, then later they have a second wave of smell loss, parosmia or other symptoms because that regenerative capacity is malfunctioning,” he said.\n\nParosmia is the medical term for distorted smells, which can often be quite disgusting, Patel said.\n\n“Unfortunately, there’s these classic categories of really terrible smells and tastes,” she said. “Sometimes it’s feces, garbage or old dirty socks. There can be a sort of sickly, sweet chemical type of smell and taste. Oh, and rotting flesh is another common category.”\n\nFor many people, parosmia tends to occur or reoccur at the three-month mark, about the time olfactory neurons would naturally be regenerating, experts told CNN.\n\n“If the reconnection misses its target and hits a different spot in the brain reserved for a different odor, your perception of smell is going to be totally screwed up,” Holbrook said.\n\n“You have to rely on the ability for those axons to retract and then find their way to the right spot,” he added. “Or if they’re not correct, wait for those neurons to die off and have new ones come back and find the right spot.”\n\nScience continues to discover ways the virus attacks. A study from February found it may also damage olfactory receptors that sit on the surface of nerve cells in the nose. Those receptors bind smells and trigger the nerve impulses that transmit the information to the brain.\n\nThere may also be a genetic component. A January study discovered a mutation in two overlapping genes, UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, that play a role in metabolizing odors. People with that mutation may be more susceptible to losing their sense of smell, but further studies are needed to determine the virus’s association to the genes – if any.\n\nPeople who are older and have chronic diseases that affect the nervous system, such as diabetes, are often more susceptible to olfactory damage, Patel said.\n\n“It’s the very small vessels in the body, including the nose, that are affected by diabetes, disturbing blood, nutrient and oxygen flow to these olfactory nerves,” she said. “People with chronic sinus or allergy inflammation in the nose – anything that makes it harder for our system to bounce back will likely be at higher risk as well.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/18/opinions/year-in-culture-opinion-column-carr/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The irony behind this word of the year | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nWilliam Carlos Williams is perhaps best known for the red wheelbarrow on which so much depends, but “Spring and All” – the 1923 book which includes that poem – is a manifesto on how language, through its own slow renewal, can recreate the world. “It is the imagination on which reality rides,” Williams wrote. “To whom then am I addressed? To the imagination.”\n\nIn 2012, the Library of Congress cited “Spring and All” as one of 88 “books that shaped America,” which feels, as we prepare to take on 2023, like a prescient gesture, one that anticipated the power of imagination to create change and the role of culture in efforts to attend to the present while staying connected to the past and committed to transforming the future.\n\nSometimes the past speaks directly from the page. As Laura Beers wrote, George Orwell’s perspective following the Second World War forecast the realities of 2022: disinformation, “reality control,” and freedom of expression as the bedrock of all other freedoms – making it the most important, and also the most vulnerable to attack and suppression. For Issac Bailey, a free copy of Mark Twain’s “A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court” opened his imagination in ways a childhood stutter had kept locked inside – and prompted him to speak out against ongoing efforts to ban books.\n\nOliver Bunic/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOr it’s a single word. Take Merriam-Webster’s word of the year: gaslighting. Its selection was a statement on the precarity of truth in our lives, but Nicole Hemmer, who wrote one of the first pieces connecting the term to then-candidate Donald Trump in 2016, objected to synonymizing “gaslighting” with lying without emphasizing its origins as a form of psychological abuse against women. “This loss of context for a single word might not feel urgently important – after all, words evolve as they work their way from novel to commonplace to, eventually, trite (as the word ‘gaslighting’ now feels after years of overuse). But in a culture where histories of abuse are regularly erased – even five years into the #MeToo movement – the erasure feels significant,” insisted Hemmer. Changing one word’s meaning can empower women to claim their experiences and take one more step toward justice and equality.\n\nConsider also how cultural figures have loomed large this year in our most painful moments. As Peniel E. Joseph reminded us, cultural icons including basketball coach Steve Kerr and actor Matthew McConaughey spoke out after the massacre of 19 schoolchildren in Uvalde, Texas, serving in Joseph’s words “as courageous models for a progressive White male identity that challenges systems of oppression, speaks truth to power and confronts the divisions of our current moment by publicly highlighting the gap between the nation’s professed values and a more bitter reality that allows 19 children to be killed in such grotesque fashion.”\n\nAnd during the Jackson water crisis, W. Ralph Eubanks recounted how the richness of Mississippi’s literary and cultural heritage informed his conviction that “Mississippi has something to say … Mississippi matters.” And yet, while in Jackson to celebrate that heritage, he instead encountered “a new way the past and the present are colliding in Mississippi. Instead of the cultural charm and pull of this place that I love so much, I was confronted by the remnants of Jim Crow Mississippi living on in the present.”\n\nBut if I might borrow and riff on Williams’ formulation to look back at 2022 in cultural commentary, another part of the reason reality rides the back of imagination is because the latter functions as a source of joy and revelation that can invigorate the former. After the last few years, don’t we deserve a little more of that?\n\nCourtesy A24\n\nIn March, absurdist dramedy “Everything Everywhere All At Once” – led by Michelle Yeoh playing Evelyn Wang – took the screen by storm, offering what Jeff Yang described as a “perfect metaphor for this thing we call Asian America.” In the film, Yeoh’s character “can conjure up any reality she imagines, bringing substance to the outrageous worlds of her imagination by drawing power from the infinite diversity of her myriad selves – making many into one, sometimes by chance, sometimes by choice. And we, as Asian Americans, are in the process of doing the same, building a cultural collage out of mixed media and lived experiences,” wrote Yang.\n\nSummer romance took an unconventionally sexy (and equally dramedic) turn with Emma Thompson’s “Good Luck to You, Leo Grande,” which chronicled her recently-widowed protagonist’s quest for sexual pleasure and her first orgasm – with a sex worker. This is a new kind of romance, affirmed Sara Stewart – a romance between Thompson’s Nancy and her own post-60 body: “Talk about a message at odds with our current political moment, where women’s bodily and autonomy and power are under siege.”\n\nCome fall, noted Stewart, it was time to be served some “eat the rich” satire in “The Menu” and “Triangle of Sadness.” Predictable, perhaps, given a pandemic “in which billionaires got richer while millions died,” she wrote. But while investing any film with “single-handedly dismantling capitalism seems too heavy a lift … Mark Twain said, ‘the human race has only one really effective weapon and that is laughter.’ We can at least capitalize, so to speak, on these films’ painting their ultra-rich subjects as inherently ridiculous. We can begin to puncture the idea that obscene wealth is the ultimate American aspiration,” argued Stewart.\n\nMore on films that made a difference in 2022:\n\nLilit Marcus: ‘CODA’ didn’t change my life.

It’s more than a show about teaching, he insisted – it’s a show that, like its city of origin, “teaches you. And one of its lessons is not to understand anyone or anything too quickly, but to give each person time and space to figure themselves – and each other – out.”\n\n2022 was also the sophomore year for Netflix’s Regency-era hit “Bridgerton,” and Holly Thomas outlined how the show’s second season made her fall in love with Anthony Bridgerton like the rest of us, while stressing the importance of remembering “just how rooted in fantasy ‘Bridgerton’ is. It suggests that a strikingly bigoted country – one which failed miserably to accept a non-White royal in the 21st century, let alone the 19th – has managed to dismantle structural racism in a generation, all because the king made a Black woman his queen. … All this to say, literally nothing is beyond the redemptive power of love on this show.”\n\nThat’s a far cry from “The Crown” – now a fifth-year senior with a new cast – where love is nowhere to be found and, as Thomas noted, fiction is rightly putting history in the corner. (In other streaming period drama-drama of the Regency variety, Thomas also praised the Jane Austen “adaptation” of “Persuasion” for being a so-bad-it’s-brilliant work of sneaky genius.)\n\nMore smart takes on television:\n\nSara Stewart: ‘Dahmer’ debate is finally saying the quiet part about true crime out loud\n\nBill Carter: Trevor Noah’s bombshell was almost predictable\n\nOlachi Ihekwaba: I turn to romance series when nothing else makes sense\n\nLindsey Mantoan: ‘House of the Dragon’ isn’t perfect, but it may be what we need\n\nA post-Roe reality\n\nEven before the Supreme Court released its decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in June, women across America began speaking out about what the end of Roe v. Wade meant to them. Laura Beers shared that her own parenting journey could be rendered illegal or practically prohibited in states with abortion bans. Her younger son was conceived via IVF after she endured a miscarriage requiring a dilation and curettage procedure in one pregnancy and chose to abort another after a fatal anomaly was discovered. “Each step in my journey to motherhood – the D&C following my miscarriage, my abortion, and my IVF treatment – relied on the good faith support and care of doctors committed to helping me achieve the healthy pregnancy that I so desired,” Beers wrote. “Recent anti-abortion legislation imperils the ability of doctors to provide similar care to their patients.”\n\nFranchetta Groves, a student at Catholic University, wrote in June that the Dobbs decision didn’t feel like a setback, but rather a triumph for those like herself who identify as pro-life. “After Roe, I believe it will be possible for our nation to be one that doesn’t cast judgment on women who become pregnant, but one that embraces them with love and compassion,” she reflected.\n\nDr. Mae-Lan Winchester, an Ohio maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works with high-risk pregnancies and whose patients have had to go out of state for abortion care, wrote in October that “it felt like a slap in the face to be told by lawyers … that my medical opinion is not enough for the law to permit me to provide the care I am trained to give. … I worry that the next lawyer I discuss a complex case with will not understand, and that the patient who needs an abortion will be denied. I worry they will lack the time, money, transportation and support to get the care they need. … I am scared they will die.”\n\nAnxieties over the realities of a post-Roe America touched families who fear the rollback of rights around contraception and same-sex marriage. As Joan Lester wrote: “Twice, I’ve survived the legal marital shadows,” in her first interracial marriage to a Black man and in her later same-sex union to a woman. “I wonder and worry: are they coming for my marriage next?” They touched our daily lives as directly as the phones in our pockets do (as Katherine Yao and Megan L. Ranney noted in citing the vulnerability of data gathered by period-tracker apps) – or as routinely as our kids’ activities (as Ranney also wrote after a Florida school’s request for athletes’ period data raised legal and security issues).\n\nFor more:\n\nCNN contributors: The conflicts in a post-Roe America are just beginning\n\nErika Bachiochi, Reva Siegel, Daniel Williams and Mary Ziegler: We disagree about abortion but with one voice support this urgently-needed law\n\nWhither Twitter?\n\nMike Blake/Reuters\n\nWhen Twitter accepted Elon Musk’s offer to buy the company in April, Kara Alaimo warned it could be a death knell for the social media platform: “Musk has been vocal that he thinks Twitter should be a platform for mostly unfettered speech,” she wrote, but “allowing harmful forms of ‘free speech’ – like misogyny and hate – on Twitter will actually have the effect of silencing many people and will be disastrous for the social network.”\n\nOnce Musk took the reins at Twitter in the fall, he gutted the company and reinstated users who had engaged in hateful or mendacious speech on the platform in the past. Hate and harassment, already a problem, skyrocketed. Roxanne Jones deleted her account on the same day Musk took over, after years of battling haters online as a Black woman in the public eye. She wrote: “Waking up to toxic attacks on Twitter kept me in beast mode, on and off the site. That’s what the Twitter-verse will do to you. … Twitter will have you fighting anonymous bots meant to misinform the masses and real people who don’t have the courage or the intellect to challenge you in person.

The wave of public grief was immediate, and the opposition to and conflictedness around that grief equally passionate. And in marking the seven decades of her reign in its unmatched longevity, from her 1953 coronation (the first televised) to her death at 96, “Britain closes a chapter on its past, a farewell to members of the wartime generation that saw this country’s finest hour, encapsulating as they did the spirit of 1940, when Britain stood alone against fascism, undaunted and unbowed,” wrote Rosa Prince.\n\nIn her nearly 71 years on the throne, Queen Elizabeth stood alongside countless world leaders, most of them men, including 12 American presidents (she met a 13th, Harry S. Truman, while still a princess). “Queen Elizabeth’s sovereignty was framed by her gender even before she came to the throne,” observed Sarah Gristwood. “For 70 years, the British people have grown used to singing ‘God Save the Queen.’ To sing ‘God Save the King’” – as the British people will conceivably do for at least three generations, with Charles, William and George – “will catch in the throat for some time to come.”\n\nFor more on the royal family:\n\nHolly Thomas: King Charles’ biggest problem isn’t his crown, but his voice\n\nPeggy Drexler: Why ‘Harry & Meghan’ is a royal disappointment\n\nMichelle Obama’s new role\n\nDerek White/Getty Images\n\nIn November, Michelle Obama published another best-selling book, and what made “The Light We Carry” fascinating, assessed Nicole Hemmer, was that it was not a follow-up to her memoir “Becoming.” Hemmer classified it as a self-help book, except instead of a life coach, readers get a former first lady. Unlike Eleanor Roosevelt, who wrote an advice column for two decades, or more recent first ladies’ children’s books or policy statements, Hemmer wrote that Obama picks up where Betty Ford left off, sharing her own authenticity in service of a social purpose and building a brand beyond the limitations of her political role: “She has an intuitive sense of how blurred the lines have become between not only the personal and the political, but between influencer and politician. In this book, Obama shows her desire to use that tangle of emotion and power to bring people together, but the ease with which feelings and politics now blend is also a reminder of how easily that combination could also be used to divide.”\n\nDon’t miss:\n\nJill Biden: What Ukrainian mothers taught me about this war\n\nAdrienne Childs: Why the Obamas’ portraits matter\n\nHow to fix what’s wrong on campus\n\nThe dismissal of a renowned adjunct chemistry professor from New York University in October after a spate of student complaints about his teaching reinvigorated a series of long-standing questions about the modern academy, wrote Jill Filipovic. “Are academic standards dropping? Are professors and administrators too beholden to students’ fragile emotions – and their parents’ tuition dollars? And what’s wrong with kids these days, anyway?” Filipovic argued that the university got it wrong: “Whether or not [Dr. Maitland] Jones was an effective teacher for aspiring medical students is up for debate, but in firing him, NYU is effectively dodging questions about the line between academic rigor and student well-being with potentially life-and-death matters at stake.”\n\nWhen it comes to mental health on campus, the stakes couldn’t be higher, noted David M. Perry, who classified recent lawsuits against Yale and Stanford Universities as a necessary spotlight on the need to do better at caring for students with mental health disabilities. “The good news is that there are solutions,” he wrote. “Which is good, because the bad news is that as Generation Covid arrives on campus, students whose entire high school experience has been shaped by living through an ongoing global mass death event, the quotidian pressures of college life are only going to get worse.”\n\nMore sharp campus takes:\n\nIssac Bailey: I was the kid who stayed silent in college\n\nEvan Mandery and Michael Dannenberg: It’s time to put an end to early decision\n\nDavid M.

Watching women realize their limitless capacity for greatness is a beautiful thing. … Many women of all economic backgrounds, including those in my own peer group, are reimagining and expanding what success looks like in our lives. It isn’t an easy choice to make.”\n\nThe magic spun by the bat of Aaron Judge in late summer and early autumn kept many in thrall, but Jeff Pearlman had harsh words for Major League Baseball’s myth-making attempts to capitalize on the spark, finding them hypocritical after years of sweeping rampant doping under a rug of greed. Aaron Judge “has had a season for the ages,” wrote Pearlman. “This should be an historic time for baseball. This should be an historic time for Aaron Judge. Instead, greed destroyed baseball – and took its history with it.”\n\nAt a Qatar World Cup staggeringly diminished by human rights protests and the untimely death of legendary US soccer journalist Grant Wahl, the Moroccan national team brought light by praying and joyously kissing the covered heads of their mothers – in a year when in France (whose team are the defending World Cup champion), women athletes had been banned from wearing hijab while playing sports (a move Shaista Aziz contended dehumanized French Muslim women). Wrote Khaled Beydoun from Doha: “Morocco’s celebrated run of World Cup victories has been, in some ways, vicarious vindication against Belgium and Spain, Portugal and France – the most formidable of its former colonial overlords and present footballing foes. While much of France remains largely trapped within a dark history of its own making, Morocco is remaking its own history, claiming its place in the world and the World Cup.”\n\nMore on sports:\n\nMichael Croley: The March Madness shot that broke our hearts and the real tragedy that followed\n\nAmy Bass: Elite women athletes aren’t safe.

She also reflected on a recent conversation with friends, all of whom are grinding through a time of suffering, that brought her to tears. “It’s ok to be fragile,” her friend told her. “We’re all fragile now.” “Yeah,” she thought, “and maybe we’re ready to be joyful, too. It’s winter. It’s cold. The holidays are coming. We’re about to try to find light in darkness.”\n\nFor Amy Bass, joy is going to rock concerts with her high school best friend – and their two teenage daughters. “It has been an amazing experience. I loved every second of watching our girls battle for position in the pit at Harry Styles’ show. … Indeed, just as we once joined the thousands of voices walking out of a U2 show singing ’40’ long after the band had left the building, our girls are part of a generation of fans that seems to look out for one another,” Bass wrote in a reflection on Taylor Swift-mania and Ticketmaster. Getting tickets to concerts has never been easy, recalled Bass, who remembers sleeping outside in the cold to stay in line for tickets and getting Joey Ramone’s guitar pick after her mom accompanied her into a venue at age 15 due to her lack of ID. But Bass argued this amazing generation of kids deserves more magic and less merch.

OSU QB to finish career at Syracuse", "text": "Nearly two weeks after initially entering the NCAA's transfer portal, Kyle McCord has revealed where he will spend his final season of eligibility:\n\nThe former Ohio State quarterback has committed to play for Syracuse and first-year coach Fran Brown, as was originally reported by ESPN's Pete Thamel and later confirmed by the signal-caller himself:\n\nREQUIRED READING:Signs of discontent: Here is how and why QB Kyle McCord decided to leave Ohio State\n\nMcCord's likelihood of starting is much higher in Syracuse than it was in Ohio State, even amid reports that Ryan Day and his coaching staff wanted him to return for his senior season after throwing for 3,000-plus yards in 2023. Day's refusal to commit to McCord as the starter moving forward — coupled with the commitment of Air Noland in the 2024 recruiting class — contributed to McCord's decision to transfer.\n\nBut why did he settle on Syracuse? Here's a look at McCord's decision to transfer to the ACC school in his final year of eligibility:\n\nWhy did Kyle McCord transfer to Syracuse?\n\nAs reported by ESPN, McCord's familiarity with Brown and his coaching staff was a major factor in his decision to transfer to play for Orange football. He knows not only Brown, but also Nunzio Campanile and Jeff Nixon, currently the New York Giants' run game coordinator who is expected to be Syracuse's offensive coordinator moving forward.\n\n\"I think the experience on the coaching staff is extremely important,\" McCord told ESPN. \"It was a big factor in my decision. Just being at a place where I can be surrounded with good players. They've done some good things on the portal trail, bringing in some guys from Georgia and other places. All of that, when you combine it, makes it an appealing destination.\"\n\nMoreover, McCord told ESPN he knows other New Jersey-area football players currently on the Orange's roster in Denis Jaquez Jr. and Alijah Clark.\n\n\"Just being around a bunch of guys I played football with growing up,\" McCord told ESPN. \"Being around coaches I've known forever. It felt like everything is happening at the right time.\"\n\nBut it was more than Brown's staff and the ability to start that factored in on McCord's decision.\n\nCOLUMN:Return of the 'Incredibly-Clever-Except-When-It's-Not' college bowl picks column | Oller\n\nKyle McCord high school\n\nKyle McCord attended St. Joseph's Preparatory School in Philadelphia, where he committed to play for the Buckeyes. He won the starting quarterback position as a sophomore and, according to his Ohio State player bio, threw for 2,883 yards and 38 touchdowns while completing 66.5% of his passes that season.\n\nHe followed up with 2,399 passing yards and 31 touchdowns as a junior before he sat the final four games of the season, then helped St. Joseph's win its third consecutive 6A state championship as a senior. He was a member of the 2020 Pennsylvania MaxPreps All-State team and set city and league records for career passing yards (6,887) and touchdown passes (88).\n\nMcCord was a five-star prospect in the 2020 recruiting class per 247Sports' Composite ratings. He was the No. 28 player nationally, the No. 6 quarterback and the No. 2 player from the state of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhere is Kyle McCord from?\n\nMcCord is a New Jersey native, having grown up in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, before attending St. Joseph's. His father, Derek McCord, also has ties to football in New York, having played quarterback for Rutgers from 1988-92.\n\nREQUIRED READING:'He should not be able to move like he does': What OL Gabe VanSickle brings to Ohio State's 2024 class\n\nKyle McCord eligibility\n\nMcCord, who has one year remaining of eligibility, also noted that the ability to be an immediate starter was vastly important in his decision. To that end, he also looked at committing to Nebraska, though the Cornhuskers' attempt to flip quarterback Dylan Raiola off the 2024 recruiting class dampened that potential move.\n\n\"I have one more chance to go out and really commit myself, and going through the process, I was looking at schools where I'd have a chance of winning right away,\" McCord told ESPN. \"And with the pieces going there, I'll definitely have that option.\"\n\nSyracuse is due to have an opening at quarterback with Garrett Shrader likely to move on, leaving only Braden Davis and Carlos Del Rio-Wilson as the only scholarship quarterbacks on the roster.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/editorials/2020/03/19/whitney-social-distancing-tear-us-part-not-your-life/2869607001/", "title": "Whitney: Will social distancing tear us apart? Not on your life.", "text": "On Tuesday, March 10, there was little indication that our world was changing forever.\n\nMy biggest concern was finding a parking spot to cover the Summit League women’s basketball finals at the Denny Sanford Premier Center, where nearly 8,000 fans turned out to watch South Dakota defeat South Dakota State for a berth in the NCAA tournament.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, this is a magical time of year. March Madness is tipping off, spring break finds its footing, baseball is around the corner and outdoor wonders await. People are ready to expand their daily experience amid the lingering woes of winter.\n\nThat Tuesday night, I returned to watch the Summit League men’s finals with my son, greeting familiar faces in the concourse. As we took in the action, commenting on the players, there was no way to know that it would be the last stretch of normalcy we’d experience for a while.\n\nSure, we had heard about the coronavirus that originated in China and made its way to the United States, with the first American death reported in late February. There were frightening images of not just China but Iran and Italy failing to control the spread of COVID-19, with hospitals overwhelmed and death rates rising.\n\nBut those were newsreels, not imminent threats. Recent experience taught us that most global contagions were mitigated before causing major disruptions to American life, and surely that would be the case again.\n\nWe had no reason to think back to the Spanish Flu or smallpox, or even the swine flu pandemic of a decade ago. We were focused on the upcoming high school basketball tournaments, the possibility of spring flooding or how far the USD women might advance in the Big Dance.\n\nBut things were moving quickly. I remember pulling into my driveway the night after the Summit tournament and hearing that an NBA game had been abruptly canceled because Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert had tested positive for coronavirus. His teammates were quarantined in the locker room.\n\nIn the frantic hours that followed, the NBA suspended its season, college tournaments were played without spectators and President Trump addressed the nation from the Oval Office, mindful that the World Health Organization had declared a global pandemic.\n\nThe evening had a surreal quality to it, like someone had flipped a switch. My daughter, a sophomore at the University of Nebraska, was worried because many universities had shifted to online classes and sent students home, but UNL had yet to make the move.\n\nThen their men’s basketball coach, Fred Hoiberg, showed signs of illness during a Big Ten tournament game and headed to the locker room late in the second half. It turned out to be the flu, but the image of Hoiberg tilted over as his assistant coach slathered on hand sanitizer added to the mounting despair.\n\n“You’ll be home soon,” I told my daughter.\n\nThe following day, states began banning large gatherings, triggering a series of escalating upheavals, with the NCAA tournament canceled and Disneyland closed. By Friday of last week, Governor Noem had shuttered schools, the number of United States coronavirus cases had risen to 2,300 from 700 just days earlier, and my daughter arrived home from college.\n\nThey say adversity brings people together, and that’s certainly the case in our household. My wife and I are working from home, my daughter had to cancel her spring break trip and my son, a high school freshman, is reeling from not bring able to fill out an NCAA bracket.\n\nLike so many other families, we are facing this new reality with an awkwardness that comes from uncertainty. How to talk about the threat, how to live with the threat, how to avoid the threat – these are things to be learned along the way, using the best information we have.\n\nThe societal disruption, economic disorder and fear for the future bears similarities to the September 11 attacks, but those were terrorist acts over the course of several hours, taking nearly 3,000 lives before Americans focused on cleanup, rebuilding, healing and revenge.\n\nThis enemy is faceless and without emotion, borne by science rather than ideology. It doesn’t hate us but could slowly destroy us, like being in a room with rising water and no way to stem the flow.\n\nYet days go on, with commerce halted and livelihoods threatened. Social distancing means not only separation from each other, but from familiar rituals that give our lives rhythm.\n\nLast Saturday, in one last nod to normalcy, my family went shopping for a vacuum cleaner, stopped at Look’s Market for lunch and sat in an otherwise empty movie theater to watch Ben Affleck in “The Way Back.” Hand sanitizer was plentiful. We have rarely left the house since, replacing March Madness with board games and puzzles.\n\nThere is frustration and sadness surrounding experiences that were lost. I feel terrible for senior basketball players who saw their state tournament swept away and for college students who will not walk the stage at commencement. People are postponing weddings and adjusting funeral plans – uprooting landmark occasions as if rescheduling a trip to the dentist.\n\nOver time, though, these sacrifices might seem minor when compared to challenges we’ll face and the suffering that will occur in our community.\n\n“Look at the number of cases in South Dakota,” I’ve heard people say. “This is an overreaction.”\n\nTime will quiet those arguments. In many ways, it already has. When hospitals struggle to handle the influx of patients, with not enough respirators to go around, we’ll relate to the current crises in Seattle and New York City and our inconveniences will seem less extreme.\n\nThe cliché about grasping what is truly important applies here. We hold our loved ones close. We want to keep them safe. We appreciate the things that we have lost but remain confident we’ll find them again.\n\nMost of all, we learn that the human spirit cannot be canceled. It spreads exponentially, like its foe. When I see images of quarantined Italians signing and chanting to lift each other up, it's heartening to know that simple gestures loom large. I’ll have to settle for a neighborly nod, or maybe an elbow tap, while walking my dogs.\n\nOn one of my last forays outside the house, I stopped at a nearby liquor store to buy beer. When I asked the owner how business was going, he responded that it was picking up.\n\nDoes that mean people are drinking their misery away? Perhaps. But it also means ripples of regularity remain, as does the conviction that those things that make us a community – schools, churches, restaurants, sporting events, concerts – will return to reduce the distance between us, and we'll cherish them more than ever.\n\nArgus Leader Media columnist Stu Whitney can be reached at swhitney@argusleader.com.

Here are their stories:\n\nRehoboth officers save family dog\n\nAs temperatures soared on the Fourth of July, a 16-year-old cocker spaniel by the name of Hershey found herself stuck in a Rehoboth marshland.\n\nA worker at the City of Rehoboth Waste Water Facility heard the dog's cries and called police. Cpl. Bryson Ezell, Cpl. Dana Wyant and Sgt. Ray Edwards came to the rescue.\n\nBut no amount of calling to the small dog could get her out of the mud and over to the officers on solid ground. So police went in after her.\n\nNine ducklings rescued from ditch; six survive\n\nBody cam footage shared by the Rehoboth Beach Police Department shows how officers dragged out a small boat and launched it into the shallow water in order to reach the dog.\n\nOne officer balanced in the small dingy to reach Hershey, while another pulled them back to shore once the muddy dog was safely in the boat.\n\n\"Hershey was unharmed, but definitely in need of a bath,\" the police department said in the YouTube video. \"Thanks to these officers, a family avoided the loss of a long time companion.\"\n\nFirefighter turned actor turned Ocean View police officer\n\nRussell Colt Carter was killed by his law enforcement partner – but thankfully, that only happened on TV.\n\nThe now-Ocean View police officer played a detective in the 1990s crime hit, \"Homicide: Life on the Street,\" though he jokes that his acting role was more happenstance than skill.\n\n\"I wouldn't really call myself an actor,\" Carter said with a laugh. \"I just think I looked the part, so I probably got it for that reason.\"\n\nOff-duty firefighter at Del. 1 crash that killed 5 family members: 'It's the worst one I've seen'\n\nAt the time, Carter had been sent to the set of the Barry Levinson movie, \"Avalon,\" to serve as a technical adviser. Having grown up in Baltimore, Carter said he connected with Levinson and enjoyed helping out with behind-the-scenes work.\n\n\"One thing led to another,\" and Carter found himself doing a cold reading for a part. Then he joined the Screen Actors Guild. And then found himself not just working as a first responder, but playing one on TV, too.\n\nThough Carter wasn't yet a cop, he worked with the Baltimore City Fire Department for more than 20 years, commuting to Maryland from his West Fenwick Island home. That's how he was recruited by Ocean View Police Chief Kenneth McLaughlin for a spot with his department.\n\nCarter enrolled with the Delaware State Police Academy in 2003 and came out as an officer with Ocean View, where he continued to work part time while completing stints with Baltimore and then the Annapolis Fire Department.\n\n\"I think I have a little bit to offer, just practical experience,\" he said. \"I've tried to pass on (knowledge), especially the mistakes I've made over the years. I want to make sure no one else walks in those footsteps again.\"\n\nBirthday cake and basketballs\n\nA pick-up basketball game led to birthday cake last summer for a Wilmington boy who connected with two city police officers.\n\nThen-11-year-old Jarrell Turner got a big surprise when Master Cpl. Lorne Peterson and Sr. Cpl. Robert Steele led fellow members of their D-Platoon up the front steps of the family's Hilltop home with gifts in hand.\n\nThe officers, who met Turner at Judy Johnson Park during a game of PIG, believed that the young boy was trying to do the right thing. He started to the leave the basketball courts earlier that week as the street lights came on, saying his mom expected him home before dark.\n\nWilmington police pull West Center City back together 1 family at a time\n\nBut Peterson and Steele called Turner's mom, promising to walk him home after their game.\n\n\"We felt we needed to do something special for this kid,\" Peterson said. \"Not just get him a basketball, just do something a little special.\"\n\nAnd cake on their front porch was something special, especially to Turner's mother, who initially shut the front door when she saw the amount of officers congregated outside. The officers also pulled together enough money for a new basketball and tickets to see the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\n\"I wish we could do it more and I want to continue to do this more,\" Peterson said. \"I would say what we've done has trickled down to some of the officers who don't do this as much and we really see the difference.\"\n\nWater rescues on Delaware bays\n\nIt's not every day that a water patrol leads to rescue on Delaware Bay.\n\nBut on Aug. 10, Sgt. Troy Trimmer of the Delaware Fish & Wildlife Natural Resources Police rescued an entire boatload of people after their vessel took on water at the mouth of Roosevelt Inlet, leaving them stranded and swamped.\n\n\"Because of Sgt. Trimmer’s proactive patrols and quick response, he was able to pull all seven people out of the water to safety,\" the police department said.\n\nTrimmer then towed the boat to the Lewes fire dock. No one was injured, according to police.\n\nLast summer, Officer Tim Koebel sprang into action after a woman was thrown from a vessel \"spinning out of control\" in Rehoboth Bay, according to the department.\n\nKoebel was able to rescue the woman and wrangle the vessel with the help of another officer, police said.\n\nThe department said his actions saved the woman's life.\n\nFIRST RESPONDERS MAKING A DIFFERENCE\n\nCounselors ride with New Castle County Police to offer help to those in crisis\n\n21 years later, paramedic meets woman he helped deliver on bathroom floor\n\nNCCo police dog calms crime victims, and sometimes cops\n\nGot a great story involving law enforcement?

Smutny is also currently six months pregnant.\n\n\"With it happening on Christmas was such a low blow,\" said Wentz.\n\n'That's when I just knew it was our house'\n\nWhen the fire initially broke out, Wentz and his family were at Smutny's mother's house just a mile down the road. The group heard firetrucks fly by, but thought nothing of it.\n\nThat was, until, Smutny's mother jokingly said, \"Man, I hope everyone's okay there. That's not your house right?\"\n\nSmutny, troubled by the question, decided to check her home's numerous security cameras, but was unable to access the live footage.

For the latest and updated information on the wildfires, smoke and air quality across the US, visit our live updates file for Thursday, June 8.\n\n***\n\nSmoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted down into the U.S. on Wednesday, leading to extremely poor air quality across much of the eastern U.S., with alerts in effect all the way from New England to the Southeast. In all, more than 100 million Americans were affected by air quality alerts, the Environmental Protection Agency said.\n\nIn fact, New York City's air quality was the worst among the world's major cities for a time Tuesday morning, according to IQAir, an air quality monitoring website. As of Wednesday afternoon, IQAir said New York City's pollution was fourth-worst in the world, behind New Delhi, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Toronto.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams said that the city's air quality index on Wednesday climbed up to 484 out of a scale of 500, more than double the level that was reached Tuesday night. He said the city's air quality health advisory has been extended through Thursday night.\n\nDue to the unhealthy air, Major League Baseball postponed Wednesday night's games in New York and Philadelphia. It's the first such postponement since September 2020, when two games between the Seattle Mariners and the San Francisco Giants were moved from Seattle to San Francisco due to wildfire-related smoke.\n\nAlso, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul tweeted Wednesday that the state is making 1 million N95 masks available to the public due to the ongoing poor air quality from the Canadian wildfires.\n\n\"We are living in the era of extreme weather. Last summer, New York experienced extremely dry conditions and we had wildfires pop up across the state,\" Hochul said. \"While continuing our fight against climate change, we need to recognize that this is a new reality we have to be prepared for.\"\n\nThe poor air quality on Wednesday even made it as far south as Atlanta, where the National Weather Service said: \"particularly sensitive groups may be affected in north Georgia.\"\n\nSara Adar, from the University of Michigan's School of Public Health, said \"as many people in the Midwest and East Coast are learning right now, wildfire smoke can travel very far distances and impact large populations. To best protect health, people should avoid spending too much time outdoors right now, especially young children, the elderly, pregnant women and those with heart or lung disease,\" she said.\n\nMore than 100 million people affected by air quality alerts\n\nAccording to EPA spokesperson Shayla R. Powell, the EPA estimates that \"more than 100 million people are affected by air quality alerts today, ranging from Code Orange (Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups) and above. This area includes much of the Northeast U.S. – extending to Philadelphia to Chicago to the west and Atlanta to the south.\n\n\"We expect that air quality in this area is predominantly impacted by the Canadian wildfires, although more localized pollution emissions and meteorology may also play a factor,\" Powell said.\n\nUS sends firefighters to Canada as wildfires rage on\n\nMore than 400 wildfires were ablaze in Canada and officials have asked other countries for help fighting the worst wildfire season that country has ever seen, Canadian Minister of Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair said in a news conference.\n\nThe smoke from the blazes has been moved into United States since last month, but recent fires in Quebec have exacerbated conditions.\n\nAbout 100 fires were considered out of control Wednesday in Quebec, officials said, as New York City and Philadelphia saw some of the worst air quality of any major city.\n\nAccording to AirNow.gov, Philadelphia's air quality index was considered the most hazardous in the nation as smoke moved into the region Wednesday night. As of 12 a.m. Thursday, the city's air quality index was over 400.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said President Joe Biden sent more than 600 firefighters and equipment to Canada. The Biden Administration has also reached out to some U.S. governors and local officials about assisting the neighboring country.\n\nSmoke causes air travel problems in NYC\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration had halted all inbound flights to New York's LaGuardia airport early Wednesday afternoon due to the wildfire smoke, but lifted that restriction by late afternoon. However, delays remained at the airport.\n\nMeanwhile, at Newark's Liberty Airport, the airport reported that low visibility was leading to a ground stop for some arriving flights.\n\nThe FAA also said the extreme wildfire smoke haze lingering over the Northeast U.S. due to Canadian wildfires could delay flights through Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., CNN reported.\n\nNortheastern U.S. residents urged to limit outdoor activities\n\nAmong parts of the northeast, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control issued a Code Red Air Quality Alert Wednesday that will be in effect across the state through Thursday.\n\nAnd neighboring states, including Pennsylvania and New Jersey, will be under a Code Orange, according to WPVI-TV. The alerts could change as the smoke passes through the northeast region.\n\nBut for now, experts including Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Cheryl Bettigole told the station Wednesday that residents should try limiting their outdoor exposure.\n\n\"These are very very fine particulates that can be breathed very deep into the lungs, and they can do damage to the lung,\" Bettigole said. \"It can sometimes get into your bloodstream.\"\n\nA similar warning was heeded in the Washington, D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area, said Hannah Winnant, deputy director of the Arlington County Emergency Management, to WJLA-TV on Wednesday.\n\nWinnant advised residents to stay home if possible.\n\n\"People who are more at risk for poor air quality, for example, people with asthma, the elderly or very young children should absolutely consider staying inside,\" Winnant told the station. \"But we advise this for everyone.\"\n\nWildfire, smoke map for US, Canada\n\nBrownish haze descends on New York City\n\nHazy skies blanketed New York on Wednesday afternoon as smoke permeated the city’s air. For some New Yorkers, the poor air quality meant the return of masks and a flashback to the pandemic era.\n\nFrom Brooklyn’s Williamsburg neighborhood, where the Manhattan skyline is usually easily seen, the towers were barely visible through the brown haze. It seemed more like a foggy morning than an early June afternoon.\n\nMikael Haxby, 43, was walking his dog toward the waterfront, a medical facemask strapped tight over his mouth and nose. He said he had a burning feeling in his throat. “I’m somewhat used to wearing the mask,\" he said. \"It’s more just like the air quality is bad.” He said his child would have recess inside Wednesday, as all city schools had announced.\n\nPlenty of others went maskless, however, and some were donning the “chin strap” former Gov. Andrew Cuomo once chided during his daily pandemic press conferences.\n\nAmid the haze, public gathering spots sat mostly empty. A popular outdoor brunch restaurant, usually bustling even on a weekday, looked deserted. McCarren Park, home to the neighborhood track, had only a few joggers.\n\n\"I was actually coughing,” Deborah Gross, 29, said, from behind her white N-95 mask. She was late to meet a friend because she had to stop into a drug store to buy a mask, a move that reminded her of riding out the pandemic in the city. “I saw people wearing masks on the street,\" she said, \"and I was like, 'Whoa, throwback.’”\n\n— Anna Kaufman\n\nHow long will the poor air quality last?\n\nThe weather service said the wind trajectory that allowed smoke and hazy conditions to be seen in the New York City area could continue for the next few days.\n\nThe smoky air will then work its way west over the next couple of days, AccuWeather said.\n\n“On Thursday and Friday, the worst smoke and related air quality is expected to shift west across the Great Lakes and parts of Ohio Valley and interior Northeast including the cities of Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Detroit,\" said AccuWeather director of forecasting operations Dan DePodwin.\n\nWhat are air quality alerts?\n\nAir quality alerts are indicators the air is unsafe to breathe for certain people. Alerts are triggered by a number of factors, including the detection of fine-particle pollution — known as “PM 2.5” — which can irritate the lungs.\n\nPollution is detected by a system of monitors on the ground “constantly taking measurements of the amount of chemicals and particles in the air,” said Susan Anenberg, professor and department chair of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University.\n\n'Impossible ... to escape it' for people experiencing homelessness\n\nAs much of the Northeast is blanketed in a haze of smoke drifting down from hundreds of Canadian wildfires, people are being told to stay inside as much as possible on Wednesday.\n\nThat’s not so easy for people experiencing homelessness, advocates say.\n\n“For our neighbors living outside, it's impossible for them to escape it,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, senior manager for policy and advocacy at the nonprofit Miriam’s Kitchen in the nation’s capital.\n\nSome of the cities most impacted by unhealthy air quality from the fires also see some of the highest rates of homelessness in the country.\n\nParts of New York City and Washington, D.C., hovered between a red and purple air quality designation during the day, according to airnow.gov. That means the air is unhealthy for the general population, and people are recommended to reduce physical activity and consider going indoors. School children were kept inside for recess. Anyone with additional health risks should move all their activities indoors, officials said.\n\n“There are hundreds of our neighbors who don't have a choice but to stay outside, which must compel us to end homelessness and ensure that everyone has the housing that they need to thrive,” Rabinowitz said.\n\n— Jeanine Santucci\n\n'I can taste the air'\n\nFolks across the eastern U.S. and in Canada were coping as best as possible with the smoke-filled air. “I can taste the air,” Dr. Ken Strumpf said in a Facebook post from Syracuse, New York, which was enveloped in an amber pall. The smoke, he later said by phone, even made him a bit dizzy.\n\nIn Baltimore, where officials warned residents to stay indoors when possible, Debbie Funk sported a blue surgical mask as she and husband, Jack Hughes, took their daily walk. “I walked outside this morning and it was like a waft of smoke,” said Funk, who said the couple had considered skipping the walk but wanted some exercise.\n\nIn Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Zachary Kamel said, “the smoke was insane yesterday. I had to close my window because the fresh air just smelled like campfire.\"\n\nUS air quality index map\n\nMore:Photos show eerie hazy skylines, glowing sunrises across US from Canada wildfires\n\nContributing: Thao Nguyen and Adrianna Rodriguez, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/28/superstorm-art-key-west-fantasy-fest-pine-cone-plan-news-around-states/40450385/", "title": "Superstorm art, Key West Fantasy Fest: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Work is beginning on a business park that promoters say could mean about 1,200 jobs east of downtown. Officials held a groundbreaking Thursday for Grand River Technology Park, which will be located off Interstate 20 beside Barber Motorsports Park near Leeds. The project is planned as a regional site for research, development and light manufacturing. It’s also being billed for tourism, as the race track is nearby, and the Southern Museum of Flight plans to relocate there. Al.com reports the park is being funded in part by a $6 million grant from an Alabama Labor Department program to use abandoned mine sites. The park will reclaim about 105 acres of undeveloped land surrounding several old coal mining areas in eastern Jefferson County.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has extended its deadline to review numerous comments submitted for a draft environmental review of the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. Assistant Secretary of the Army R.D. James extended Thursday’s deadline to Feb. 28 to consider comments, including those from the Environmental Protection Agency, and to draft a preliminary final environmental impact statement. In a letter to the EPA, James says the Corps, the EPA and others will meet soon to resolve outstanding issues related to the proposed gold and copper mine. The new deadline reflects EPA’s 30-day request to review the draft statements and to consult with the Corps as they develop final versions.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A woman who teaches third graders from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is the first Native American to be named the Arizona Education Foundation’s teacher of the year. Lynette Stant teaches at Salt River Elementary, a Bureau of Indian Education school located in the community near Scottsdale. Stant’s recognition as Arizona’s top teacher was announced Thursday. A member of the Navajo Nation, she’s the first Native American to receive the recognition in the award’s 37-year history. The teacher says she attended a small reservation school in New Mexico during her primary years. Stant has been teaching at the Salt River school for 16 years. It has 19 teachers and about 330 students.\n\nArkansas\n\nYellville: Officials say a hunter died after he was attacked by a deer that he’d shot and believed to be dead. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens says 66-year-old Thomas Alexander shot a buck with a muzzleloader while hunting Tuesday near Yellville, an area in the Ozark Mountains about 105 miles north of Little Rock. Stephens tells Springfield, Missouri, television station KY3 the buck attacked Alexander when the hunter approached the animal to see if it was dead. He says Alexander, who suffered multiple puncture wounds, later died at a hospital. Stephens says it’s not clear how long Alexander waited before checking on the deer, but that the agency recommends waiting at least 30 minutes before approaching.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWestminster: The remains of 81 South Vietnamese soldiers shot down over Vietnam in 1965 have been interred at Southern California’s Westminster Memorial Park. Richard Spencer, secretary of the U.S. Navy, joined local officials for a procession and ceremony Saturday just outside Little Saigon in Orange County. The airborne soldiers of the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam were shot down in a remote area along with four American service members. The remains, which were commingled, were recovered in 1974 and eventually shipped to the U.S. The Americans were identified thanks to DNA technology. Efforts to return the other remains to Vietnam failed, so officials decided to give the unknown South Vietnamese soldiers a final resting place in the U.S. Orange County is home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A doctor fired by a Christian hospital company after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to hasten his death has a new job with a community health center. The Denver Post reports Dr. Barbara Morris, a geriatrician, has accepted a job with Stride Community Health Center in Lakewood. Stride officials say she will start in February. Morris was fired from St. Anthony Hospital in August after she and a patient filed a legal case challenging Centura Health’s policy against physician aid-in-dying. Centura was formed by Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist health care ministries. Colorado voters legalized physician aid-in-dying in 2016. The law forbids limiting a physican’s medical judgment on the issue, but the hospitals argue Colorado law can’t interfere with a religious organization carrying out its mission.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is considering turning five residential streets into what it’s calling “bicycle boulevards.” The Hartford Courant reports the city will hold public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss repurposing the roads for use mostly by bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Vehicle traffic would not be blocked on the streets but would be discouraged through signage. Similar streets have been set up in more than 10 states across the country and are sometimes referred to as “neighborways” or “neighborhood greenways.” The “bike boulevards” would be paid for with a $100,000, private Made to Move grant, an initiative between Degree Deodorant and Blue Zones LLC, founded by author Dan Buettner.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The City Council violated state law when it barred a man from speaking at one of its public meetings last month, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Friday in an opinion. Dion Wilson was banned from speaking at the Sept. 19 meeting after being accused by City Council President Hanifa Shabazz of disrupting two meetings by yelling after she prevented him from speaking during the public comment portion, noting the use of profanity. Shabazz said she will ensure that City Council meetings comply with all regulations. The Justice Department’s decision did not touch on Wilson’s Oct. 2 arrest, in which he was charged with harassment and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Donald Trump’s company is exploring the sale of its Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, which has been at the center of three years of ethics complaints and lawsuits accusing him of trying to profit off the presidency. The Trump Organization said in a statement Friday that it will consider offers to buy it out of a 60-year lease of the building partly because “people are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel.” The Trump International Hotel has been a magnet for lobbyists and diplomats looking to curry favor with the Trump administration. In Trump’s latest financial disclosure, the opulent hotel built from the Old Post Office building just steps from the White House generated nearly $41 million, up less than half a million from last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The often-decadent Fantasy Fest wrapped up over the weekend, bringing flair to this island town. At Wednesday evening’s family friendly Pet Masquerade, entrants included costumed dogs, cats and a tortoise carrying a plush rabbit themed “The Tortoise and the Hare,” drawing inspiration from the fable of the same name. The overall winner was Diana Benton of Titusville, Florida, who dressed her two cats as country artists Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, subscribing to the festival’s musical theme of “In Tune But ... Off Key.” Other highlights included Friday afternoon’s masquerade march and a parade with floats and flamboyantly costumed marching groups. Saturday night’s parade was expected to draw some 60,000 revelers. The 10-day festival ended Sunday after a children’s carnival and an afternoon dance party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Overall grades for the state’s schools fell in the 2018-2019 school year, with two state leaders repeating their call to overhaul grading methods. The typical school statewide scored 75.9 points on a 100-point scale, down from 76.6 points last year. Performance rose in high schools but fell slightly in elementary schools and more broadly in middle schools. Georgia’s system seeks to grade schools on student content mastery, academic progress and readiness, whether underperforming groups are closing gaps, and whether high school students graduate on time. State officials say scores fell because of lower scores on progress and closing gaps. State Superintendent Richard Woods and Gov. Brian Kemp say they want changes, with Woods calling for less reliance on standardized test scores.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge says a 93-year-old Native Hawaiian heiress doesn’t need a guardian to take care of her but is ordering a hearing to determine whether she needs a conservator to manage her $215 million trust. Abigail Kawananakoa’s wealth has been tied up in a legal battle since her 2017 stroke. She’s considered a princess because she’s a descendant of the family that ruled Hawaii before the kingdom’s 1893 overthrow. Board members of her foundation and ex-employees say her wife is manipulating her. Lawyers for the couple dispute that. Native Hawaiians have been watching the case because they’re concerned about the fate of the foundation she set up to benefit Hawaiians. The couple’s lawyers said Friday that Kawananakoa should be able to do what she wants with her money.\n\nIdaho\n\nChallis: Officials say they plan to use a helicopter to capture 365 wild horses in central Idaho in early November to reduce the number of horses to about 185. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in a news release Friday says the roundup in the Challis Herd Management Area near the town of Challis will begin on or about Nov. 5 and take up to nine days. The agency says balancing herd size with what the 260-square-mile management area can support will help protect habitat for wildlife species such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, mule deer and elk. The agency says mares released back into the management area will be treated with fertility control. About 240 horses not released back into the wild will be transported to the Bruneau Wild Horse Off-Range Corral facility southeast of Boise for adoption.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum has returned 42 culturally significant items to representatives of two Aboriginal communities in Australia. A University of Chicago anthropologist who worked in Australia to record indigenous languages collected the items between 1929 and 1931. They were transferred to the museum in 1942. The State Journal-Register reports that an Australian delegation received the artifacts Wednesday during a ceremony at the Illinois State Museum’s Research and Collections Center in Springfield. Brooke Morgan, the museum’s curator of anthropology, said the items returned include secret, sacred, secular and ceremonial objects. They will be returned to Aranda and Bardi Jawi communities in Australia. Morgan said the items will be used in Australia to “revitalize cultural practices” to teach young generations how to make these traditional artifacts.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A northern Indiana airport’s parking ramp for aircraft will undergo a half-million-dollar repaving job after two jets sank into the asphalt over the summer. City attorney Lawrence Meteiver says the ramp was installed at the Elkhart Municipal Airport last year by the city at a cost of about $50,000. Indiana Flight Center President Brett Zierle says a 30,000-pound Bombardier Challenger and a 15,500-pound Cessna Citation XLS sank into the asphalt ramp in June on days when the temperature reached only into the 70s. He says the asphalt is soft and not capable of supporting the weight of those aircraft. The Elkhart Truth reports that Meteiver says an asphalt mix recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration will be installed after this winter at a cost of about $565,000.\n\nIowa\n\nKnoxville: A woman has died after an explosion at a gender reveal party created debris that hit her. The Marion County Sheriff’s office says the explosion happened at a home in central Iowa about 4 p.m. Saturday during a party to announce the gender of a baby a couple is expecting. Deputies arrived at the home in Knoxville, about 40 miles southeast of Des Moines, to find a 56-year-old woman dead. Investigators determined an explosion during the gender reveal announcement caused the woman’s death. No other details about the explosion were available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators went too far by criminalizing violent language not backed up by an intent to act, the state’s highest court ruled Friday in striking down part of a law that it says violates free speech rights. The Kansas Supreme Court kept in place portions of the 2010 law banning “true threats” but struck down the provision making it a felony for someone to be “reckless” in using threatening language that makes others afraid, even if the person making the comments doesn’t intend violence. The justices said that part of the law is so broad that it might apply to the speech of political protesters, violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the state still can prosecute people who intentionally threaten of violence.\n\nKentucky\n\nBurgin: The Federal Aviation Administration says a mysterious object that seemingly dropped from the sky and damaged a man’s mobile home didn’t come from an airplane. Tommy Woosley says a heavy, nearly footlong canister-type object hit his home in Burgin, about 75 miles southeast of Louisville, two weeks ago. But the FAA and Norfolk Southern Railway say their transportation units have nothing to do with the object that lodged into the siding of his home. The National Guard and nearby Fort Campbell military base have also denied responsibility. Authorities initially believed the canister may have fallen from a plane, but an FAA spokeswoman says their investigation ruled it out. She says the agency is turning the object over to the Mercer County Sheriff’s Office for further investigation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Former Mayor Mitch Landrieu is tackling the race issue, starting with a report called “Divided by Design.” The report released Friday is based on surveys and interviews with people in in 28 communities in 13 Southern states. It touts efforts to bridge racial gaps. But it also says segregation and inequality remain major barriers to advancement for many. And it notes widespread, conflicting views on racism among African Americans, Latinos and whites. When Landrieu was mayor, he removed four Jim Crow-era monuments from the New Orleans landscape, including statues of three Confederate icons. This report is the first project of the E Pluribus Unum Fund, which Landrieu launched after leaving office in May 2018. It calls for cultivating courageous leaders who can build common ground.\n\nMaine\n\nWest Gardiner: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills says a new, fast-charging station for electric cars and incentives for more of them will help break fossil fuel companies’ “stranglehold” over Mainers’ wallets. Mills on Friday unveiled the new charging station at the Maine Turnpike plaza in West Gardiner, saying it was funded through federal Volkswagen settlement money awarded to the state’s Department of Transportation. Mills also says 23 municipalities will receive incentives to install 47 new charging stations across the state for public use. It’s part of a larger effort to boost the charging infrastructure for electric cars. Mills says charging stations make electric cars a reality for more people, help people save money on fuel and protect the environment. She calls it a “hat-trick for Maine.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBerlin: A 14-year-old girl has adopted all 75 ponies from the Maryland herd of Assateague Island ponies. Zoe Newman this month became the first person ever to foster every horse in the herd. The adoptions, which have cost Zoe and her mother more than $3,000 so far, are symbolic and provide the Assateague Island National Seashore with education and herd management funds. Zoe and her mother, Sam Newman, often get up at 4 a.m. to make the three-hour drive from their Lexington Park home to get to the park by sunrise. They’ve visited about 30 times over the past few years. Zoe first adopted an Assateague pony when she was 10 years old and used her savings on a chestnut pinto named Annie Laurie.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A new study is recommending state officials address gambling addiction in Asian American communities. Researchers with the University of Massachusetts-Boston presented to the state’s Gaming Commission last week the results of a state-funded study in Boston’s Chinatown. The study found Chinatown residents who frequently visited casinos in the region did so to relieve stress from their low-wage jobs or in the hopes of escaping poverty. Researchers also found study participants were drawn to casinos because of gambling coupons, meal deals, bus rides and other casino promotions targeting Asian communities. The researchers recommend the state develop “culturally tailored” public health campaigns and gambling counseling services. They also recommend launching a broader study encompassing Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese communities in Quincy, Lowell, Malden and Worcester.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A study has found few of the state’s residents are taking advantage of a legal option that allows people to erase their criminal convictions, even though an expungement can open doors to housing, student loans and employment. A University of Michigan law school study estimates just 6.5% of people who meet the requirements end up having their convictions set aside within five years of becoming eligible. Attorneys and law students volunteered their time last week at a free clinic in Lansing to educate more than 100 people on how to clear their records. The University of Detroit Mercy School of Law is using a $20,000 grant from the Michigan State Bar Foundation to host a series of free clinics around the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A homeless man who pleaded guilty to starting a fire that destroyed a 117-year-old synagogue has been sentenced to three months in jail and 192 hours of community service. KTTC-TV reports 36-year-old Matthew Amiot was sentenced Friday. He pleaded guilty last month to negligent fire charges. Amiot received credit for the 36 days he has already served in jail. The fire destroyed the Adas Israel Synagogue in Duluth on Sept. 9. Authorities say Amiot used a lighter to ignite combustible materials outside the main building, near a separate religious structure called a sukkah. Amiot told police he tried to spit on the fire to put it out and walked away when that didn’t work. Police don’t believe the fire was a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nTaylor: The site of an elementary school that served black children during segregation is set to become a park. The Oxford Eagle reports the plans for the park at the site of Weems Elementary were approved last week by the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors. The supervisors approved demolition of the school in May 2018 after a fire damaged most of the structure. A $1-per-year lease was approved with the newly formed nonprofit group Taylor Park Recreation, which will raise money for park construction. Throughout the 1960s, Weems taught black students between first and eighth grades. The state’s public schools were officially integrated in 1970, leading many such schools to shutter.\n\nMissouri\n\nSparta: The mayor of this tiny town says its hand-activated tornado warning siren needs to be retired. Mayor Jenni Davis is the only person in the town of 1,900 residents authorized to activate the tornado siren. The problem with the odd and antiquated system became evident early Monday when a twister was approaching town. Davis wanted to get downtown to flip the switch activating the siren, but a tree blocked her path. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Some towns are turning away from tornado warning sirens because cellphone apps and other technology that alert to approaching storms are increasingly common. But some experts say outdoor sirens still serve a purpose. Davis would like to replace the old siren, but the cost of up to $50,000 is more than the city can afford. A congressman’s office is seeking grant money to help.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Crews have completed the two-year, nearly $9 million effort of reconstructing the historic Sperry Chalet in Glacier National Park after it was gutted by a wildfire. Project Manager Travis Neil of Dick Anderson Construction tells the Hungry Horse News that the crews will return next year to finish some minor tasks to help the National Park Service to get the chalet opened for next summer. The 105-year-old wood and stone dormitory located in a remote area of the park burned when embers from a wildfire rained down on it Aug. 31, 2017. All that remained was the building’s stone shell. Kevin Warrington of Belton Chalets, which operates the chalet, said Sperry Chalet will take reservations on Jan. 13, 2020, for the summer season.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A career military man and former superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy was chosen Friday as the top candidate to become the next president of the University of Nebraska system. The university Board of Regents voted unanimously to nominate Walter “Ted” Carter Jr. as their priority candidate. Carter is a retired Navy vice admiral and served as superintendent of his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, from 2014 until this year. “Ted’s character and integrity are second to none,” said University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, of Columbus, who led the search. “He has a proven focus on the success and well-being of students, faculty and staff. He has a deep appreciation for the role and mission of higher education. And is a public servant in every sense of the word.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Police say a woman who was angered when she was kicked out of an area casino intentionally drove her motorhome into the building, injuring a custodian. North Las Vegas Police spokesman Eric Leavitt says the 50-year-old woman was ejected from the Cannery casino Friday morning and drove her Winnebago into the building. Leavitt says the woman hit a 66-year-old custodial worker outside the building. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the worker was critically injured but is expected to survive. Leavitt told KVVU-TV the woman kept hitting the gas, and her vehicle was stuck in the building’s entrance. Employees had to remove the woman to get her to stop. Leavitt says police who were already at the casino arrested the woman. Her identity was not immediately released.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampstead: Parents and other visitors to schools in the town are no longer allowed to bring guns onto school property. The Eagle Tribune reports the School Board unanimously approved a policy prohibiting anyone other than law enforcement and school resource officers from bringing guns on campus during school hours and during school-sponsored activities. The district already had rules against students and staff carrying firearms. School board member Karen Yasenka said the policy protects students and staff without infringing on anyone’s rights. The Legislature passed a bill this year that would have banned most guns from school grounds statewide, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed it.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Long Branch: The personal stories of people who survived Superstorm Sandy are an integral part of a new art exhibit remembering the deadly storm and the devastation it caused seven years ago. The Monmouth University exhibit also includes an obelisk made from slices from trees that fell during the storm, with each inch representing 2,703 lost housing units. There are hanging posters resembling beach towels that present Sandy-related data in easy-to-grasp visual terms. A “climate shelter,” for which all the trappings of a home that would normally be on the inside are on the outside, symbolizes the huge mounds of sodden possessions that became garbage.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlong the Burnt Mesa Trail: Conservationists and forestry experts are scouring the American Southwest, hoping to gather as many ponderosa pine cones as possible to give nature a hand in restoring fire-scarred landscapes. The goal: 1 million seeds. It might sound lofty, but those helping with the project are looking to take advantage of a rare bumper crop this fall that has resulted from back-to-back summer and winter seasons of much-needed rain and snow. It takes time to find the patches of trees that will yield the most seeds. One spot is a mesa in northern New Mexico that overlooks vast expanses of rugged terrain that has seen its share of fire over the last two decades. With drought and the severity of wildfires on the rise, scientists say seed collection and reforestation are becoming more important across the West.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are flocking to greet a new arrival to the city – Wegmans grocery store. The popular regional chain officially opened its first New York City outpost Sunday, a 74,000-square-foot store at the Brooklyn Navy Yard with more than 500 employees. Despite the rain, crowds turned out Sunday to take a look at a selection the company says includes almost 50,000 items. Aside from groceries, the store offers a range of food options, including sushi, pizza and buffet bars, and has a bar serving alcohol in the cafe. The new Brooklyn outpost is the 101st store for Wegmans, which was founded over a century ago in Rochester, New York, and is still family-owned.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRodanthe: Researchers say they’re seeing a growing number of great white sharks off the coast of the state’s Outer Banks. The Raleigh News & Observer reports that four sharks with tracking devices have “pinged” in recent days. The sharks are being tracked by researchers with the organization Ocearch, which said on Twitter that a shark named Ironbound was among the sharks that were traveling near the Outer Banks community of Corolla and moving down the coast toward Rodanthe. Ironbound is a 12-foot, 4-inch male great white who weighs about 1,000 pounds. The organization is tracking three other male great white sharks between 10 and 12 feet in length. Great white sharks are known to swim off the southeastern United States coast in the winter.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Democrats in the state Senate have joined the call for a senator to resign his leadership position in the wake of his Facebook posts targeting a Muslim U.S. congresswoman from Minnesota. The Bismarck Tribune reports Democratic senators wrote a letter Thursday to Sen. Oley Larsen, a Minot Republican, asking that he relinquish his position as president pro tempore. Their letter came a day after Larsen sent an email to his fellow senators, asking to “gauge each of your stance” on his leadership role. Last week Larsen posted a long-debunked photo that purports to show Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., holding a weapon at an al-Qaida training camp. The image actually shows a female Somali army recruit at a Mogadishu military training campus in 1978, four years before Omar was born in 1982.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Thousands of acres in eastern Ohio that the state says it’s buying to promote recreation and conservation may be drilled for oil and natural gas. The Columbus Dispatch reports a draft purchase agreement obtained by the newspaper shows American Electric Power will retain subsurface rights to more than 31,000 acres it’s selling to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for $47 million. The document states AEP will have the continuing right to drill. AEP spokesman Scott Blake says no active fracking is underway on the land. He says the power company will work with the state to coordinate that activity if the situation changes. Natural Resources Department spokeswoman Sarah Wickham says the state is “reasonably certain” the property includes active wells.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A second police officer has testified that an unarmed man wasn’t a threat when a fellow officer fatally shot him after the victim called 911 threatening suicide. Keith Sweeney is charged with murder in the 2017 killing of 29-year-old Dustin Pigeon, who was apparently trying to set himself on fire with lighter fluid when police arrived. The Oklahoman reports that Officer Troy Nitzky testified Friday that he didn’t see Pigeon as a threat. Sgt. Erik Howell testified Thursday that Pigeon didn’t have a gun or a knife and that he didn’t “observe any threatening acts.” Defense attorney Gary James has said that Sweeney didn’t know Pigeon was unarmed because the other officers didn’t notify him by radio and that Sweeney made the proper decision “based on the information he was given.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s LGBTQ community has updated rights to equal treatment under an executive order signed by Gov. Kate Brown. America’s first openly bisexual governor said a 1987 executive order needed to be updated to reflect current law and understandings about sexual orientation and gender identity. The executive order, signed Friday, prohibits state agencies from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It directs state agencies to treat everyone consistent with their gender identity and to modify forms to add a third option – “nonbinary/other” – in addition to “male” and “female.” A state agency must also adopt statewide policies to expand access to appropriate restrooms and to accommodate state employees and the public who are transgender, nonbinary or gender nonconforming.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An internal review of the state’s parole system spurred by five parolees getting charged in quick succession with homicide is, in theory, acknowledging a long-standing complaint of parole agents. It asks lawmakers to update a 2012 law and add a trigger for an automatic six-month to one-year jail sentence for a parolee who continually ignores parole conditions, such as going to treatment or counseling. The 2012 law already has five such triggers, including threatening behavior or possession of a weapon. Law enforcement groups largely welcomed the acknowledgement from the state Department of Corrections. The county district attorneys association calls it a “significant recognition.” Parole agents, however, were skeptical it’ll change a system they say has stripped them of discretion to pull a potentially dangerous parolee off the street.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: A memorial was dedicated over the weekend for 97 firefighters who have died in the line of duty in the state since the 1800s. North Kingstown Fire Chief Scott Kettelle says firefighters raised more than $300,000 for the memorial dedicated Saturday at the state Fire Training Academy. Construction has taken about a year. The Providence Journal reports firefighters who have died since recordkeeping began in the 1800s are being commemorated for their sacrifice. Kettelle says he and other organizers hope the event can become an annual tradition. The fire department plans to continue adding more names with fundraising through the sale of engraved paving bricks. The memorial is open to the public.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is again requiring all sex offenders to stay inside with their outside lights off and not give out trick-or-treat candy on Halloween. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services spokesman Pete O’Boyle said the requirement to stay inside runs from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. statewide Oct. 31. O’Boyle says some counties will require all sex offenders to go to a central location to be supervised for several hours on Halloween. O’Boyle said in a statement that agents will be checking on offenders in all 46 South Carolina counties. Last year, agents checked more than 350 homes and made more than 150 phone calls.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Transportation Commission has passed rules for truck platooning. The practice links two or more trucks in a convoy, using connected technology and automated driving support systems. Drivers are still behind the wheel of the trucks, but when synced, the vehicles behind the leader adapt to changes in movement with little or no action from the drivers. KELO-TV reports truck companies need special permits from the Department of Public Safety to platoon. The commission is allowing the practice only on South Dakota’s interstates, except in certain weather conditions and during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee will consider the rules Nov. 4. Twenty-nine states now allow truck platooning, including all of South Dakota’s neighbors.\n\nTennessee\n\nErwin: The town is preparing to auction off a herd of brightly painted elephant statues that recall a dark day in local history. The Johnson City Press reports the auction is part of a community initiative called the Erwin Elephant Revival. It honors a circus elephant named Mary who was hanged from a derrick in Erwin’s railyard in 1916 after she killed her trainer. The Elephant Revival lets residents reflect on the past while raising money for the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald. The statues are getting added attention this year after local high school students won a National Public Radio competition for their podcast on the initiative. The silent auction takes place Monday through Friday at Erwin Town Hall. More information is available online.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: A charity that trains service dogs for disabled veterans has commissioned a statue of the late George H.W. Bush’s service dog for the 41st president’s library. America’s VetDogs has commissioned sculptor Susan Bahary to create the bronze statue of Sully for placement in the east wing of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University. VetDogs President John Miller says the statue will depict Sully sitting with his leash in his mouth, the “retrieve” task VetDogs trains its dogs to perform. It will show Sully wearing his America’s VetDogs vest with the Great Seal of the United States on its back. The yellow Labrador golden retriever assisted the former president for the last six months of his life before Bush’s death last November at age 94.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A rule that would have allowed ATVs on certain roads in the five national parks in the state has been rescinded by the National Park Service. The agency said in a news release Friday that it changed its mind after further consultation with Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt, whose agency includes the National Park Service. The agency didn’t provide reasons for the reversal. The rule would have gone into effect Nov. 1 to conform to a state law that allows any “street-legal” vehicle on state and county roads. Instead, a long-standing ban on ATVs in parks will remain. Ashley Korenblat, an advocate for preserving public lands and CEO of Western Spirit Cycling in Moab, Utah, applauded a move she said will ensure ATVs aren’t crammed into already congested national parks.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: The town lost almost $250,000 in an email scam. A report released by Norwich details how town Finance Director Donna Flies ignored instructions to stop unauthorized payments from municipal accounts. Town Treasurer Cheryl Lindberg says she confronted Flies, telling her that payments from Norwich accounts require select board approval. Authorities say Flies assumed emails requesting large sums of money were from her boss, Town Manager Herb Durfee. Flies told investigators the only thing she did wrong was to make “stupid mistakes.” Valley News reports the report blames both Flies for failing to detect the scam and town officials for failing to confront her. No one’s been charged with a crime. Officials say $79,765 was returned by Comerica Bank.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: A poet and civil rights activist from the city will be honored in the U.S. Postal Service’s 2020 Forever stamp series. Anne Spencer, who died in 1975, is included in the recently unveiled “Voices of the Harlem Renaissance” series. In a news release, the USPS says the set of 20 stamps pays homage to “one of the great artistic and literary movements in American history.” The News & Advance reports that Spencer enrolled at what’s now the Virginia University of Lynchburg at 11 years old when she was barely literate and graduated six years later as valedictorian. She went on to become a poet, librarian, and contemporary of African-American artists and political leaders. Spencer also helped found the Lynchburg chapter of the NAACP in 1918.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Sound Transit board members have abandoned ideas for a $450 million tunnel into the city’s historic central Ballard, a $200 million bored tunnel through West Seattle’s Pigeon Point neighborhood, and a fully elevated trackway in Sodo that would have blocked light-rail travel during construction. The Seattle Times reports cheaper options that serve the same number of passengers and will still cost hundreds of millions of dollars will now gain momentum during environmental studies. Politicians on the 18-member board have entertained dozens of alignment concepts since 2016, when voters passed the $54 billion ST3 tax measure to expand regional rail and bus services. The agency promised West Seattle stations in 2030 and stations from south downtown to Seattle Center and Ballard by 2035.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Inmates in state prisons now have access to specially designed tablet computers. The Register-Herald reports the tablets are provided at no cost to taxpayers by Global Tel Link through its inmate banking services contract with the prison system. The tablets give the prisoners access to email, video visitation, electronic books, music, games and movies. They lack a normal internet browser but do allow access to select websites, including educational and career sites. All apps and websites are approved by the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The devices will soon help inmates submit requests, file grievances and order from the facility commissary. West Virginia’s tablet program began as a pilot at the Saint Mary’s Correctional Center last year. Then-Superintendent Patrick Mirandy said he saw the tablets improve facility safety.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross is retiring. The 71-year-old Cross said Friday that he plans to retire once a new president is selected. Cross has served as UW’s president since February 2014. He previously served three years as chancellor of UW Colleges and UW-Extension and has spent more than four decades in higher education, previously working in Minnesota and Michigan. He served three years in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Cross says serving as UW president has been the most rewarding work of his life. UW Board of Regents President Andrew Petersen says in a statement that Cross has been tireless in leading the system with vision and integrity. He says Cross stabilized the system at a time of legislative skepticism and financial challenges.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation reports 28 moose were killed on roads in Teton County from May 2018 through April 2019. It’s the highest moose toll since 33 were killed from May 2010 through April 2011. Eight were killed along Moose-Wilson Road. The foundation’s executive director, Jon Mobeck, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide on Friday that the overall wildlife toll of 267 animals reported hit was the fifth-highest since the foundation started keeping tabs in 1990. Elk collisions totaled 34 in the most recent report, down from the 40s in the previous two years. The foundation’s report does not include animals found dead and reported hit in Grand Teton National Park, where elk and moose collisions increased from 2017 to 2018.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2019/07/19/how-delaware-state-fair-officials-check-food-ride-safety/1750795001/", "title": "How Delaware State Fair officials check food, ride safety", "text": "UPDATE: Read the inspection reports for the rides and food vendors at the bottom of this article.\n\nThis week the Delaware State Fair will once again welcome hundreds of thousands of fairgoers to central Delaware, melding the sights and smells of farming, fun and fried food for 10 days for the 100th year in a row.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/connections/2018/04/26/volunteer-firefighters-needed-recruitny/543534002/", "title": "Why New York volunteer fire services need your help", "text": "Tom Vail was 26 when he joined the Afton Hose Co. Inc. in 1966. A local merchant and World War II veteran who volunteered with the fire department approached him one day and asked him to join, so he did.\n\nIt was a different time back then, says Vail, now 78.\n\n\"When someone asked you to do something you didn't say no,\" he said.\n\nAnd in a half century of service to the fire department, Vail, who serves as treasurer, has never thought of quitting.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to it, but there's also a lot of benefits.\"\n\nHe's watched the service evolve, from the days when he'd hear the loud siren while at work at an Afton bank, rush out to a scene in his dress slacks and shoes and send the fire department his dry cleaning bill. Today, pagers alert volunteers to calls, and they all have a load of turnout gear to strap on before they head to the variety of emergencies they respond to throughout the year: medical calls, fires, fallen wires and car accidents among them. Still he serves.\n\n\"I've just always lived right here in the village,\" he said, \"and had a good idea of how badly we needed volunteers.\"\n\nMore:Newark Valley man, 76, was known to many as 'Firefighter Denny'\n\nThat's perhaps more true now than ever, when a fire call typically goes out to several departments at once to ensure there are enough people to respond to it and Afton's department includes about 15 active firefighters — Vail can remember when there was a waiting list of people eyeing a spot on their roster of 60.\n\nThe situation is similar in most area fire departments, and on Saturday and Sunday, 345 fire stations across New York will open their bay doors to the community for RecruitNY, an annual event collaboratively established in 2011 by the Fireman's Association of the State of New York, New York State Association of Fire Chiefs, Association of Fire Districts of New York State, Volunteer Fire Police Association of the State of New York and County Fire Coordinators Association of the State of New York to address volunteer departments' critical need for more volunteers.\n\nMore:Retired Johnson City firefighter, 69, was 'selfless giver,' craftsman\n\n\"They're our neighbors, they're our community members, they're the people you see in church, they're the people that work in your business,\" said Broome County Executive Jason Garnar in a press conference streamed live on Facebook April 20. \"They answer the call anytime.\"\n\nAccording to the National Volunteer Fire Council, the number of firefighter volunteers has declined by about 12 percent since 1984, while call volume has tripled.\n\nThroughout RecruitNY weekend, volunteer firefighters at 33 stations in Broome, Chenango, Chemung, Cortland, Delaware, Otsego, Steuben, Tioga and Tompkins counties will conduct firehouse tours, demonstrations and activities, as well as to give those interested in fire service an opportunity to speak with active members.\n\n\"There's a lot of types of jobs available,\" said Rob Brady, president of the Broome County Firefighters Association. \"You don't have to run into a burning building, there are other things that you may be able to do to give us a hand in the fire service. We need you.\"\n\nIn addition to active firefighting, volunteers can assist in other areas including photography, accounting, child care, website administration and fire education.\n\nSince RecruitNY began in 2011, the number of firefighters in the state has increased by 20,000, according to the Fireman's Association of the State of New York, bringing the total to 110,000 volunteer firefighters.\n\n\"While the numbers are getting better...it's clearly not enough,\" said Sen. Fred Akshar. \"It continues to be an issue.\"\n\nIn 2016, Brady said Broome County fire departments responded to 6,000 calls, and they varied in nature from fires, flooding, car accidents, chemical spills, medical emergencies, marine incidents, rail incidents, construction sites and house alarms.\n\nMore:Food Bank program is changing the story of hunger with Speakers Bureau\n\n\"Unfortunately today sometimes we have to tone out multiple fire departments to get the size crew we need for an emergency,\" Brady said. \"When you have a problem at your house you just want help fast.\"\n\nThere's also the heightened responsibilities Vail has seen come with newer technology. Newer equipment and advanced gear requires additional training and manpower, and though Afton's department has some volunteers in their twenties, there's also a good number in their sixties, he said.\n\n\"The requirement for service now is more demanding,\" he said. \"It's gotten to the point where the amount of training and fire calls wears people out.\"\n\nBut to those considering it, Vail says there's a great deal to benefit from as a volunteer firefighter.\n\nIn Afton, volunteers can become junior firefighters at 16, and the department's first class of five junior firefighters in the late 1980s produced three career firefighters. It's also \"nothing but good\" for colleges, employers or the military to see on a young person's resume, he said.\n\nVail was also a member of the department's EMS squad for 18 years, and said his advanced First Aid and CPR training helped him know how to respond in case there was an emergency situation in his own family.\n\nBeyond that, there's the communal aspect of being part of the fire department's team, who, in addition to responding to emergencies, host fundraisers and pasta dinners throughout the year.\n\n\"It's a commitment, there's no question about it,\" Vail said. \"You're not only doing something for the community, but it's a lot of fun too.\"\n\nFrom 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Afton, crews will set up demonstrations, have the department tanker set up along with a demonstration of the self-contained breathing apparatus firefighters used for interior firefighting. Families can enjoy hot dogs and hamburgers and children will be able to try out the hand line with firefighters, perhaps the next generation of community volunteers.​​​​\n\n\"It's a great feeling of accomplishment to help someone in need,\" Brady said. \"We need you to help us.\"\n\nIn Stories to Share, reporter Katie Sullivan spends time with the Southern Tier's most fascinating people.

It's also there to help keep his focus on a core value of his brewery.\n\nSTORY: Coming soon: Wilmington's first production brewery in 64 years\n\nSTORY: State gives Delaware alcohol-makers a high-tech push\n\nSTORY: Buses out, Lyft in for Wilmington's 38th Halloween Loop\n\n\"By naming it that, it also works to make sure we stay active with it,\" says Schatz, a homebrewer who built Volunteer behind West Main Street's Wellbeing on Main, a wellness services center that he owns with his wife, Dawn. (She owns and runs Appoquinimink Counseling Services, an outpatient mental health counseling, from the same building.)\n\n\"You can't hide from it,\" he adds. \"I'm feeling it now, but that's good because that's the pressure I want on me.\"\n\nWhile founding a brewery on the principle of volunteerism is new to Delaware, breweries helping the communities they serve isn't.\n\nJust last month, Smyrna's Blue Earl Brewing gave 10 percent of all October Sunday beer sales to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and its annual food drive benefiting the Food Bank of Delaware is up and running through Nov. 22.\n\nAlso last month, Wilmington's Iron Hill Brewery hosted Wilmington firefighters, Mayor Mike Purzycki and others to tap their Last Alarm IPA. The collaborative beer was created last year and brewed with firefighters in the aftermath of the Canby Park fire that killed three firefighters and left another with severe burns. A dollar from each pint goes to the Local 1590 International Association of Fire Fighters, the labor union representing Wilmington's firefighters.\n\nDownstate, Crooked Hammock near Lewes has raised more than $37,000 this year for various charities, including Lewes' Children's Beach House.\n\nWhether it's Bellefonte Brewing Company's upcoming events to benefit Toys for Tots, Wounded Warrior Project and The Purple Heart Foundation, Midnight Oil Brewing's work for the Children's Miracle Network Hospitals or Twin Lakes Brewing Company's support for everyone from Delaware State Parks to the Wilmington Flower Market, there's plenty of First State philanthropy in those pints.\n\nMark Carter heads Dogfish Head’s Beer & Benevolence program, which has been collaborating for years with nonprofit organizations to help foster community and advance the arts and the environment, especially.\n\nAbout 200 groups benefit annually from the program through financial sponsorships, donated beer, the Dogfish Dash and other special events. Nonprofits such as Arden's Gild Hall and the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival get free beer from Dogfish and use money from its sales to help with costs.\n\nIn addition, the entire company comes to a halt one day each spring and Dogfish's 200-plus employees volunteer for Habitat For Humanity, building homes for those in need.\n\nCarter estimates that Dogfish donates about $500,000 through all of its community-driven efforts, including the Beer & Benevolence program.\n\n\"It's really cool to see our beer all over the state and it's really cool to see that we're able to help all over the state, too,\" says Carter, who has led the department for nine years.\n\nWhile up-start Volunteer won't match the scope of Dogfish's impact anytime soon, they are making community inroads day by day.\n\nA few steps from Volunteer Brewing lives John Pickett, 69, a lifelong Middletown resident. He has watched as his neighbor Schatz worked to transform a garage into a compact brewery, first opening in August to coincide with the Middletown Olde Tyme Peach Festival.\n\nSchatz has since made about a dozen different beers at his half-barrel brewery, ranging from Summit Farms IPA (5.3% ABV) and Orange Blossom Honey Wheat (6.5% ABV) to Chocolate Stout (5.5% ABV) and Farmhouse Sorachi Ace (7.8% ABV). Four to five different flavors are usually available at a time.\n\nThe brewery, Middletown's first, has turned into a community hub of sorts, drawing long-time Middletown residents, as well as some of the fresh faces that have moved into the growing town.\n\nPickett has popped in for a beer just about every time Schatz has been open, visiting with his wife, son or daughter, often times bumping into an old acquaintance. And some of that feel-good mojo can be tracked to the brewery's mission, which has already included events with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n\"I like the idea of keeping it small,\" says Pickett, a retired school teacher. \"He's not in it for financial rewards. He's in it because he enjoys making the beer and doing things for the community, which he's adopted. He's more of a friend than a neighborhood brewer.\"\n\nThere are three maps dotted with red push pins on Volunteer's wall. One map is a detailed view of Middletown, another shows the entire state and the third features all of the United States.\n\nCustomers have been sticking a pin into their hometowns, showing where Volunteer's customers are coming from.\n\nWhile Middletown itself boasts the most patrons, the farthest someone has come is from Hawaii. The nearest visitor? Well, that just happens to be Pickett.\n\nAll the while, Schatz is working hard to remember as many first names of customers as possible, dovetailing with the community theme.\n\n\"When you think about Middletown and its history -- it was a small town and it's grown rapidly. And continues to grow,\" says Schatz, dressed in a Volunteer T-shirt and hat. \"There's a risk that the small town identity gets lost, so we wanted to try and keep a piece of that.\"\n\nHe has no real plans to grow his baby brewery, not interested in having his beers end up in liquor stores. Still, a few locally-owned restaurants may eventually have Volunteer's beer on tap. \"We want to grow as big as the community wants us to grow,\" Schatz adds.\n\nIf you haven't heard of Volunteer Brewing, don't worry. We won't make you turn in your Delaware beer credentials. Volunteer remains somewhat under the radar by choice.\n\nIt's located off West Main Street on A Street, which isn't much more than an alleyway that separates the brewery from the nearby Volunteer Hose Company of Middletown.\n\nIn fact, Volunteer Hose Company helped inspire the brewery's name.\n\nEven though the fire company was not named because it's a volunteer organization -- it's actually named Volunteer after the Wilmington-made yacht that won America's Cup in 1887 -- it was close enough for Schatz.\n\nThe brewery has done no real advertising and it's open only three days a month -- with the exact days and hours changing each month to fit Schatz's busy schedule. He's also a father of three with a full-time day job in the health insurance industry. Schatz gets help brewing from a volunteer of his own, his neighbor Kevin Penoza, the only other member of the Volunteer team.\n\nEven with an inconsistent schedule, there's usually a line forming any evening he's open. And some of the customers are now coming armed with possible volunteerism opportunities.\n\n\"I thought we'd ease into it, but people have really flocked to it,\" Schatz says. \"You have to kind of be in the know to know about it.\"\n\nUntil now, that is.\n\nContact Ryan Cormier of The News Journal at rcormier@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2863.

On the same month, they also brew their JPA IPA, releasing it Fathers Day weekend with $1 per pint going to the Pints for Prostates nonprofit.\n\nBellefonte Brewing Co. (Prices Corner): The brewery averages about two charity events each month, including Brandywine Hundred Fire Company, American Lung Association's Lung Force Walk and the Brain Injury Association of Delaware. Future events will benefit Toys for Tots, Wounded Warrior Project and The Purple Heart Foundation.\n\nBlue Earl Brewing (Smyrna): Ten percent of all Sunday beer sales in October went to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. And the brewery's annual food drive is running now until Nov. 22 to benefit the Food Bank of Delaware after collecting 1,368 pounds last year. Also, proceeds from the 50/50 raffle at each of the brewery's six outdoor events each year go to Citizens Hose Company.\n\nCrooked Hammock Brewery (Lewes). So far this year, Crooked Hammock has raised more than $37,000 for various charities, including Lewes' Children's Beach House through their annual Ashley Furio 5K and Winter Wonderfest. The brewery also runs a three-month campaign each winter benefiting a specific charity. Last year's beneficiaries were local first responders. This year's charity has not yet been announced.\n\nDew Point Brewing Co. (Yorklyn): Dew Point has participated in fundraising for nonprofits including the Delaware Food Bank, Brandywine Red Clay Creek Alliance, Hockessin Historical Society, Delaware Hospice and more.\n\nIron Hill Brewery (Wilmington): Just like last year, Iron Hill released its Last Alarm IPA, which was brewed in honor of the three firefighters who died in service battling a blaze in the city's Canby Park neighborhood: Capt. Christopher Leach, Lt. Jerry Fickes and Lt. Ardythe Hope. Firefighter Brad Speakman survived, suffering burns on 30 percent of his body. The beer was brewed with help of Wilmington firefighters, who returned to the brewery last month for the beer's most recent release. A dollar from every pint sold goes to the Wilmington Fire Fighters Association IAFF Local 1590.\n\nMidnight Oil Brewing (Newark): The brewery has participated in Preston's March For Energy and is involved with Extra Life, the gamers-centric fundraising event for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. An Extra Life beer named \"1up\" is in the works with some proceeds expected to go to Children's Miracle Network, which includes Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nTwin Lakes Brewing (Newport): Over the past year, Twin Lakes has participated in charitable events for about a dozen organizations, ranging from Delaware State Parks and Connections to the Greek Festival and the Wilmington Flower Market.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2020/06/01/exide-batteries-technology-muncie-factory/5307538002/", "title": "Exide Technologies: Timeline of building batteries in Muncie", "text": "July 1988: Exide officials announce plans to build a $10 million plant to recycle lead for batteries, expanding an Industria Centre building Exide bought that previously housed Mincon Corp., which also recycled battery lead.

In response, the manager of the local plant announces plans to conduct presentations, demonstrations and open houses for its neighbors.\n\nJune 2013: Exide files a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws, and closes or idles some of its plants elsewhere, while continuing to recycle batteries at its Muncie plant — which, as of July 2014, is the 37th largest employer in Delaware County and one of the county's top 10 manufacturing employers.\n\n2015: The federal government and Exide Technologies reject pleas from the Muncie mayor, environmental/health groups and three neighborhood associations to install $31 million in pollution-control equipment at the battery recycling facility.\n\n2015: Exide Technologies agrees to pay an $820,000 civil penalty to settle a lawsuit accusing it of violating the Clean Air Act at its Muncie lead smelter. The settlement in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis also requires Exide to spend $4 million to install state-of-the art pollution control equipment at its Industria Centre facility.\n\n2016: The Muncie Exide plant releases 160 pounds of lead into the air during 2016, an amount that falls within permitted limits.\n\n2017: A local pediatrician and the Delaware County Health Department inform state officials that Exide Technologies workers have tracked lead home on their clothing, exposing their children to the toxic metal.\n\nFeb. 20, 2017:Three explosions rock Exide's secondary lead smelter in Muncie \"when water was released from a failed welded patch in the metal afterburner water jacket above the reverbatory furnace.\" The explosions damaged the exhaust system, furnace, walls and roof of a containment building, according to IDEM. A complaint filed by IDEM in 2018 seeks a civil penalty from Exide of $3,000.\n\n2018: The Indiana Department of Environmental Management renews, without a public hearing, renews Exide's permit to operate its secondary lead smelter in Muncie for another five years. In response demonstrators marched in front of the plant.\n\nJune 2019: Purdue researchers conducting a study of people who have been exposed to lead reach out to Exide workers.\n\nJuly 2019: Environmental activist Sandi Aul calls 911 after being awakened in the middle of the night by what she called a sulfuric acid smell in her house in a neighborhood near the plant.The Muncie Fire Department is dispatched in response, but there is no evacuation. That same month, Exide reports an emergency occurrence to the state after a bird flying into an Indiana Michigan Power transformer pole on West Sixth Street knocks out power to the plant for 145 minutes, which shuts off pollution control baghouse fans. The amount of fugitive emissions of lead released during the power outage could not be estimated, the company tells the state.

We're scared that could happen again. I never want to see that happen again, but we are always prepared now.\"\n\nWhile Svolis says the dunes help a lot during storms, he isn't convinced they will always hold back the water.\n\n\"That's a real concern to me and the other business owners on the boardwalk,\" he said. \"So we are always prepared for the worst.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, one of the dunes put in place along Delmarva beaches was breached, causing flooding along Del. 1 south of Dewey Beach. While it wasn't in a populated area, it closed down the roadway for hours.\n\nAnd it made many wonder what will happen when, not if, another major storm hits.\n\nSTORY: Middletown woman charged with strangling boyfriend\n\nSTORY: Argument about veteran's service dog goes viral\n\nDuring the morning, swells combined with a high storm tide – the combined height of a daily astronomical tide and a storm surge – to break through the protective dune.\n\nThe primary coastal artery closed at about 8 a.m. between Dewey and Bethany beaches. By noon, southbound lanes and one northbound lane reopened.\n\nOvernight, two lines of dune ridges were created to prevent overwash getting through from high tide.\n\nTony Pratt, administrator for shoreline and waterway management for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, said Tuesday's storm produced more powerful waves than expected.\n\n\"They came in at a higher velocity and moved up faster across the beach and the dunes,\" he said. \"It's not what we expect. It reminds us how powerful storms can be.\"\n\nPratt said after the breach south of Dewey was repaired, crews worked throughout the day on Wednesday to find low spots in the dunes from Rehoboth Beach to Bethany Beach and used available sand to fill them in.\n\n“We closed the breach yesterday at low tide and the dune held at high tide last night and again this morning,\" Pratt said. \"At low tide today, we looked at the integrity of the system in place and determined that there are two or three areas of concern that we will try to reinforce over the next couple of days.\"\n\nPratt said DNREC officials will now keep an eye on Hurricane Maria, which despite being downgraded from a Category 5 storm to a Category 2, managed to knock out all power in Puerto Rico Wednesday.\n\nThere is still a chance Maria could make landfall on the mainland U.S.\n\nSo far, nine deaths from the storm have been confirmed – two on the French island of Guadaloupe, which was hit hard.\n\nEarlier, the small island of Dominica was slammed and seven people had been confirmed dead there.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, Maria is expected to continue on a northwest track, moving along the northeast coast of the Dominican Republic on Thursday before skirting the southern Bahamas early Friday.\n\nIt is then predicted to swing to the north into the open Atlantic and move between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda. Longer-term forecasts are less certain – Hurricane Irma swung to the west coast of Florida having been predicted to hit the east coast.\n\nCynthia Tomback has lived in Magnolia for 2½ years and went to Rehoboth Beach Wednesday to get a look at the big waves. She said what she saw wasn't the norm.\n\n\"I come to the beach about once a week in the summer. A normal day at the beach is pretty docile and there aren't too many big waves here,\" she said. \"Right now, there are a lot of big waves and the guys are going out to surf. I guess it's exciting because you don't usually get these big waves the storm is bringing in.\"\n\nTomback said when she was at Rehoboth Beach two years ago in October, it was a different picture.\n\nShe said the storm that came through produced waves that got so big, they went all the way up to the boardwalk and the dunes got washed away, as well as some of the boardwalk.\n\n\"The storm was really bad, forcing businesses to close,\" she said. \"It was intense. It was a big event. I had never seen actual waves coming up so close to buildings here. It was a little frightening.\"\n\nBefore coming to Delaware, Tomback lived in Staten Island, New York. She lived through Superstorm Sandy and saw houses at the end of her road ripped away by wind and waves. The worst, she said, was the loss of lives.\n\n\"It was a tragic event,\" she said. \"Waves are very devastating and people really don't know the power they possess. Mother Nature can do amazing things that can be devastating.\"\n\nBob Vance and his wife Bee live in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and have been coming to Delaware beaches for seven decades. They come four to five times a year, mostly in September when the crowds have thin out.\n\nBob said the difference between Tuesday and Wednesday was like night and day. Having seen [Hurricane] Joaquin come through in October 2015, he said Tuesday's storm was nothing.\n\nBut he shuddered to think what a nor'easter might have done to the dunes.\n\n\"Years ago in Ocean City, buildings were knocked down because of the waves,\" he said. \"It's been bad here a number of times. We've seen the beach reconstructed on a number of occasions here.\"\n\nTravis Michels, a Rehoboth Beach lifeguard, said Tuesday's winds and waves were an inconvenience but said they should never be underestimated.\n\nHe said the water came all the way up and past the dune fence Tuesday afternoon. He said it started to move one of the Beach Patrol's sheds, which was immediately taken off the beach.\n\n\"It's no joke. The ocean is going to do what it wants to do and we're here to see what it does and react to that,\" Michels said. \"Even when the storm passed a couple of hundred miles off the coast, it still had a major impact with the winds, and we're still dealing with those winds today.\"\n\nMichels said beach erosion shortens the beaches and makes the job of a lifeguard a little bit more difficult because it changes what is going on out in the water.\n\n\"We train for this all year, so we are ready to go,\" he said. \"This is our last week for the beach patrol. At least we are here while this storm is cruising through to make sure people do stay safe.\"\n\nMichels said they were put on alert when they heard about the dune breaking.\n\n\"Route 1 does flood quite a bit when big storms come through,\" he said. \"With the dune breaking all the way through, that's not something that normally happens. That's more common with a nor'easter that we'd see in the winter time. At the end of the summer and the start of the fall, a storm having this impact is a big deal for us.\"\n\nFuture fix\n\nIn May, Sen. Tom Carper announced the Delaware coast from Fenwick Island to Bethany Beach would be undergoing emergency beach nourishment at no cost to the state after a series of storms hit the Delaware beaches in 2015.\n\n\"If you go back to late 2015, we had a storm, Joaquin, and it came through here and did some damage, and then it was a one-two punch,\" Carper said then. \"Jonas came after that, and it just about did us in. All the work that the Army Corps had done to build up the beach and the dunes to protect us was pretty much wiped out.\"\n\nBeach replenishment is a process of pumping sand up from the ocean floor and back under the feet of tourists and locals, building up dunes to protect from when storms hit the coastline. The dunes and widened beach serve as a barrier between the coastal towns and tourism industry from the powerful waves that surge in passing storms.\n\nRehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach received a round of $11.2 million beach nourishment this past winter, while Ocean City last underwent replenishment in 2013. The Maryland town is scheduled to undergo another round during the fall of 2017, costing $4.6 million.\n\nBefore that, the most recent beach nourishment at the southern Delaware beaches came in 2013 after Superstorm Sandy hit the coast in October 2012.\n\nPratt said contract bids were accepted recently for the upcoming beach replenishment project, but it was too soon to know what company came in with the low bid.\n\nThe 2017 project is expected to cost between $15 and $22 million.\n\n\"The project will consist of replenishing dunes, crossovers, and planting grass,\" Pratt said. \"The Army Corps of Engineers is ready to repair damage caused by severe storms and is looking for work to begin in late fall.\"\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

The river can take care of itself — locals just have to pay to use it.\n\n\"It's just a place to get out to nature when you're so close to the city,\" said lifelong Wilmingtonian Sean Sweeney. \"I didn't know there was a lot of cost associated with it other than general park maintenance. I saw they redid the raceway, which was needed because the walls were falling apart and that dam never really was functioning. I use to swim in the river. I probably shouldn't haven't have, but did. I've always used the river, and I hope they always maintain it.\"\n\nThe Brandywine river winds in from southeastern Pennsylvania across the Delaware state line, and near its mouth once was the site of the New Sweden colony established in 1638. The 20-mile waterway lends its name to the Sept. 11, 1777, Battle of Brandywine, which took place in Pennsylvania and was the longest single-day engagement of the Revolutionary War.\n\nVIDEO: Water flows through icy Brandywine River\n\nSTORY: Del. test cases - When lead is in your water\n\nIts place in the region's history has been essential and sometimes frustrating, such as its role in providing water to DuPont's gunpowder mill in the 1800s but also creating 25 flood events since 1946 when records began to be kept. Today its continued usage still requires work.\n\nThe city only now is completing a $7 million project to renovate the raceway that runs a mile's length down the river inside the city. That yearlong project — which lined the old ditch with reinforced concrete — was designed to re-line the raceway to mitigate leakage problems which had been wasting water drawn from the river for treatment at two plants.\n\n\"We were getting a lot of leakage through the old stone walls and the mortar joints. What we did was make a major improvement in terms of making new walls to contain all that water so we're not wasting any water as a result of taking it from the Brandywine,\" said Wilmington Commissioner of Public Works Jeff Starkey. \"We only want to take out as much as we can use. If we're leaking, we're over-utilizing the river which we don't want to do, particularly in the summertime when it really gets low.\"\n\nA few years ago, a portion of the river's stone retaining wall collapsed because of the crumbling infrastructure of an abandon raceway. Repairing it was a joint project between the city and state parks systems which cost Wilmington about $45,000.\n\nThe recent raceway reconstruction gave Public Works the opportunity to make improvements to the Brandywine Membrane Filtration Plant. Public Works installed new walls and feed lines at a cost of around $700,000.\n\nA pumping station farther upriver has covered the uptake from the river while the raceway and treatment plant were closed for repair. The raceway currently is active, but water isn't being drawn from it for residents' taps.\n\nSignage along the riverbanks through the city remind residents the bacterial content of Brandywine makes its water unsafe for swimming, let alone drinking. That makes essential water quality testing — directly from the river, at the treatment plants and from people's homes.\n\nBill and Kathy Bailey just moved from Bear to a new home minutes outside Wilmington city limits, and already they've made walks along the river a twice-daily ritual. But they've seen the signs and they know the river's purpose and said they only hope the aesthetics of the creek are matched by efforts to make it drinkable.\n\n\"Personally, I wouldn't want a repeat of Flint, Michigan, and I think they need to do everything they can do and have to do as far as water treatment,\" Bill Bailey said. \"The Cuyahoga River outside of Cleveland got set on fire. I certainly don't want that here.\"\n\nRaw water testing is done daily once the water enters the filter plant, Starkey said. Staff goes out into the watershed for testing once a month at seven sites along the river, four on the Brandywine and three were the Brandywine and Christina River merge.\n\nSTORY: Wilmington Public Works: Our water gets a clean bill of health\n\nVIDEO: Wilmington expects new water regulations following flint, Michigan\n\n\"Our biggest concern is upriver what's happening. We don't control what happens in Pennsylvania,\" Starkey said. \"Any development that is sending stuff into the river, we have to treat that water in order to drink it. Any development in Pennsylvania is out of our control, and farms, things of that nature, sending runoff into the river.\"\n\nThe non-profit Partnership for the Delaware Estuary pushes Wilmington to invest in the river's health and spends where it can with federal grant money, but Executive Director Jennifer Adkins said their efforts have to go beyond state lines because of the city's downstream location.\n\n\"It is challenging for a city like Wilmington, and they're certainly not alone,\" Adkins said.\n\nPhiladelphia has similar challenges with the Delaware River, and she said most cities divided by running water face costly economic and environmental challenges. Adkins' organization drives educational efforts in Wilmington, such as its annual Earth Day events aimed at teaching residents about the impact of their pollution on local waterways.\n\nThat outreach extends to politicians in multiple cities across three states, Adkins said, and that revolving door requires constant intervention.\n\n\"There are always new people coming into the mix,\" Adkins said. \"It definitely is a constant need, but you hope there always are more people who'll get on board.\"\n\nMost of Delaware's state-controlled parks include some body of water, whether it's a river, beach or pond. Superintendent for Wilmington State Parks Susan Staats said rivers like the Brandywine don't significantly trouble budgets.\n\nIt's even been 20 years since the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has had to take erosion control measures, which back then took the form of creek bank stabilization work. Other than that, she said they simply avoid mowing grass too close to the bank to maintain a vegetative buffer.\n\nTrees that come down and clog the river are her best example of an exception to that rule and clearing them generally is a cost shared between agencies, such as obstructions catching at the base of bridges, which fall under the auspices of the Delaware Department of Transportation.\n\n\"It's a natural-flowing river. I'm not going to sit here and say we do anything special as far as the management of the stream bank.

John Carney did not help distribute that water to residents as he did in Blades one afternoon less than two days after contamination was found there.\n\n“Access to safe and clean drinking water is an absolutely essential and basic human necessity, and we are extremely troubled by the situation in Blades,” U.S. Sens. Tom Carper, Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester wrote in a statement.\n\nSimilar sentiments have not been publicly shared with Millsboro-area residents.\n\n“I think there’s a clear inconsistency,” said Washington, D.C.-based environmental lawyer Chris Nidel, who is working with a Wilmington firm to pursue a case against Mountaire. “The system has favor for victims of certain types and it has favor for responsible parties of certain types. The worst of the worst, where you would expect the least response from state and local agencies, is when you have a favored perpetrator and an un-favored victim – that’s what you’ve got at Mountaire.”\n\nDr. Sacoby Wilson of the University of Maryland, who previously studied environmental justice issues on the outskirts of Millsboro, said that when there is an unincorporated neighborhood with no local political representation – as is the case for many of Mountaire's neighbors – that is what can lead to what he calls \"contamination without representation.\"\n\n\"Whereas a town that has political representation, where there are laws on the books for publicly regulated water, and they were highly responsive because of what happened in Flint, Michigan,\" Wilson said. \"People are hyper-sensitive to issues of clean water, safe water, across the country because of Flint. They don't want to be called the next Flint. But you already have a mini-Flint for the people that live near Millsboro.\"\n\nRELATED:Lawyers answer residents’ calls about Millsboro-area pollution\n\nNidel said cases of environmental justice – or injustice – can be seen across the country, particularly when pollution impacts a small number of people rather than an entire community.\n\n“If you had the same types of things going on in cities as you do in rural areas as far as dumping of waste, well, it just wouldn’t happen because you’d have people marching in the streets,” he said. “The true environmental justice is economic and political.”\n\nWilson said Mountaire's neighbors near Millsboro have economic and geographic vulnerability mainly because they are unincorporated, but race and economic status likely are playing key roles as well. The census tract that includes where bottled water was delivered has a median household income nearly $20,000 below the state average, and a poverty rate of 15.9 percent—higher than both the state and county average, data from censusreporter.org show.\n\n\"That community is going to get constantly ignored because of a lack of political representation, because of a lack of economic power, because of a lack of political power,\" he said. \"Those are factors that create conditions for environmental injustice.\"\n\nMillsboro-area neighbors have taken note of that as well. State and company officials have previously noted fewer than 100 people in the Millsboro area may be impacted by Mountaire's pollution, while Blades has an incorporated population of about 1,250 people.\n\n“One of the main things we’re up against is getting any support from any senator, state representative, anybody,” said Jay Meyer, who lives across the Indian River in a small community called Possum Point, who asked Wilson to study environmental justice issues in his neighborhood in 2014. “You elect these officials to work for the people in the community and the people who put them in office, but as far as anything to do with the environment, they just stick their head in the sand.”\n\nAs news broke in the fall about Mountaire’s inability to properly treat wastewater and dispose of sludge, and its lack of submitting legally required reports to state agencies, local elected officials like Sen. Gerald Hocker and Rep. Rich Collins – both Republicans that represent the Millsboro area – admitted the company had done wrong.\n\nBut both said at a recent public meeting that Mountaire is a substantial employer and the loss of the company would have drastic impacts to the local economy and agricultural community.\n\nHaving a \"favored perpetrator\" like the poultry industry does not help vulnerable residents, either, Wilson said.\n\n\"Big chicken has a lot of political power,\" he said. \"And if you have big chicken putting money in everybody's pockets, you're going to be less apt to respond. Like Jerry Maguire said, 'show me the money.'\"\n\nMountaire and local officials also have publicly cited the legacy levels of nitrates in groundwater – caused by decades of agricultural use in the area and upstream – as a more likely culprit of contamination.\n\nThe chemicals found in Blades’ public water supply are notably different from those found in private wells near Millsboro. In Blades, manmade perfluorinated compounds, or PFCs, were found at an average of twice the federal health advisory standard of 70 parts per trillion.\n\nRELATED:Sussex County town marks third site with known PFCs contamination\n\nNear Millsboro, state officials found monitoring wells with nitrate levels more than six times the safe limit of 10 parts per million. Nitrates, which can occur naturally in the environment, have long plagued southern Delaware waterways.\n\n“The truth is that they have different toxicological properties, but that only gets you so far,” said Nidel, who also holds a master’s degree in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “It’s still credible and important to say the extent of contamination near Millsboro is thousands of times higher than it is in Blades.”\n\nWhile PFCs are measured in tiny amounts – parts per trillion – nitrates are measured in parts per million. Accounting for that different measurement, the nitrate concentrations near Millsboro are exponentially higher than the PFCs concentrations in Blades.\n\nRegardless of the source and the differing toxicity levels of the two chemicals, both contaminated Sussex County sites could see adverse health impacts for the people drinking the tainted water over a long period of time – particularly for children and pregnant women.\n\n“There is truth to all that,” Nidel said of the difference between the chemicals and how they are measured. “But if you’re raising a kid and worried about their safety, I don’t know that that answer is all that comforting.”\n\nMountaire is not the only one\n\nThe spotlight has been on pollution concerns near Millsboro thanks to a slew of violations found at Mountaire Farms’ poultry processing plant on the outskirts of town, but contamination issues in that portion of Sussex County have been ongoing for decades.\n\nIn addition to the chicken plant, there also is the state’s only coal-fired power plant and accompanying coal ash disposal sites, a contaminated former pickle plant, two Superfund sites and a handful of other hazardous wastes sites – all within a five-mile radius.\n\nAdd historic agricultural land use on top of those other industries and it is no surprise the Indian River, a tributary of Indian River Bay, is cited as one of the most impaired waterways in the state.\n\n“It’s really a sad story because it’s one of the most important parts of the bay system,” said Chris Bason, executive director at the Delaware Center for the Inland Bays. “The Indian River is heavily polluted by excess nutrients and that’s primarily from farming practices and wastewater application to the land, like at Mountaire.”\n\nIn 1998, state officials recognized those problems and set a goal for reducing nutrient pollution. Nitrogen – nitrate is a form of nitrogen – going into the system needs to be reduced by 85 percent while phosphorous – a natural chemical found in high levels in poultry waste – needs to drop by 65 percent so that the river can be healthy once again.\n\n“Delaware needs to make clean water a priority for the health of its people, the health of its economy and the health of the river,” Bason said.\n\nMillsboro-area resident Bob Phillips said he remembers when the sandy bottom of the river was clear at Millsboro's Cuppola Park, and he grew up fishing and crabbing all throughout the Inland Bays.\n\n“I love the river and I always wanted a home on the river, but not anymore,” he said. Phillips lives on Jersey Road, less than a mile from Mountaire’s plant, and got an attorney shortly after he found his well had elevated nitrate levels.\n\n“The river is horrible,” he said. “It got to a point where you didn’t even want to pull your crabs pots up the water was so nasty. I sold my boat three years ago because of that.”\n\nREAD:WWII tower lights up the night at Delaware Seashore State Park\n\nDecades of pollution can lead to more problems than environmental degradation, which some say could harm the economy if problems such as algae blooms, fish kills and unbearable odors become bad enough to slow down southern Delaware’s thriving tourism industry.\n\nIn 2014, experts from the University of Maryland were invited to investigate pollution sources surrounding Millsboro and produce a rapid health impact assessment as part of a grassroots effort arguing against a now-dead proposal to convert an abandoned pickle plant into a poultry processing operation.\n\nThey concluded that people living within one census block near the Indian River “are overburdened with pollution from multiple sources.” The report also found those residents have a lower median household income and higher rates of certain diseases than those seen on the county, state and nationwide levels.\n\n\"The poverty rate for that block group was 19.9 percent compared to 8.9 percent for Sussex and 7.8 percent for Delaware,\" Wilson said. \"That means you have more people living below the federal poverty line, more people in economic distress with limited resources to move out of the area or respond to any negative exposures.\"\n\nWilson said because those residents also lived in unincorporated areas, there is a mixture of vulnerabilities than can lead to vastly different responses and outcomes for pollution problems.\n\n\"You get the Cadillac package or the Pinto package,\" he said. \"They're getting the Pinto response. And that's a lack of enforcement, a lack of compliance that would not happen in a community with more political power, more economic power, that had a different complexion.\"\n\nBreaking down the pollution\n\nBut since that report was released, not much has changed, said Maria Payan of the Socially Responsible Agricultural Project.\n\n“Nothing more has been done in terms of the health there,” she said. “I don’t know how to get these politicians and the county and everyone to address this issue. Basically, they’re just ignoring it.”\n\nPayan and other environmentalists took that frustration to heart and organized an environmental justice workshop to be held in Millsboro on Saturday. She said it’s vital that people learn how to become their own advocates and voice their concerns.\n\n“Your zip code should not determine whether you’re going to be overburdened with pollution because you don’t have the political power to fight back,” she said.\n\nPayan first became heavily involved in Millsboro-area issues when Meyer and his neighbors formed Protecting Our Indian River and went to court to fight against Allen Harim’s plans to bring a chicken processing plant to the former Vlasic pickle plant site off Iron Branch Road.\n\nThat facility has largely sat dormant since court battles and community outrage prompted Allen Harim to abandon its plans. Instead, the company recently announced it will use the plant as its new Delmarva headquarters and use space to debone some of its chicken products.\n\nBut a discharge permit that allowed the pickle plant to dump treated wastewater into Wharton’s Branch, a tributary of the Indian River, has been administratively extended since it expired in 2013. It has been about six years since Allen Harim purchased that facility, but the wastewater discharge permit still has not been updated to reflect a new owner or newly proposed use.\n\nIn 2013, a Brownfield investigation at the former pickle plant found there was contamination from trichloroethylene, or TCE, and tetrachloroethene, or PCE, various volatile organic compounds, chromium, chloride, chloroform, arsenic, lead and nitrate. A handful of samples exceeded safe drinking water standards, but as of 2017, officials said the contamination remained on site and would continue to be monitored.\n\nDown the street from that plant is another historic polluter – and notably one of the best success stories of pollution reductions in the area.\n\nThe Indian River Power Plant owned by NRG Energy has drastically reduced emissions over the years by fortifying its coal ash disposal site known as Burton Island and permanently taking three of four coal units offline.\n\n“Between 2008 with four units and 2014 with only one unit running, nitrogen oxides were reduced 95 percent, Sulphur dioxide was reduced 97 percent, particulate matter was reduced 98 percent and carbon dioxide was reduced 79 percent,” said NRG spokesman David Gaier. And eliminating once-through cooling, which is when the plant sucked water from the river to cool its units and then returned it as slightly warmer, also has shown environmental benefits.\n\n“I think we’ve gone the extra mile and we were happy to do it,” he said.\n\nThe plant’s Burton Island coal ash disposal site remains under ongoing maintenance, monitoring and reporting as sea levels continue to rise and threaten the spread of heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury.\n\nBason said the improvements at the power plant have made a huge difference, but concern remains about Burton Island.\n\n“Just like any toxic substances or toxic landfills, it needs to be monitored sufficiently,” he said.\n\nMillsboro has also seen its fair share of other potentially hazardous chemicals.\n\nIn 2005, residents in town were told not to drink the water after it was discovered that a TCE plume had traveled through the soil and groundwater from a former poultry vaccine manufacturing plant. Two of the town’s three wells became contaminated sometime between October 2004 and October 2005.\n\nSince then, a carbon-filtration system was installed to remove the TCE and the site is now on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priorities List as a Superfund site.\n\nThat TCE pollution resulted in a $2.75 million settlement between the state and the past owners of that plant, Mallinckrodt Veterinary Inc., and Intervet, and a final clean-up plan for the site was released in spring of 2016.\n\nREAD:Delaware vulnerable to election hacking, group says\n\nAnother Superfund site near Millsboro is the 140-acre National Cash Register Corp. site, where waste from plating operations and the manufacturing of cash registers contaminated groundwater with TCE. It took more than a decade to remove those pollutants and the EPA last reviewed the site in June 2015, finding that the cleanup efforts are “still protective of human health in the environment.” The site was also tested at that time for PFCs, but “no unacceptable risks were identified.”\n\nThe NCR site surrounds the former pickle plant site now owned by Allen Harim.\n\nBefore Mountaire bought the chicken plant on Del. 24 in 2000, the site was owned and operated by Townsend Inc. That company began poultry and grain processing operations in 1935. In 1988, a dump site on the property was found to have Benzo(a)pyrene soil contamination, but not at levels of risk to human health. A follow-up investigation in 2000 found most of the dump waste had been cleaned up and state officials required no additional action.\n\nMeanwhile, Mountaire’s current operations remain under investigation for improperly disposing of wastewater and waste sludge, which has led to groundwater contamination in the area.\n\nBut shortly before those violations were publicly noticed, the company was seeking to add a new production line and construct a 5,300-square-foot addition on site. Those plans have since been put on hold.\n\nThe face of persistent pollution\n\nWithin Millsboro’s approximate 1.5-square-mile boundary, residents are hooked into a central water system that draws drinking water from a deeper aquifer that is more protected from pollutants such as nitrates.\n\nPublic utilities, under the Safe Drinking Water Act, are required to monitor water supplies and report to the Office of Drinking Water to ensure they are providing customers with water that is safe for cooking, drinking and every other use.\n\nResidents on private wells – which is the norm for people living in unincorporated areas of Sussex County – have no state or federal oversight. Testing and monitoring is solely the homeowner’s responsibility.\n\n“People on private wells aren’t required to test, so we don’t see any of that unless they submit a test kit to the public health lab,” said Division of Public Health spokeswoman Andrea Wojcik.\n\nBut companies like Mountaire and public utilities are required to monitor their drinking water sources and often have monitoring wells onsite to ensure contaminants do not spread. A groundwater expert previously told The News Journal that there are 30 to 40 monitoring wells on Mountaire’s property.\n\n“Nothing was ever told to the families in all surrounding areas of Mountaire,” said resident Gina Burton, who grew up in the shadow of the Townsend, and now Mountaire, chicken plant. “When you’re not an environmental expert and you don’t know what’s going on, what’s being put in your body, your water system – when you don’t know, that’s when those things become silent killers.”\n\nBurton’s family members live on Herbert Lane, which is nestled between some of Mountaire’s largest spray application fields, where they discharge treated wastewater on to crops. She moved around a couple times, always in the Millsboro area. She returned to the lane at 18 and lived there until her 24-year-old son died of an asthma attack in 2015.\n\n“No matter what amount of money you put into the system, it doesn’t matter because you’ve already done a lot of damage,” she said. “It’s too late. It’s not right.”\n\nShe now lives about 1.5 miles away, still within sight of the plant. She said she struggles with her own health issues and worries about her pregnant daughter.\n\n“Mountaire and the Division of Public Health are holding our lives in their hands,” she said. “They’re making the call whether or not we suffer.”\n\nIn 2003, Mountaire was required to provide the people living on Herbert Lane with bottled water and a permanent supply of clean drinking water when elevated nitrates were found back then. Burton said they never got bottles or new wells – just a water softener system.\n\nNow it has been 15 years, and the story is almost repeating itself.\n\n\"This is an example of environmental racism then, and it's an example of environmental racism now,\" said Wilson, who will return to the Millsboro area in March for a public forum on pollution in private wells in inland Sussex County. \"It's environmental racism and it's also environmental classism.\"\n\nBurton is just one of the faces behind a community now plagued by pollution.\n\nBut because lawyers are now on the case, many of their clients are hesitant to share their stories with the press.\n\n“Historically, environmental justice communities have been talked over and kind of trampled on, but they know what’s going on,” said Stephanie Herron of the Sierra Club’s Delaware chapter. “They’re not stupid.”\n\nHerron said she understands the argument about the economic contribution of industries that are known polluters, but believes it does not have to be jobs or clean water. It can be both.\n\n“And a lot of the people burdened by the most pollution also work at those facilities and need those jobs,” she said. “I don’t have to pick feeding my family or poisoning my family. We all have to acknowledge that we need each other and we’re never going to achieve any of these larger, structural, social changes if we don’t work together.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/16"}]}

John Carney's 2025 budget", "text": "Delaware Gov. John Carney on Thursday presented a roughly $6 billion operating budget for 2025 that keeps taxes flat while continuing investments in public education, environment, agriculture, communities and government infrastructure.\n\nWhile Delaware’s benchmark budgeting strategy and utilizing one-time revenues for one-time expenditures helped avoid cuts and tax increases for fiscal year 2025, Carney warned that future budgets will be much tighter and require fiscal discipline to overcome.\n\nThe governor said negative revenues are estimated in 2024 and 2025, and Delaware’s rainy day and budget stabilization money will be needed to help bridge those gaps.\n\n“We’re able to use money from the (budget) stabilization fund to prevent the need to raise taxes and cut spending,” Carney said. “We’re still going to need the budget stabilization fund to address those declines in revenues without cutting dramatically and raising taxes.”\n\nThe budget proposal also maintains $410.1 million in the budget stabilization fund in preparation for revenues flatlining in the future. None of this revenue is used to balance the 2025 budget, but the state Office of Management and Budget Director Cerron Cade said if the revenue forecast doesn't change for fiscal year 2026, those funds will be needed next year.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHe estimated budget growth of 5% or more could spur the need to use some of those funds.\n\n“It’s probably something we’ll need to dip into in order to present a balanced budget if there aren’t any other changes in taxes or legislation,” Cade said.\n\nCarney postponed his scheduled State of the State speech last week due to illness, but has since rescheduled the presentation for March 5.\n\nRESCHEDULED:Gov. John Carney's annual State of the State speech postponed due to 'illness'\n\nThese are the key takeaways to Carney’s spending plan:\n\nAddressing soaring health care costs\n\nCarney said one of the big drivers in this year’s budget is health care costs, which have increased significantly both with the state’s portion of Medicaid and coverage for state employees and retirees.\n\nDelaware spends nearly $2 billion on health care annually, which is nearly 40% of the state’s total operating budget, Carney said.\n\n“We just have to get our arms around these expenditures,” he said. “Otherwise, these expenditures are going to crowd out other investments in teachers’ salaries, education, child care, all the different things that are important to us and important to Delaware families.”\n\nLAWSUIT:Judge temporarily blocks Delaware from changing state retirees' health care plan\n\nThe budget sets aside $200 million to address future deficits with state health benefits, which includes an estimated $93.9 million shortfall in fiscal year 2025, but it does not include funding to address the current deficit estimated to be about $41.1 million, according to a December 2023 fund report on Delaware’s Global Health Immersion Program.\n\n\"The rising cost of health care continues to be a major driver of budget growth and that to a certain degree dictates what we're able to do in other areas,\" said state Sen. Trey Paradee, D-Dover.\n\nIncreased funding for education and professionals\n\nCarney’s proposed budget dedicates $2.1 billion to K-12 public education, including funds to increase educators’ salaries, expand access to subsidized child care and early childhood education, and support other education initiatives.\n\nThe funding ensures Delaware continues to move toward a $60,000 starting salary for new teachers; provides a 1% salary bump to paraprofessionals on top of the 2% across-the-board increases for state workers; and dedicates an additional $10 million in opportunity funding to support low-income and English learner students, surpassing the 2025 goal of a total $60 million budget.\n\nRAISES FOR EDUCATORS:Delaware General Assembly passes fiscal year 2024 budget, with teachers seeing 9% raise\n\nThe spending plan also includes investments in higher education, including $30 million to state schools for deferred maintenance, capital improvements and technology upgrades and an $8 million increase in scholarship funding.\n\nThe budget includes funding for across-the-board cost of living increases for state workers, the average annual salary of which has increased 31% since 2017, state leaders highlighted in the budget report. Those salary bumps are key, Paradee said.\n\n“We still have a lot of vacancies in some really key areas and key agencies that we need to fill. We’ve done three pretty significant pay increases over the last three budgets, particularly the last two, and that really hasn’t moved the needle that much, particularly in the area of health care and a lot of front-line workers,\" he said. \"So, in order to maintain services, we’re going to have to continue to increase state employee pay so we can be more competitive and be able to retain employees.”\n\nContinued investment in environment, agriculture\n\nThe 2025 state budget dedicates $129.6 million for environmental and climate action initiatives, including:\n\n$7.5 million for electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy.\n\n$20 million for open space preservation.\n\n$24.7 million for shoreline and waterway resiliency.\n\n$32.8 million for clean water efforts.\n\nFinancial support also includes $3.5 million for lead assessment and remediation; $4 million for “cover crop investment to support climate smart initiatives and improve water quality;” and $3.2 million for “conservation cost share to expand water quality improvements and protect human health.”\n\nEV TRANSITION:Delaware implements electric vehicle mandate, phasing out the sale of gas-powered cars\n\nThere’s also $2 million set aside in the Agricultural Production Insurance Assistance Program to offer financial support for eligible producers.\n\nGovernment infrastructure investments\n\nThe proposed budget includes nearly $100 million for state police, courthouse and public safety infrastructure improvements and renovations, the biggest price tag coming in at $26 million for a new Delaware State Police Troop 4 building between Georgetown and Millsboro in Sussex County.\n\nAn additional $77.3 million is budgeted for improvements to other government buildings and facilities along with state parks, and includes $6 million for upgrades to the Carvel State Office Building.\n\nOther funds allocated include:\n\n$37.3 million for state agency minor capital improvements and deferred maintenance.\n\n$22 million to build the Emily P. Bissell/Forensic Science Facility.\n\n$12 million to improve parks statewide.\n\nEnsuring thriving communities, small businesses\n\nThe budget continues to invest in Delaware communities, allocating millions of dollars to libraries, affordable housing, downtown development districts and historical and recreational site preservation.\n\nIt also sets aside a total of $71.8 million for small business and infrastructure, the largest sum of $25.3 million to be used for research collaborations with state universities.\n\nInitiatives include:\n\n$12.5 million for supporting jobs in Delaware.\n\n$10 million to the Site Readiness Fund.\n\n$10 million for suburban roads and subdivision street paving.\n\n$5 million for a “graduation lab space.”\n\n$5 million to the Transportation Infrastructure Investment Fund.\n\n$4 million to the Riverfront Development Corporation.\n\nReview Carney's 2025 budget presentation\n\nGot a tip?

She was discouraged, too, by her salary, saying her teenage students were making just as much if not more money per hour working at McDonald's or Walmart.\n\n“I was like, 'What am I doing with my life?' I have a whole degree, a degree that cost thousands of dollars. And a 16-year-old is making more money than me at an hourly job,” Aubin said. “It was not worth the amount of work and the amount of physical and emotional toll it took on me, because I do care about them. I care about my kids so much. And it broke my heart.”\n\nAubin, who graduated from Plymouth State University in May 2021 after transferring from the University of New Hampshire, was paid an entry-level salary of $37,714 for the 2021-22 school year. She calculated she earned just over $16 per hour after taxes, based on the hours she worked. The McDonald's in Aubin’s area of the state has a starting pay of $16 per hour and Walmart starts workers at $20.\n\nAubin’s experience reflects current times in the education field in New Hampshire and nationally. Schools have been reporting an increase in resignations, and data shows fewer college graduates completing education degrees and getting certified to teach. Also, colleges report fewer students entering teaching programs.\n\nPortsmouth Naval Shipyard:Base to fill 1,200 jobs in 2 years. How to get hired, what it pays.\n\nLow pay is one reason.\n\n“I want to financially get out what I put in, and I work really hard,\" Aubin said. \"And I know my work ethic, I know my value. ... If I was getting paid 100 grand to do what I was doing, then it would be a no-brainer, I would have stayed and done it because you're doing 100 grand worth of work in your time there.”\n\nShe's now working as a copywriter.\n\nData shows fewer people are going into teaching\n\nThe past decade has seen a decline in the number of students finishing education degrees in New Hampshire. According to federal Title II Higher Education Act reports, during the 2011-2012 school year, 1,050 out of 2,874 education students completed their degrees. That dropped to 739 out of 2,397 in 2018-19 and 698 out of 2,767 in 2019-20, the first year of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThis data reflects national trends. Title II reports during the 2011-2012 school year, 203,997 out of 621,898 education students completed their degrees, dropping to 150,200 of 559,335 in 2018-19 and ticking up slightly to 152,939 of 601,467 in 2019-20.\n\nSimilarly, teacher certifications have decreased. Title II reports 1,221 teacher certifications in New Hampshire in 2010-11. A steady decline began after 2016-2017, going from 1,103 that year to 860 in 2018-2019 and 526 in 2019-2020, the first year of the pandemic.\n\nPortsmouth teachers get pay increases:Mayor says educators must 'feel valued.'\n\nAt UNH, the number of education majors completing the undergraduate program declined from 103 in 2010 to a decade low of 32 in 2022, according to data provided by the school. The number of students graduating with master’s degrees in education at UNH was 250 in 2011 and declined in recent years with 116 in 2022.\n\nKeene State College, which was founded in 1909 as a teacher's college, has seen education student enrollment drop from 727 in 2015 to 467 in 2021. Keene in 2021 placed two programs related to science teaching on administrative hold due to low enrollment.\n\nAndrew Coppens, associate professor of education and learning sciences at UNH, said low salaries in teaching jobs make it difficult to pay student loans. He noted UNH is one of the most expensive public universities in the country for in-state students.\n\n“If teaching doesn't provide that salary, people just aren't going to go into the profession,” Coppens said. “On that side, it has a lot to do with the amount of resources that the state provides our districts to pay teachers competitive salaries. Funding is very low in New Hampshire relative to other states.”\n\nCoppens said federal aid and loan forgiveness programs can help to offset the cost of higher education, but this does not fix the overall issue.\n\nImpact of 'divisive concepts' law in NH\n\nLow pay was not the only factor in Aubin's decision to leave teaching after one year.\n\nIn 2021, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed legislation known as the \"divisive concepts\" bill, though that phrase was not in the final version of the bill. The state law bans certain teachings around race and class in public schools. The American Civil Liberties Union and the state's two largest teachers unions sued the state over the law, claiming it has a \"chilling\" effect on teachers talking in the classroom about privilege, oppression and bias. The lawsuit is ongoing with oral arguments scheduled Sept. 14.\n\nJames Morse, superintendent of the Oyster River school district, and former member of Sununu’s Advisory Council on Diversity and Inclusion, called the law “contradictory and confusing,” leaving teachers unsure of what they can and cannot teach. The law states anybody, including parents, can make a claim that teachers are in violation of it. That can spark an investigation and could lead to a teacher losing their certification.\n\nLast school year:New Exeter principal apologizes — called parents who oppose critical race theory ‘whackos'\n\nAubin said because of this law, her school made the decision to disallow teachers from showcasing any flag besides the American flag in their classroom, such as Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ flags.\n\nWhen it came time for Aubin to start a unit in her freshman class on “To Kill a Mockingbird,” she felt she could not have an open class discussion about the topic of racism.\n\n“It made it really hard, and it made me legitimately scared,” Aubin said. “I didn't feel comfortable having those conversations because I didn't want to get in trouble … it was heartbreaking and infuriating at the same time.”\n\nCoppens said, “I'm concerned about the current and future realities for New Hampshire teachers and what some of the events, policies and laws in New Hampshire and economic realities might mean for us being able to continue to recruit teachers into the education profession.\"\n\nHow one Portsmouth teacher has dealt with the law\n\nCynthia Young, a social studies teacher at Portsmouth High School with about 20 years of experience, said her school has not put any restrictions in place on topics involving racism and sexism. “I taught them before. I still teach them now,” she said.\n\n“If you look at the actual wording of (the law), it doesn't actually prevent me from teaching anything. It is designed to instill fear in teachers so that they will be scared of teaching issues of race and sexism and anything systemic,” Young said. She tells her students, “My job is not to make you think like me, my job is to teach you how to think.”\n\nNH creates special education watchdog agency:Parents of kids with disabilities applaud.\n\nYoung said she uses lots of primary sources with varying opinions as one way of teaching in an unbiased way. She also teaches students how to research and find articles they can trust, to help form their own opinions. Young always asks students to share their research with the rest of the class to circulate different sources of information.\n\nShe noted she teaches a 1950s history class, which includes the civil rights movement. “You can't teach that without dealing with issues of racism,” Young said. She called the state law restricting some teachers \"very vague. It's purposely vague. But ultimately, there's nothing I cannot teach.”\n\nShe added, “Portsmouth is very supportive of the teachers and realizes how much the bill really is about trying to get people to self-police and not say things that might be controversial.\" However, Young has spoken to other teachers across a variety of schools who are afraid to have certain conversations and use certain books in their classrooms. “There are a lot of teachers who are chilled by it.”\n\nEducation students voice concerns about future careers\n\nBryson Badeau, a recent graduate of UNH with a bachelor of arts degree in secondary theater education, has noticed a decline among his peers continuing on education tracks.\n\n“I also graduated with another secondary theater education major who is not pursuing grad school and does not plan to be a teacher anymore,\" Badeau said. \"I’ve known three or four people who have dropped the education major altogether.”\n\nBadeau also voiced concern about his own future as a teacher.\n\n“I worry about facing discrimination in my classroom for being Black and trans, and I worry about my students potentially facing discrimination for being any sort of minority,\" he said. \"I worry about not being able to freely discuss what my students are interested in learning. I worry about all the mass shootings that have been happening in schools and one day my classroom falling into the list of (so many) others. I worry about not being able to teach curriculum that I’m passionate about in order to please the school board. But mostly, I worry about my students resenting education and learning.”\n\n'Is it real?\":$50K in donations for Portsmouth custodian who lost his wife inspired by teacher\n\nImpasse in Dover:Should raises go to new or mid-career teachers? Union, district disagree.\n\nAubin also expressed concern about safety because of the shootings seen in schools around the United States.\n\n“I'm like, 'How am I going to either barricade us, or how are we going to get out?' And I'd say that’s something that I thought about every single day,” Aubin said. “That took a toll on me, like to have that anxiety and that I have to keep 20 kids safe. It's just a lot. And it's a lot to carry.”\n\nAmanda Motzkin, a recent English education graduate from UNH, feels similar stress over her future career. “I have met people who are afraid to go into a system that sometimes seems to be hopeless and a struggle. I myself am scared to start teaching for fear of saying the wrong thing or teaching something I’m not supposed to, not realizing that such topics would be considered wrong.”\n\nLoss of teachers hits hardest in lower-paying districts\n\nPay for teachers is not equal in districts across New Hampshire, which relies heavily on local property taxes to pay for education. Schools in wealthier communities typically offer higher pay.\n\n\"That's a big problem,” Coppens said.\n\nLori Lane, superintendent of schools in Somersworth, feels the same way.\n\n“I wish that there was more equity and pay that was not related so heavily on a community's ability to raise tax dollars to support collective bargaining agreements,” Lane said. She said low pay is a main reason for teacher resignations in her district.\n\nOne teacher resigned in Somersworth to go to another district in the Seacoast area that pays $25,000 more. “I mean, you can't turn that down,” Lane said.\n\nNew NH education funding lawsuit:Focus in town-to-town inequality of property taxes\n\nLane said there have been 26 teacher resignations so far this year in Somersworth, the state's smallest city. Two of them were teachers leaving the field altogether. They are both in their late 20s and had been teaching four or five years, Lane said.\n\nFinding substitute teachers is also difficult, Lane said.\n\nAnother challenge, Lane said, is students in kindergarten through high school had lower stamina to focus on schoolwork after returning to in-person learning following the worst of the pandemic. In elementary school, many were exhausted by 11 a.m.\n\n“I think some of that also took its toll on our staff. ... It just felt, it felt harder this year,” Lane said.\n\nSolutions and consequences\n\nCoppens said it is important to think about what motivates teachers to go into the field. He emphasized money is not typically the main reason, but teachers can't continue to be poorly paid.\n\n“We need to raise teacher salaries. Not by enormous amounts, but just so that teachers aren’t strapped into needing to work two and three other jobs in order to pay their bills,” he said. “Instead, they can focus their energy on their areas of their professional competency, serving the children and youth that are in front of them.”\n\nDian Mawene, assistant professor of special education at UNH, suggested one way to strengthen the existing teacher workforce is to encourage more paraprofessionals who assist in classrooms and with special education students to become certified teachers. She pointed to accelerated programs offered through community colleges and universities.\n\n“I think that's really good because they have existing experience and knowledge by being in the school,” Mawene said.\n\nAccording to Kelly Dunn, chair of the Education Department at NHTI — Concord’s Community College, the school offers a conversion program for people who have degrees in other areas, but want to transition into teaching. Dunn said NHTI is the only institution in the state with a program specifically for paraprofessionals who want to become certified teachers. Dunn said although NHTI has seen roughly a 30% drop in undergraduate education majors, the education conversion program enrollment has not decreased.\n\nMany public schools in New Hampshire are seeing drops in enrollment due to the state's aging demographics while teachers are facing new pressures.\n\n“Right now, the quality of public schools in New Hampshire is, I consider to be under assault,” Coppens said. “A main driver of the quality of schools is the quality and preparation and situation of a public-school teacher.”\n\nSeacoast education news: Download the Seacoastonline mobile app and the Fosters.com mobile app to stay connected to local school news.\n\nCoppens said school systems play a crucial part in growing the state's population and encouraging young families to live here.\n\n“If we don't make New Hampshire a desirable place for young families with young children early in their careers, we threaten the economic viability of the state,\" Coppens said. \"And from a social justice perspective, we threaten to further marginalize rural and other disadvantaged communities in New Hampshire by not providing this high quality basic social service that's been a foundation of American democracy for ages, which is, public education.

And for that reason, it is, I think, a really important leg in the stool in our overall democracy.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/02/13/american-teachers-salary-raise-many-democrats-republicans-agree/11212931002/", "title": "Teacher salaries become a bipartisan cause: Low pay 'a major crisis ...", "text": "Having met and fallen in love through their careers as special education teachers, Natalia Sandoval and her husband tried to make it work as long as they could. But after a while, they could no longer get by on two teacher salaries while raising two sons in Hawaii, not to mention paying back the student loan debt they’d accumulated so they could train to work with students with disabilities.\n\nShortly before the pandemic, Sandoval’s husband Joseph traded in the career he loved for one that would keep their family afloat: as a worker on the docks. It helps pay the bills and may even allow them to buy a house one day, but it’s hardly as rewarding, said Sandoval, who knew from an early age growing up on Oahu that she wanted to be a teacher, specifically in special education.\n\n\"I stay because I really enjoy working with the kids. ... And I like supporting the families more than anything because it's a very difficult world to navigate,\" Sandoval said.\n\nBut veteran teachers like her and Joseph are often forced to decide whether the job is worth the sacrifices. \"We're just surviving, not thriving.\"\n\nOverworked, underpaid:The toll of burnout is contributing to teacher shortages nationwide\n\nTeacher pay is again in the news, with both Democratic President Joe Biden and Republican Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders vowing to raise educators’ salaries in their addresses to the nation last Tuesday night. Lawmakers in a number of states, both blue and red, have introduced or passed legislation boosting educators’ salaries over the past year or so.\n\nA bill before the U.S. House would incentivize states to raise teacher pay, setting a minimum salary of $60,000. And Sen. Bernie Sanders, the new chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee, will soon introduce similar legislation.\n\nRaising teacher pay has become an issue of rare bipartisan consensus, suggested Sanders, who shared initial details of his plan exclusively with USA TODAY ahead of a teacher town hall he hosted with the country's largest teachers unions Monday evening. Against that backdrop, Sanders says the issue will be one of his top priorities.\n\n“We’re in the midst of a major crisis in education, and if we are going to have the best educational system in the world – which we should have, which we must have – we’re going to have to very much change our attitude toward teachers,” Sanders said.\n\nSchools are becoming hotbeds of political conflict:And that's especially true in purple districts\n\nHow much do teachers make?\n\nNationally, the average starting salary for a teacher is less than $42,000, while teachers of all levels of experience make about $61,000.\n\nThose numbers mask significant variation from state to state, however. See this breakdown from the NEA to see what teacher salaries look like in your state.\n\nIn addition, there are lots of prerequisites to becoming a teacher, including a bachelor’s and often master’s degree, student-teaching experience and an exam-based license. Yet compared with similar college-educated workers, teachers make less than 77 cents on the dollar.\n\nThis \"teacher pay penalty\" has grown over the decades, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, hitting a new high in 2021. In 1996, teachers made close to 92 cents on the dollar.\n\nTeacher shortages:Some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBernie Sanders: $60,000 minimum needed to solve teacher shortages\n\n“If our goal is the best educational system in the world, if our goal is to be able to attract the best and the brightest young people into education, we're going to have to substantially raise our teacher salary,” Sanders said, pointing to shortages of teachers ravaging some parts of the country. “In my view, that must be at least $60,000 a year.”\n\nTeacher shortages:They hurt disadvantaged students the most\n\nSanders’s bill would triple federal funding through estate tax increases targeting the wealthiest Americans. It would pump roughly $450 billion total in new mandatory federal funding into every district, starting with $40 billion in the 2024 fiscal year. Districts would then have to use that money at least in part to raise teachers' base pay.\n\nA bill recently reintroduced in the House by Democrats would, through grants, incentivize states and districts to similarly increase teachers’ base salary to $60,000.\n\n\"President Biden said during the State of the Union address, 'Let's give public school teachers a raise.' Republicans and Democrats gave a rousing applause because it is long overdue,\" said Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, a co-sponsor of the bill, in a statement.\n\nExperts stress better compensation is just part of the solution. \"We absolutely need to (raise teacher salaries), but that alone is not enough,\" said Tequilla Brownie of The New Teacher Project. \"We have to also address the other pieces that go with it, like working conditions, the culture, the way we support teachers.\"\n\nWorking extra hours, jobs to pay off student loans\n\nSandoval has received some pay bumps, including a temporary $10,000-a-year bonus for Hawaii special education teachers designed to alleviate shortages in that and other hard-to-staff areas. She also has after-school gigs as a tutor, and in the past, has worked in administrative roles.\n\nNearly 1 in 5 teachers have a job outside the school system, according to recent federal survey data. That’s on top of spending 52 hours weekly in their teaching position (fewer than half of which they spent actually teaching).\n\nIf it weren’t for that supplemental income, teachers like Sandoval say it’d be difficult to pay their bills and pay off student debt. Nearly half of educators took out student loans to pay for college, according to data from the National Education Association and owe $58,700 on average.\n\nVery few educators have had their loans forgiven through a federal program for people who work in public service.\n\nStudent loan forgiveness:With Biden plan in legal limbo, Feds seek changes to rules for another debt relief option\n\nStates that have raised teacher pay\n\nThe prospects of federal legislation boosting teacher pay are questionable at best. Many Republicans resist the idea of setting such policies at the federal level.\n\nBut at the state level, both Democratic and Republican governors have enacted legislation increasing teacher pay. Some examples:\n\nNew Mexico : Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, in spring 2022 signed into law a bill that increases base salaries by 20% on average. It faced no opposition in the Legislature.\n\n: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, in spring 2022 signed into law a bill that increases base salaries by 20% on average.

Tate Reeves signed into law increases averaging $5,100, raising salaries by more than 10%. Governors in states ranging from Delaware to Tennessee have proposed teacher raises this legislative session.\n\nSarah Sanders' education plan\n\nAmong the most prominent Republicans rallying around teacher pay: Sanders, who unveiled her education plan shortly after delivering the Republican Party’s response to Biden’s 2023 State of the Union.\n\nThe so-called Arkansas LEARNS Plan would increase teachers’ base salary from $36,000 to $50,000. It would also “reward good teachers” with bonuses of up to $10,000 each.\n\nThe Arkansas Education Association, the state’s teachers union, said it appreciated the emphasis on educator compensation but warned against other aspects of Sanders’ proposal.\n\nIn Utah, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox just signed a bill that would allow parents to use public dollars on private school tuition, and it raised teacher salaries. Sanders' plan is similar, allowing public funds to be spent on private schooling and limiting instruction about race and gender identity.\n\nContact Alia Wong at (202) 507-2256 or awong@usatoday.com.

Kay Ivey’s statewide order to wear face coverings in public places to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin entered the order following a hearing. Real estate agent Debbie Mathis and retired sheriff’s Deputies Larry Lewis and Barry Munza, all of Jackson County, filed the lawsuit against Ivey, State Health Officer Scott Harris and the State Board of Health. The lawsuit contends that the mask order was illegally adopted and that the plaintiffs face deprivation of liberty anytime they interact with others. On July 15, Ivey announced a requirement for face coverings to be worn by anyone older than age 6 who’s in public and within 6 feet of someone who’s not a relative. The rule makes exceptions for people who have certain medical conditions, are exercising or are performing certain types of jobs.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A crew member on a state ferry tested positive for the coronavirus, which caused a cancellation of the service in Southeast Alaska. The Alaska Marine Highway System said the planned run of the ferry M/V LeConte in Lynn Canal near Juneau was canceled Sunday after the diagnosis was obtained. The highway system, which is part of the state Department of Transportation, said the crew member recently returned home after a two-week rotation on the LeConte. It was not immediately clear when the crew member was tested. Ferries spokesman Sam Dapcevich said state transportation officials were notified Saturday that a ferry worker had the coronavirus. No close contacts with the infected crew member were identified in Juneau or on the ferry, and no specific testing or quarantine recommendations were made for crew or passengers, the marine highway service said.\n\nArizona\n\nYuma: A massive testing blitz is underway in Yuma County, with elected leaders and health officials aiming to administer up to 10,000 free COVID-19 tests by the end of the week. The county remains a hot spot for the new coronavirus in Arizona, with infection rates double the state average, even as the number of reported daily cases has decreased significantly. Yuma County teamed up with Yuma city officials and the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to set up the testing blitz, which started Tuesday. The blitz goes until Saturday and will take place at the parking lot of the Yuma Civic Center, one of the larger venues in the region that is able to accommodate the massive drive-in project. “Our numbers are going in the right direction. Now is the time to move forward even harder so we can get a strong foothold, as opposed to starting to let up because the numbers are starting to go our way,” Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday reported 383 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 11 more deaths from COVID-19, the illness it causes. The Department of Health said at least 50,411 people have tested positive for the virus. Of those, 6,847 cases are now active, meaning they do not include those who have died or recovered. The Arkansas COVID-19 death toll has risen to 566, but the number of people hospitalized with the illness has decreased by one to 507. Arkansas Education Secretary Johnny Key also announced that the state will begin releasing numbers of total and active cases within a school district’s population. Key said the numbers will help districts as they prepare to reopen schools later this month. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has stood by plans to reopen schools for in-person instruction, despite opposition from teachers’ and pediatricians’ groups.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The state’s second-largest school district has announced stricter reopening guidelines than California at large, and officials say that “it will be a matter of months – not weeks, not days” – before students can return to campus. San Diego Unified School District made the decision Monday after health experts from the University of California, San Diego wrote in a report this week that the district should adopt stricter measures than those being enforced by the state, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. “We’ve seen the mistakes that have been made in other places … because they made an arbitrary decision that wasn’t really based on science,” School Board President John Lee Evans said in a virtual news conference. San Diego Unified now says schools won’t reopen until there are fewer than seven community outbreaks over a weeklong period. Currently, there are 24.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has extended an executive order requiring property owners in the state to give tenants a 30-day notice before pursuing evictions as individuals struggle to make payments during the pandemic. Previously, property owners would only give 10 days’ notice. Polis announced the extension Monday, hours before it was set to expire, The Denver Post reports. It is now set to expire in a month. Many residents “continue to experience substantial loss of income as a result of business closures and layoffs, hindering their ability to keep up with their rent payments through no fault of their own,” Polis said. Several studies have shown hundreds of thousands of Colorado residents could be at risk of eviction as unemployment remains near-record levels. Associations representing property owners have insisted evictions won’t happen on a major scale because there are strong incentives to keep tenants housed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s acting public health commissioner was asked Tuesday to consider significantly expanding visitation rules at nursing homes and chronic disease hospitals. In a letter sent to Dr. Deirdre Gifford, a coalition of 12 advocacy groups said guidance from the Department of Public Health issued June 22 that allowed only outdoor visits “unduly excludes people with disabilities” and those with mobility issues. Also, they said the order has been implemented “restrictively,” allowing only 20-minute maximum visits. “Life in a nursing home is isolating. When residents are further isolated by losing contact with those they love and depend on for their social and emotional needs, the results can be fatal,” the organizations warned. The advocates agreed that nursing homes could impose “a reasonable COVID-19 testing requirement on visitors” wanting to see loved ones.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state will not regularly announce positive COVID-19 cases in schools and will instead do so on a case-by-case basis, public health officials said Tuesday. It will also not require teachers and staff to undergo testing before the school year begins. “There may be times when there’s really no need for the public to know,” said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the state Division of Public Health. “For example, if a person was positive, but no one else would have been considered exposed, that’s unlikely to be made public.” The state announced last week its intent to test all teachers and staff before the start of the school year. But the state can’t force school staff to get tested. That will be up to districts, said A.J. Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. “It’s highly encouraged, we’ll put it that way,” Schall said. “The districts are the ones that employ the teachers.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Amid widespread protests and unrest over the police killings of Black Americans, a national commemoration of the 1963 civil rights March on Washington is being reconfigured to comply with coronavirus protocols in D.C. Although many marchers will arrive via charter buses from surrounding communities Aug. 28, the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the organizers, will ask some to join satellite marches planned in states that are considered hot spots for COVID-19. “We’re following protocol,” Sharpton told the Associated Press. All participants will be required to wear masks, Sharpton said. Organizers also will provide hand sanitizing stations and conduct temperature checks throughout the event. The revised plan appears to avoid a potentially awkward face-off with Mayor Muriel Bowser’s government over COVID-19 restrictions in the nation’s capital.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing for college football to be played as scheduled this fall, saying Tuesday that canceling the season as some conferences are doing because of the coronavirus will put the players at more risk outside the protective bubble provided by their teams. DeSantis made his remarks shortly after the state announced 277 more deaths, a one-day record that is likely misleading. Because of reporting lags, the state health department figures do not necessarily represent deaths in a 24-hour period. Tuesday numbers often include deaths not reported over the weekend. Dr. Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, said Tuesday’s total is not a reflection of what happened the previous day. “You have deaths that may be going back more than a month that are just getting reported now,” she said, but the number does reflect the deadliness of the disease during its surge in the state in late June and July.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an argument that requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax. A lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter alleged the postage requirement is an unjustifiable burden on the right to vote. While voters can still cast ballots in person early or on Election Day, the lawsuit argued that the option of in-person voting “does not really exist because of the pandemic” and is also nearly impossible for some elderly or disabled voters. Some voters don’t have stamps on hand and can’t get to the post office or don’t want to go there and risk exposure to coronavirus, the lawsuit said. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during a pandemic, but said its availability means the requirement is not tantamount to a poll tax.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: While Pacific Islanders make up just 4% of the state’s population, they represent 27% of the state’s newly confirmed coronavirus cases, according to state Department of Health data. White people have 20% of the newly confirmed cases and make up a quarter of the state’s population. The next highest rates are people of Filipino heritage, at 18%, and Native Hawaiians, with 14% of the state’s cases. No other ethnic group had double-digit figures, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said the “Pacific Islander community has some unique challenges, particularly while living in very large, committed, multigenerational families – a lot of them in Kalihi.” State Health Director Bruce Anderson said the disproportionate number of cases in the Pacific Islander community is rooted in socioeconomics, and state officials must help combat those inequities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state could finish the fiscal year with $405 million in surplus tax revenue in spite of the pandemic’s economic toll, according to a new revenue forecast. The state’s legislative budget office late Monday released its revised general fund revenue forecast for fiscal year 2021, which started July 1. Revenue comes in at $4.1 billion, according to the new forecast – only $6.5 million below what lawmakers used in March when setting the budget and just before Republican Gov. Brad Little issued a stay-at-home order due to surging coronavirus infections. The surplus is being boosted by a nearly $100 million cut to state agencies and another nearly $100 million cut to public schools enacted earlier this year amid possible budget shortfall concerns due to the pandemic. The cuts came amid a steep economic downturn when thousands of Idaho workers lost their jobs.\n\nIllinois\n\nWaukegan: Social distancing is becoming a problem at local beaches as large crowds flock there during the pandemic, officials said. Visitation guidelines have been changed at some Lake County beaches to accommodate visitors, some of whom are from Chicago, where beaches remain closed. Bob Feffer, who has been a site manager at Illinois Beach State Park for 32 years, said he has not seen crowds like the ones during the weekends in July. The state park had about 15,000 visitors July 25-26, the Lake County News-Sun reports. “There were just too many people for social distancing to take place,” Feffer said. The beach is no longer open on the weekends. David Motley, Waukegan’s director of marketing and public relations, said that “there was a lot of pent-up demand for people looking to get out and do something in the area. ... We already knew we could accommodate a large number.”\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: A school district that sent 228 students home to quarantine to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 has shuttered its middle and high schools for 14 days and switched to remote learning. Delaware Community Schools announced Tuesday night that it was closing Delta High School and Middle School for the period. “Our secondary schools seem to keep ramping up with exposure/symptom related issues that increase the number of quarantined students being excluded from school,” Superintendent Reece Mann said in a message to the school community. Parents of elementary students “appear to be doing an incredible job of self-screening their children and keeping them home when they are exhibiting symptoms,” Mann said. Only seven students from the district’s three elementary schools had been sent home as of Tuesday morning, compared to 68 middle school and 153 high school students.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 600,000 masks, 109,085 face shields, 22,527 gallon-sized bottles of bleach, 63,074 bottles of hand sanitizer, 233,303 pairs of gloves and 12,398 thermometers. That’s what Iowa school districts have told the state they need to help protect students, teachers and staff from the coronavirus during the first 30 days of the school year – even after they’ve spent federal money and large sums from their own budgets to acquire supplies. They made the requests after Gov. Kim Reynolds pledged to provide up to a 30-day supply of personal protective equipment as part of Iowa’s Return to Learn plan. The Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management will begin distributing “as many of the requested supplies as possible” beginning next week, Department of Education Director Ann Lebo said during a news conference with Reynolds last Thursday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Public health officials in three counties say a new state law is hurting their efforts to trace the contacts of people infected with COVID-19 by making it easier for them to refuse to cooperate. Public health departments often rely on employers to find out who has been in close contact with those infected, but the coronavirus law that was approved in June says “third parties,” such as employers and event hosts, must get consent from those who tested positive and close contacts to share their information to public health agencies. “Our disease investigators hold confidentiality to the utmost importance,” said Adrienne Byrne, director of the Sedgwick County Health Department in Wichita. “So I’m not sure what all went behind that bill, but it has not been good for public health because being able to do contact tracing helps us identify people that might turn positive.” Officials in Wyandotte and Johnson counties have also raised concerns about the law.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky’s secretary of state has offered a preliminary election plan that calls for expanded early voting but excludes no-excuse absentee voting by mail for all voters amid the coronavirus. His proposal would allow Kentuckians to cast mail-in ballots if they decide their age or health condition makes it too risky to vote in-person, Secretary of State Michael Adams said. That option also would apply to people living with them or caring for them, he said. “But I don’t think that we can do universal absentee (voting) because I think the system will crash,” Adams said. Adams’ proposals on how to conduct the general election amid the global pandemic were submitted this week to Gov. Andy Beshear, who has said he supports no-excuse absentee voting for November. The state’s June primary, which included widespread absentee voting by mail, resulted in the highest turnout for a Bluegrass State primary since 2008 and won praise.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s education department has set up an email for parents, teachers and others to report violations of coronavirus safety standards for schools, Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley told the state’s top school board Tuesday. The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in mid-July adopted statewide rules for schools holding in-person instruction amid the virus outbreak, such as a mask mandate for school staff and students in grades three through 12; distancing standards; temperature checks to enter school premises; and school bus capacity limits. Brumley told the education board that anyone worried a school isn’t following the rules can email ldoecovid19support@la.gov. The person will receive a survey to fill out, and the information is sent to the school system’s leaders to respond. “We have received a few concerns already,” Brumley said. Complaints reported to the department are posted online.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Dozens of cities, towns and tribal governments around the state will receive $4 million in grants to improve their response to the coronavirus pandemic, the administration of Gov. Janet Mills said Tuesday. The grants are designed to help fund projects that support public education campaigns, physical distancing projects and local businesses. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said the money has supported “innovative responses on the front lines of this pandemic.” One of the proposed projects is a campaign featuring a “Masked Moose” character in the town of Bethel. The campaign would include a costumed character who will visit schools and businesses to demonstrate the importance of coronavirus prevention. The round of grants is the second of its kind. The state announced nearly $9 million in grants to almost 100 municipalities in June.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A municipal government in China has donated 40,000 medical-grade face masks to Maryland’s capital city amid the coronavirus pandemic. The donations from Changsha, China, were first offered to Annapolis officials in April, when the need for the masks among public safety workers was high in the beginning days of the pandemic, Annapolis City Manager David Jarrell said in a news release Tuesday. They arrived this month, with one of the boxes featuring stickers of American and Chinese flags with a message that read: “Go, City of Annapolis! Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,” The Capital Gazette reports. Annapolis’ relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State officials on Tuesday urged residents in nearly three dozen communities with concerning rates of COVID-19 infection to step up their efforts to slow the spread of the disease. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said 33 communities across the state are seeing more than four COVID-19 cases per 100,000. The four hardest-hit communities are Chelsea, Everett, Lynn and Revere, said Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders. Baker said his administration is reaching out to local leaders in moderate- and high-risk communities to offer state support in combating the virus. State officials are encouraging residents in those communities to be sure to wear masks, keep their distance from others and avoid large gatherings. “We’re asking everyone to recognize that this virus continue to infect, injure and kill people every single day,” Baker said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The pandemic has temporarily shut down the Red Children’s Art Museum in the city’s North End, so founder Yvette Rock is bringing art to Detroiters through a mobile art gallery. Most recently, Rock has been coaxing people out of their pandemic shells to enjoy children’s art through socially distanced exhibitions that are part of Live Coal Arts Mobile, a mobile gallery in an 18-foot trailer. Most recently, the gallery has featured art made of popsicle sticks and other recycled objects, as well as an exhibition where a young Detroiter can have their drawing built out of Lego blocks. Rock, 44 of Detroit, won’t let the pandemic or any other challenges distract her from her mission: to transform lives through art, education and community. Before there was the Live Coal Arts Mobile and RED, there was the Live Coal Gallery, created by Rock in 2012 in Detroit’s Woodbridge neighborhood with a goal of being inclusive.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMankato: The Legislature was called into session Wednesday, but lawmakers don’t expect much to happen. Some legislators expected this month’s special session to last a day or less. Gov. Tim Walz called the session to extend Minnesota’s peacetime emergency order by another 30 days. The Legislature likely won’t address any financial bills this week as the state plans to sell $1.2 billion in bonds this month. The bond sale requires the state to have a steady financial outlook for a set period of time, state officials say. “The logic is, it would be like taking out a big car loan three days before you take out a mortgage,” said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato. “The people you’re taking out your mortgage from wouldn’t look kindly on a big loan.” As a result, DFLers and Republicans likely won’t consider a supplemental budget bill, a tax bill or a public works bill until late September at the earliest.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves described college football – even amid the coronavirus pandemic – as “essential” Tuesday, his comments echoing a tweet President Donald Trump posted the day before. “What do opponents of football think, these kids will end up in a bubble without it? You can get COVID anywhere,” Reeves tweeted Tuesday afternoon. “There are forces who want to cancel everything to avoid risk at all societal costs. It’s foolish. We have to balance risk & costs.” He said many players have been practicing for months over the summer and have built careers on football. Some have college scholarships riding on athletics. There is a way to let teams play while managing crowds, he said. “There is risk in all of life. There are things we can do to manage it without destroying society,” he said. “Limit crowds and let ’em play!” Conferences are not canceling football because of safety, he asserted, but out of fear of lawsuits and “bad press.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Drury University announced Tuesday that neck gaiters will no longer be considered acceptable face coverings on its campus. The university said in a tweet that it made the decision in consultation with the Springfield-Greene County Health Department. The announcement comes after a study released by Duke University analyzed more than a dozen different facial coverings ranging from hospital-grade N95 respirators to bandannas. Of the 14 masks and other coverings tested, the study found that popular alternatives such as neck gaiters, made of thin material, may be worse than not wearing a mask at all. The Washington Post brought the Duke study to attention through an article it posted Tuesday. The study used cameras and lasers to see the number of water droplets that come through each mask and found that a breathable neck gaiter ranked worse than the no-mask control group.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is allocating $50 million to increase the availability of child care in response to COVID-19, Gov. Steve Bullock said Tuesday. The funding was allocated from the state’s $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. The majority of the funding, $30 million, will be distributed in grants to providers who care for school-age children out of school time, officials said. An additional $10 million will be distributed to families with health needs and special needs requiring in-home care. Another $8 million will be divided among all licensed and registered child care facilities in the state to maintain and expand child care slots, cover increased staff costs, cover recruitment, address health and safety, and meet sanitation needs. The health department’s Child Care Resource and Referral Agency will receive $2 million for administration and outreach.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council on Tuesday approved an emergency mask mandate in indoor public places to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. The measure passed 7-0 after four hours of testimony from a divided public. The proposal had received support from many of the city’s biggest companies, including Union Pacific, TD Ameritrade, Mutual of Omaha and First National Bank. The proposed ordinance would require masks in places such as schools, businesses and churches. Eating and drinking in restaurants and bars, exercising in gyms, and visiting government offices would be excluded. Douglas County, which includes Omaha, has confirmed 11,449 coronavirus cases and 138 deaths since the pandemic began, according to the county’s tracking portal. The number of new daily cases has trended down over the past week. The number of cases in Lincoln has trended downward since the city began requiring masks July 20.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Dozens of teachers and parents gathered outside a high school Tuesday to argue against the Washoe County School District’s decision to reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The demonstration was held outside Spanish Springs High School in Sparks, north of Reno, where the district met in person a few days before students are expected to return Monday. The demonstration came after the district released a new reopening plan to help families prepare. But many teachers and parents have raised concerns about the safety of the plan and how to implement it. “Too many of the answers that we’re getting from the district are we don’t know yet, we don’t know yet, and that’s not acceptable,” said Robert Munson, a Washoe County teacher. The district meeting started at 4 p.m. and ended after 1 a.m. Wednesday. Most of the speakers were teachers who said they were frustrated with the decision.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu issued an executive order Tuesday requiring masks to be worn at scheduled gatherings of more than 100 people. Sununu, a Republican, has resisted calls to mandate the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and the new requirement falls far short of the mandates in the other five New England states, which generally require masks to be worn in public when social distancing isn’t possible. The order will be put to the test Aug. 22-30 at the annual Laconia Motorcycle Week, which typically attracts thousands of people to the state. It’s a smaller version of the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a 10-day event that began Friday in South Dakota. The mandate won’t apply to large workplaces or to schools, unless students gather for an assembly or other large event, Sununu said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that schools that cannot meet health and safety guidelines for an in-person start to the academic year can go with an all-remote option. The first-term Democratic governor said he will also soon sign an executive order that paves the way for the state’s roughly 600 schools to begin in-person instruction in September. The ability for some schools to start entirely remotely is a change from the governor’s June guidance, which required all schools to have in-person instruction. Then, in July, Murphy approved an option for parents to request all-remote learning for their children. Murphy said the change stemmed from “our willingness to listen” to stakeholders. The disruption stems from the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to three months of remote learning in the previous academic year. The health and safety guidelines include maintaining social distance and mask-wearing for staff and students.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The school year is getting underway at some of the state’s largest public school districts as teachers, students and parents deal with remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic. Albuquerque Public Schools started Wednesday. Schools in the district have been distributing technology to students, making virtual home visits, and providing guidance to staff, students and families. The Las Cruces district has outlined protocols for instruction, technology and nutrition services for that district’s all-online start. “We have prepared, and we are ready,” Las Cruces Superintendent Karen Trujillo said in a statement. She said educators participated in more than 350 professional development webinars to prepare for the start of virtual classes, and laptops and tablets were ordered at the beginning of the summer with the aim of every student having access to a device. Some students are still waiting, though, due to shipping delays.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Evictions are still on hold in the state’s courts as housing advocates worry about the fate of an estimated 14,000 renters who faced eviction before the declaration of a COVID-19 emergency. Courts spokeswoman Lucian Chalfen said Friday that the state’s stay of evictions is still in effect through a March 16 order signed by the state’s chief administrative judge. The announcement comes as housing advocates including the Legal Aid Society hope New York courts will heed Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s call for “no evictions” amid the pandemic. Last week Cuomo said a new state law makes clear that no evictions are allowed while New York is in a pandemic. “I signed the law, and the law is clear,” Cuomo said. “Until when? Until I say COVID is over. And you know, we’ll figure out when that is.” Still, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society said the law alone doesn’t offer enough certainty to tenants.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper won another legal victory defending his COVID-19 executive orders Tuesday, this time when a judge rejected Lt. Gov. Dan Forest’s demand that they be blocked by declaring his lawsuit is unlikely to succeed. The Republican lieutenant governor sued Cooper last month, alleging the Democrat’s orders limiting business activities and mass gatherings and mandating face coverings were unlawful because he failed to first get support from the Council of State. The 10-member council includes both of them, Attorney General Josh Stein and other statewide elected officials. Cooper’s state attorneys argued in a virtual hearing last week that the governor acted properly under portions of the Emergency Management Act that don’t require the concurrence of the council. They said the law lets him act unilaterally when he determines local governments are unable to respond effectively in the emergency.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: North Dakota Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said Wednesday that a new partnership with Minot State University will help ease the state’s shortage of special education teachers. Minot State will receive a $750,000 grant to pay for scholarships for 20 paraprofessionals who work with special education students, Baesler said. The grant money will help the paraprofessionals earn bachelor of science degrees with a major in special education. The $750,000 comes from federal coronavirus relief aid approved by Congress in March, which included emergency assistance to schools. Minot State special education department chairwoman Holly Pedersen said the university is excited to have an opportunity to partner with the state and find solutions to address the special education teacher shortage that’s happening nationwide.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Nearly 600,000 Ohio schoolchildren in 325 districts will return to school this fall for in-person classes, according to figures released by Gov. Mike DeWine. Almost 400,000 students in 55 districts will be attending online, while about 380,000 students in 154 districts will be doing some combination of in-person and online classes, the governor said. The state didn’t have information for 78 additional districts. DeWine said he believes schools are doing a good job of getting ready for all options. But children’s well-being as they return to classes, as well as their ability to do activities ranging from sports to band to theater, will be influenced by community efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the governor emphasized in Tuesday remarks. That includes continued mask-wearing, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Tulsa State Fair has been canceled this year amid concerns about the coronavirus, joining the previous cancellation of the Oklahoma State Fair in Oklahoma City. The Tulsa County Public Facilities Authority voted 5-0 to cancel the fair scheduled for Oct. 1-11 but said the Junior Livestock Show will continue. “I know for us it is a huge hit in the loss of money, but for me the greater concern has to be the health of our community and those who come here and then go home,” Tulsa County Commissioner and TCPFA Chair Karen Keith said during Tuesday’s meeting. Oklahoma State Fair officials announced in June the cancellation the Oklahoma City event scheduled for late September. The Oklahoma State Health Department on Wednesday reported 45,398 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 627 deaths due to COVID-19, an increase of 670 cases and nine more deaths than reported Tuesday.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s tallest waterfall, one of its most popular attractions, has reopened to the public with new guidelines in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Multnomah Falls opened in the Columbia River Gorge on Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service announced. New social distancing and face mask mandates were also announced, in addition to other strategies to keep crowds down and visitors separated from one another, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. There will be two phases to the reopening, the forest service said. The first, effective now, is first-come, first served and allows up to 300 visitors at a time between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to check in and wait in a socially distanced queue to the viewing platform at the bottom of the waterfall. The second phase, expected to be implemented in the next few weeks, will involve an online ticketing system allowing 300 people to visit the waterfall each hour.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Mayors are challenging the state’s members of Congress to help them get direct budget aid from the federal government, warning that cities of all sizes face steep deficits and deep service cuts as a result of the coronavirus’ impact on the economy. With Washington in a stalemate over a new round of funding, mayors warned of severe consequences on services and the economy without an injection of federal aid to cover slackening tax collections. They also pointed out that they received little in trickle-down from a prior round of aid to cover coronavirus costs that went to states and the most heavily populated counties. Pennsylvania’s 20-member congressional delegation is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with nearly every Republican balking at another round of federal aid.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state will delay the reopening of public schools by two weeks, to Sept. 14, to give educators more time to prepare to welcome returning students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Gina Raimondo announced her decision to give schools extra time Wednesday, saying that while she is eager for schools to resume in-person classes, it must be done responsibly. “It gives schools a little more time to be ready,” said Raimondo, a Democrat. “So you can have confidence that when we reopen school we’ll be in good shape. We owe it to the children.” Under Raimondo’s plan, local schools will be allowed to resume full-time in-person instruction only if they meet certain safety benchmarks. A final decision is expected the week of Aug. 31. Raimondo said local districts must put in place detailed plans dealing with details such as student transportation, in-school traffic flow, class size and mask use.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Most school districts in the state will not open their doors to students all five days a week when they start the new academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the governor demanded all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option. The state Education Department approved the last of the reopening plans for all 81 districts in the state Monday. Just 1 out of every 5 school districts will open its doors to students five days a week, and four plans start without any in-person option for classes, although those districts promised to bring in students whose parents want them to be in a school building as soon as it is safe. On July 15, Gov. Henry McMaster said he wanted to see all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option, saying that “we must have our schools available” and that “parents must have a choice.” Many school boards resisted.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A local company that is developing a COVID-19 therapeutic announced Tuesday that it has embarked on human trials. SAB Biotherapeutics said 28 healthy volunteers were participating in the company’s phase-one trial of its antibody treatment known as SAB-185. The phase-one study will evaluate the safety of treating patients with the therapeutic, which is a human antibody that can be produced at large scale using genetically modified cattle. The 28 healthy volunteers will be given single and multiple ascending doses of SAB-185 to demonstrate its safety. A second part of the phase-one study to evaluate the safety and pharmacological activity in SAB-185 in COVID-19 patients is slated to begin later this month. Besides treating ill patients, SAB-185 is being developed for use by first responders and others as a protective treatment.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Legislation designed to provide sweeping liability protections against coronavirus lawsuits to schools, health care providers and businesses advanced Tuesday. The Republican-dominated Statehouse is convening for a special legislative session to address not only COVID-19 liability but also telemedicine coverage and penalties against protesters. Gov. Bill Lee announced last week that he was convening a special legislative session to address a handful of bills lawmakers failed to advance earlier this year before adjourning in mid-June. Back then, the main dividing line over the liability bill was whether to make its protections retroactive to early March, which the Senate supported and the House opposed. The telemedicine bill was spiked as a response to the failure to pass the liability bill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state surpassed 500,000 confirmed coronavirus cases Tuesday as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott suggested family and neighborhood gatherings are behind a sharp rise in the rate of positive tests, which has climbed to record levels just as schools are beginning to reopen across the state. He also continued to say more testing in Texas is likely after dropping off in recent weeks, a trend seen across the U.S. even as deaths mount. Texas has reported more than 1,400 new deaths over the past week, including 220 on Tuesday. Although health officials say there are encouraging signs in Texas – particularly hospitalization levels that have dropped more than 30% since July’s peak – infection rates have been on a steady increase. On Tuesday, the rolling average of positive cases over the past seven days jumped to 24%, by far the highest of the pandemic, according to figures from the state Department of Health Services.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: For the first time in more than 43 years, the St. George Marathon is off. The city announced in a statement Tuesday that this year’s marathon, scheduled to take place Oct.3, will be canceled “due to concerns related to the potential spread of COVID-19 and the challenge of providing adequate health and safety protections for race participants and volunteers.” One of the largest marathons in the country, the annual St. George Marathon traditionally sees about 7,000 runners take part. Meanwhile, organizers have officially canceled the 2020 St. George IRONMAN Triathlon, also citing concerns about the pandemic. One of St. George’s biggest draws, the annual event typically draws athletes from around the world, bringing an average of $7 million in economic impact to Southern Utah. Initially scheduled for May 2, the event had earlier been postponed until September.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: With the start of school less than a month away, state officials on Tuesday announced some revisions to the school restart guidance, and Republican Gov. Phil Scott reiterated how important he thinks reopening schools is. Scott said he worries about the children of parents who don’t have time to teach their kids and struggle to pay for child care and the negative effect not reopening schools would have on them and children of more vulnerable families. “I truly believe that if we don’t provide a way to get those kids back into school, we’ll see the ramifications for years to come,” said Scott, who acknowledged the anxiety of some parents and teachers. The state will likely see some cases and clusters connected to schools, even though it has the lowest number of coronavirus cases in the country, he said. But the state has worked hard to build up its testing and tracing capacity, Scott and State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso said.\n\nVirginia\n\nVirginia Beach: Renovations have been delayed at the municipal building where a mass shooting happened last year. The Virginian-Pilot reports city officials don’t have enough money to pay for it now because of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter last week, the mayor of Virginia Beach asked the Legislature to consider allocating $10 million toward the renovations. Employees who worked in the building where 12 people were killed have been working at home and in offices across the city. The city plans to turn Building 2 into the headquarters for the police department. Plans also call for renovating several other buildings to bring former Building 2 employees back to the municipal center so that the Departments of Public Works, Public Utilities and Planning can again offer citizens services in one place.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State residents applied for relief funds as the coronavirus pandemic diminished their incomes and savings. But for undocumented workers, that wasn’t an option. After months of pressure from immigration activists and organizations, Gov. Jay Inslee is launching a $40 million state fund for undocumented workers, the Northwest News Network reports. “We’re excited to have a good chunk of money allocated to our community,” said Alejandra Perez, an immigration activist from the Seattle area who’s been working with the governor’s staff, Initially, the fund was a grassroots effort among several organizations to raise $100,000, but it raised $5 million over the past several months. Washington has an estimated 240,000 residents without legal authorization, according to the Pew Research Center, and they pay an estimated $368 million in state and local taxes.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The number of reported deaths from the new coronavirus in the state has jumped 23% in the past week, with six more fatalities announced Wednesday, pushing the total to at least 153. The state of 1.8 million residents has seen a smaller amount of cases and deaths compared to other places since the pandemic began. Lately, though, the numbers have been alarming. Confirmed cases have tripled in the past seven weeks, surpassing the 8,000 mark total Wednesday, while the numbers of deaths have shot up 66%. Officials have blamed the recent surge in part on vacation trips to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a popular destination for West Virginians. Gov. Jim Justice has constantly urged residents to wear masks but has resisted reimposing additional restrictions.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank delivered a sobering message Wednesday about the state’s flagship campus as the fall semester looms, saying that “we’re in a real financial crisis” due to the coronavirus pandemic. How bad the crisis will be depends on several factors, Blank said in an online presentation at the Rotary Club of Madison. Those include whether students who are enrolled for the fall semester actually show up, how deep state budget cuts are and whether the Legislature gives the university the authority to borrow money. Blank projected the loss to UW-Madison to be about $150 million with a full student body this fall. The loss will be greater if fewer students return who have committed and if state budget cuts worsen, she said. For now, the university is on track to have its target of about 7,400 freshmen on campus, she said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Wyoming is no longer the only state without its own suicide prevention call center. The Central Wyoming Counseling Center launched the state’s first and only service Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming has one of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. Residents previously were able to call national hotlines, but those answering don’t have important knowledge about the state, counseling center CEO Kevin Hazucha said. Hazucha and Bernice Hazucha came to Wyoming from New York in 2018 and spent a year meeting with various officials on starting a suicide call line. Wyoming eventually issued a request for proposals, and the Central Wyoming Counseling Center responded. Wyoming has allocated $400,000 for the hotline for two years. The suicide hotline will be staffed 40 hours a week, but organizers hope to expand that to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/04/08/disney-smiles-boardwalk-shots-parklet-program-news-around-states/115680484/", "title": "Disney smiles, boardwalk shots: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that the state is shifting to personal responsibility in the fight against COVID-19, keeping her promise to let a statewide face mask order expire Friday. Ivey said she’s issuing a “greatly slimmed down” health order that has few restrictions. It encourages people to keep taking precautions such as voluntarily wearing masks but no longer includes a statewide mask order. Alabama opened vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older two days ago, and state health officials said virus hospitalizations, percentage of positive tests and daily case numbers are hitting some of the lowest numbers in a year. But Alabama also ranks last in the country for the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We are finally rounding the corner. While we haven’t whipped this deadly disease just yet, it appears that, thank the good Lord, we are in the home stretch. Please, please continue to use good common sense, and we will see the end of COVID-19 soon,” Ivey said. The Republican governor said she’ll keep wearing a mask around others after Friday and urged other Alabamians to do the same. She also urged people to respect businesses who require customers to wear masks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Anchorage School District will implement weekly coronavirus tests for high school hockey players after at least 64 students either tested positive for the virus or were told to quarantine because they were in close contact with someone who had. The district said all the cases can be linked to two recent competitive hockey tournaments, Alaska’s News Source reports. “Unfortunately, we’ve gotten to the point where we have enough positive cases related to hockey that we are having to take extra precautions to keep schools open and keep kids safe while they are participating in ASD hockey,” said Kersten Johnson, the Anchorage School District’s senior director of secondary education. Johnson said the district will pay for the tests, and starting next week they will test for the virus until the end of the season. Players who have received the vaccine do not have to test, nor those who have tested positive in the past 90 days. The school district is also testing high school wrestlers every week as required by an executive order by the mayor. “For hockey, it is a little bit different. We’ve seen a rise in cases that are associated with hockey and felt the need to take that precaution,” Johnson said. The district’s high school hockey season was pushed back to the spring because of public health orders that deemed indoor gatherings inappropriate.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Pima County can continue to enforce its face-mask mandates to reduce the spread of the coronavirus in spite of an executive order issued by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey that bars local orders, according to an informal opinion issued by Arizona’s attorney general Tuesday. However, the opinion issued by Attorney General Mark Brnovich’s office said the governor could order the state health department to issue rules barring local mandates or ignore the opinion and try to enforce his executive order on his own. Three Republican lawmakers sought the opinion late last month after Pima County’s health department said it would continue to enforce its mask mandate despite Ducey’s new order barring local rules. Ducey cited lower COVID-19 cases and rising vaccination rates to end most business restrictions and revoke the ability of cities and counties to issue mask mandates. The opinion came on the same day Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said she would keep the city’s mask mandate in place. “I stand with the majority of the Phoenix City Council who agree that the governor’s unilateral decision to order cities to abandon mask requirements is a case of significant government overreach,” Gallego said in a statement. “The governor’s authority is not without limits.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Tuesday that he opposes government-mandated COVID-19 “vaccine passports” to access services, but he also said private businesses should have the right to require vaccinations. The governor echoed other Republicans’ opposition to state-required proof of vaccination. However, he said he favored giving employers latitude to require vaccinations, comparing them to drug tests. “I think you have to give latitude to the private sector,” Hutchinson said, saying some venues may want to make vaccinations a requirement to enter. “As a government, no, the state is not going to be requiring or mandating vaccinations.” A state bill filed last week would prohibit government-mandated vaccine passports. The Department of Health said Arkansas’ coronavirus cases rose by 163 to 331,261 total since the pandemic began last year. The state’s COVID-19 deaths grew by five to 5,653. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, dropped by five to 1,602. COVID-19 hospitalizations rose by seven to 152. More than 1.2 million of the nearly 1.9 million vaccine doses allocated to the state have been administered so far, the department said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOxnard: A gym owner is protesting a Ventura County panel’s vote to drop lawsuits against businesses that violated COVID-19 health orders while she could be forced to close over the high costs of obeying the rules. “It felt like a punch to the gut,” said Vanessa White, who with her husband, Kevin, co-owns Santa Paula Fitness. The Board of Supervisors unanimously decided in mid-March to dismiss suits against three gyms and two restaurants that allegedly refused to close their indoor operations as required by the state’s purple-tier limits. The establishments were the lone holdouts after county officials settled with the other 13 businesses the board sued over the issue, attorneys said. After voting in a closed session devoted to litigation, supervisors described the decision as an “act of goodwill” that came in concert with the state’s loosening of indoor restrictions under the more permissive red tier. Since then, they have acknowledged that the suits became moot after the state relaxed the rules. It’s not clear how many fines have been levied against the businesses, but penalties appear to be minimal. Only two citations amounting to $500 could be substantiated Friday. White said she applied for every form of aid she could for her business over the past year but owes $75,000 in back rent.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has reported its first two cases of a coronavirus variant first found in Brazil that has proven adept at infecting people who previously contracted the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified the state health department that two Boulder County residents tested positive for the variant, The Denver Post reports. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it is investigating whether they traveled to other countries or states where the variant is spreading and is also attempting to find other people who were potentially exposed. Officials did not identify the two people or say whether they lived in the same household. It was not immediately known if they had symptoms. The CDC has reported 289 cases of the same variant in 25 states across the U.S. Health officials in Colorado have collected a sample in all coronavirus cases for genetic sequencing tests to determine which variants are spreading and where. Officials have found 1,268 cases linked to “variants of concern,” versions of the virus believed to be more contagious, more severe, and more difficult for immune systems to identify and destroy. The state health department has urged residents to continue following safety guidelines, including wearing masks and social distancing.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials are looking into the possibility of eventually having to administer booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines in nursing homes, while also vaccinating new residents and staff who are coming into the facilities without having had a shot, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. About 5% of the nursing home population has been turning over each week in Connecticut. The newcomers are overwhelmingly not vaccinated, said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer. As a short-term fix, the state has asked the Connecticut National Guard to vaccinate those new admissions. “But in the meantime, we’ve also been working with our acute care hospitals to make sure that they’re vaccinating on discharge,” Geballe said, adding that nursing homes have been told they need to have a “vaccination partner” established with a pharmacy or other organization. Lamont told reporters his administration has been “thinking about” the possibility of having to administer booster shots to nursing home residents, a segment of the population that was hit especially hard by the pandemic. Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and a Connecticut resident, said it’s a “an open question” whether younger people will get a booster shot.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: From frying french fries to greeting guests, the state’s coastal businesses rely on a strong workforce to meet the tourists and residents who flock to their favorite restaurants, hotels and shops in the summer. But as more people get vaccinated against COVID-19 and make plans to hit the beaches, “help wanted” signs remain in many windows up and down the coast. Some business owners have called this year’s hiring season a “nightmare,” while others in the hospitality industry worry an employee shortage may worsen if the state further lifts pandemic-related restrictions and capacity limits. Especially after a winter that has been one of the busiest on the books for many businesses in Delaware’s resort towns, owners and managers are bracing for a busy summer season and hoping they have enough staff to ride the wave. While some beach businesses hire employees year-round, and others quadruple their staff during the summer, employers consistently say they’re feeling the pressure this year. Some are getting creative, calling local schools in hopes of finding students on summer break or flagging people down on the street as they walk by the restaurant. The Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce heard from enough businesses that it plans to host a job fair for the first time in years.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In another sign of a return to pre-pandemic normalcy, the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts has announced plans for its 50th anniversary season, including a September grand reopening, WUSA-TV reports. The Kennedy Center canceled its season last year but began welcoming some people back for performances in September 2020 as part of a D.C. pilot program. The mid-September reactivation of the Kennedy Center campus will include an opening curated and hosted by Michael Tilson Thomas and the unveiling of two immersive, interactive exhibits, plus a new life-size statue of John F. Kennedy on the grounds of the REACH, the Kennedy Center said in a release. The new season will include four artist residencies – including from The Roots and jazz artist Robert Glaspar – and numerous new works. “I can think of no better way to reemerge from the darkness of these last many months than to reopen with a vibrant, season-long celebration of the center’s rich history and the bright future of the arts in our nation,” Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: At Walt Disney World, the smiles won’t have to be hidden for much longer. Starting Thursday, visitors to the theme park resort will be able to remove their masks temporarily for outdoor photos, the company said on its website. The change tweaks a requirement that all workers and visitors age 2 and up wear masks except when they are actively eating or drinking, provided they are socially distanced and not moving about. The mask mandate includes those who already have been vaccinated. Workers and visitors have been required to wear masks, get temperature checks upon arriving and follow social distancing markers while in line ever since the Florida theme park resort reopened last summer after closing for more than two months because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: The Athens-Clarke parklet program was extended Tuesday, and the College Square outdoor dining plaza is now permanent. The parklet program was introduced at the start of the pandemic when the need arose for safe outdoor dining. Parklets were created by converting business-adjacent parking spaces or small sections of road into mini-parks with small dining areas. Tuesday’s commission vote extended the program, as well as the outdoor retail areas pilot program. The Washington Street outdoor retail program permits outdoor dining space and alcohol service for restaurants and retail stores in the area. The parklet program is tied to the COVID-19 local emergency ordinance currently in place, so the program will be extended for as long as that order is active. As a part of the extension, commissioners voted to have the Government Operations Committee develop plans for an ongoing parklet program that would continue past the emergency ordinance. Once that plan is developed, commissioners would vote on whether to make the parklets permanent sometime this summer, which would allow for a smooth transition from the temporary program.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The island of Kauai has rejoined the state’s Safe Travels program, which means out-of-state visitors can skip quarantining if they test negative for the coronavirus up to 72 hours before their flight. As of Monday, travelers to Kauai were allowed to bypass a 10-day quarantine by presenting pre-travel negative coronavirus tests, Hawaii News Now reports. The county had opted out of the program in December because of the global rise in virus infections. “We are now in a much better place today to have travelers coming in, and I think as more vaccines get out, generally speaking, the entire world will be in a better place,” Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami said. The island since December welcomed back some interisland travelers and adopted “resort bubbles.” The county’s resort bubble program, or Enhanced Movement Quarantine, allowed visitors to travel to Kauai if they got two negative coronavirus tests and spent three days either on another island or at a county-approved resort property. If they stayed at one of the resorts, they wore monitoring devices but could roam the resorts’ grounds and use amenities. Kawakami said rejoining the Safe Travels program will help buoy local businesses that struggled because of the public health restrictions.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little issued an executive order Wednesday banning state government from requiring or issuing COVID-19 “vaccine passports.” The Republican governor is also preventing state agencies from providing information on a person’s vaccine status to individuals, companies or government entities. Little, who has gotten the vaccine, said he strongly encourages others to get vaccinated as well. But he said he has serious concerns that a vaccine passport requirement will violate medical privacy rights. The White House has ruled out a national “vaccine passport,” saying it is leaving it to up the private sector if companies want to develop a system for people to show they’ve been vaccinated. All Idaho residents age 16 and older are now eligible to get a vaccine. About 70% of residents age 65 and over have already opted to get a shot. State officials say more than 325,000 Idahoans are fully vaccinated, and an additional 170,000 have received one dose of vaccines requiring two doses. More than 180,000 people in Idaho have been infected with COVID-19, and nearly 2,000 have died. About 1.8 million people live in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday urged Chicago union members to share their experience receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and act as “role models” for family and friends who may be reluctant even as the state prepares to open access to all adults. Harris visited a vaccination site in the city that opened last week for union workers. Chicago officials also hope the dedicated site will improve vaccination rates among Black and Latino city residents. After touring the site, Harris spoke to union members and said the site was “a model for the country” and told a group that their next task is encouraging others to receive a vaccine once eligible. “We’re all here to make a statement we understand the significance of getting vaccinated, that it’s bigger than us,” she said. “We are doing it because we know this is a room of role models, and people look to you to see how things should be done.” Illinois health authorities reported 2,931 confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday and 13 additional deaths. Since the start of the pandemic, Illinois has reported more than 1.2 million cases and 21,395 deaths. The state plans to open vaccine access to everyone 16 and older starting Monday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Bars and restaurants say they have not heard from public health officials after reports that an NCAA fan who visited a number of local restaurants died of complications from COVID-19 after leaving the city. Shapiro’s Delicatessen was one of the restaurants University of Alabama student Luke Ratliff visited while in Indianapolis to watch the Crimson Tide basketball team compete. On March 20, Ratliff tweeted a picture of a Shapiro’s pastrami on rye piled high on a plate and a bowl of mac and cheese, both sitting on a blue tray. Owner Brian Shapiro said an employee confirmed Ratliff’s visit, and it was his understanding the 23-year-old wore a mask, picked up a takeout order and left. But after seeing the picture from Ratliff’s Twitter account, Shapiro said it does appear Ratliff dined in. “The contact tracers should have been on top of this,” he said, adding that he blames Alabama “for not being proactive enough” more than local and state health officials. “The bigger question is why didn’t Alabama be more proactive with our board of health?” Shapiro said. Neither health officials nor contact tracers have reached out to his restaurant. Restaurants have a particular reason to be on edge after at least nine employees of the renowned St. Elmo Steak House contracted the coronavirus, and a longtime bartender died.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Coronavirus cases are on the rise again this week in city schools, resulting in 12 classrooms being temporarily closed due to exposure and more than 500 children in quarantine. Among those quarantined are 564 students and 22 staff, while 99 students and four staff tested positive for the virus, according to the school district’s data dashboard. Staff in the district of roughly 14,000 students have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The district follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for close-contact quarantine after exposure to the virus. Students and employees will be asked to quarantine if they spend 15 cumulative minutes within 6 feet of someone positive for the virus over a 24-hour period. If that happens in a classroom, students and staff may be asked to quarantine, resulting in a temporary classroom closure. Earlier this school year, the state of Iowa broke with the CDC’s guidance and said quarantine isn’t necessary if masks were worn at the time of the exposure. Iowa City schools sided with the CDC and still require quarantine regardless of mask usage. Iowa City’s rise in cases is mirrored across the state. At a news conference last week, Gov. Kim Reynolds acknowledged that cases have been rising but said she has “not seen evidence to suggest it’s leading down a concerning path.”\n\nKansas\n\nValley Center: The city’s school district is considering dropping its mask mandates and social distancing rules after a former Sedgwick County commissioner complained the policies are “irrational” because the number of COVID-19 cases is declining. The school board held a special meeting Monday in response to the complaint from former commissioner Richard Ranzau, who invoked a new state law that requires a school board hearing within three days of a complaint being filed and a final decision within a week of the hearing. On Tuesday, the Blue Valley School District in Overland Park canceled a similar hearing after a man who attended refused to wear a mask or leave. The Valley Center board decided to meet again Thursday to vote on the objection. The district had planned to keep the restrictions in place for the final weeks of the school year, The Wichita Eagle reports. Ranzau, whose son attends Valley Center High School, said the restrictions implemented in August are no longer valid because COVID-19 infection rates in Sedgwick County have dropped to between 3% and 4%, and school employees now all have access to vaccinations. The district, however, estimated only about half of its 550 total staff have been vaccinated.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear signed bills Wednesday directing more than $1billion in federal relief money for big-ticket items including broadband expansion, school construction and water projects. The infusion of federal money offers a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” for long-term investments to attract businesses, create thousands of jobs and improve quality of life, the Democratic governor said. It will also strengthen the state’s competitiveness in the post-pandemic economy, he said. A bipartisan group of lawmakers joined Beshear as he signed bills appropriating money flowing from the pandemic aid package championed by President Joe Biden and passed by congressional Democrats – including Kentucky’s lone Democratic congressman, John Yarmuth. State government in Kentucky is expected to eventually receive about $2.4 billion. Bills appropriating chunks of the aid passed shortly before Kentucky’s legislative session ended. “Everyone saw the potential,” Beshear said. “Everyone agreed that it was the right thing to do. And that now is the time to capitalize on this once-in-a-lifetime chance – a chance to invest in our people and a chance to rocket forward into our future.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: A teachers union has sued a northwest Louisiana school system, saying a $1,000 bonus discriminates against women, older workers and disabled people. The Caddo Parish School Board approved the “Caddo Heroes Stipend Allocation” for full-time employees who were present for at least 90% of their scheduled workdays during the 2020-21 school year. Red River United, a local of the American Federation of Teachers, filed its lawsuit Monday and announced it at a news conference the same day, news outlets report. “This year has been grueling, and every employee who has shown up for our students is a hero. That doesn’t change just because someone had to take time off to have a baby or went in for emergency surgery,” union President Jackie Lansdale said, according to KSLA-TV. Lansdale said Tuesday that with 3,000 members in Bossier, Caddo and Red River parishes, Red River United is the state’s largest local representing teachers and other school workers. Teacher aide Amanda Lowery told the news conference she can’t get the supplement because, as a paraprofessional, she does not get maternity leave and had to take extended sick leave, at 65% pay, after having a baby in February, The Times reports. “I was excited when I heard about the heroes pay, but then once they said I can’t get it, it’s like, well, what am I going to do now?” Lowrey said.\n\nMaine\n\nCalais: The state will work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get COVID-19 vaccines to residents in rural and underserved communities, officials with the state said Tuesday. The administration of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills said the state and FEMA will partner on a mobile vaccination unit, only the second of its kind in New England. The unit will start by bringing vaccines to Oxford on Monday, the governor’s office said. It will then go to 10 other communities in Maine, including Fryeburg, Calais and Madawaska, the office said. “The clinic will complement our existing vaccination efforts well and allow people in rural communities to more easily get the vaccine, protecting their health and that of their loved ones and helping us to win the fight against COVID-19,” Mills said in a statement. The governor’s office said the unit is expected to vaccinate at least 250 people per day. It will use the one-shot vaccine from Johnson & Johnson, the office said. Appointments will be required, Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said. Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, called the use of the unit “a major step forward” for Maine’s vaccination effort. Maine is one of the most rural states in the U.S.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan continues to back his administration’s purchase of 500,000 coronavirus tests from South Korea, even after a blistering legislative audit last week concluded that the procurement process was deeply flawed. At a news conference Monday, Hogan called the audit report “partisan nonsense” and said he “wouldn’t change a single thing.” “I’m still very happy with the tremendous success of acquiring these test kits,” he said. “It was probably one of the biggest accomplishments throughout this pandemic.” Hogan has lauded the purchase of the tests as an example of international cooperation in the early days of the pandemic, when testing and other resources were scarce. But the tests have since become a thorn in the Republican governor’s side, creating fodder for critics who say the purchase was little more than an expensive spectacle. The half-million virus tests had to be returned, largely unused, and replaced with new ones after a Maryland laboratory found they did not comply with federal regulations. The combined cost of both batches, plus a chartered flight for the first set of tests, came in at about $12 million, according to the legislative audit released Friday.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker received his COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday. The Republican governor got his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at the Hynes Convention Center in Boston. Baker, 64, has repeatedly said he would not move to the head of the vaccination line but would instead wait until he was eligible under federal guidelines. Massachusetts on Monday opened vaccine eligibility to residents 55 and older, as well as to all adults with one of several medical conditions that put them at greater risk from the disease. Baker said he preregistered and was notified last week that he could receive the vaccine. “So far I feel great,” the Republican told reporters. “This vaccine is a critical tool to end the pandemic. It’s also a critical tool to help people feel safe and to help them protect themselves, their families, their friends, their co-workers, their neighbors.” The Hynes site opened last month to replace a mass vaccination site at Fenway Park, which closed because it was needed for the 2021 Red Sox season. CIC Health, which is running the site, said last month that the two-shot Pfizer vaccine will be administered at the Hynes, subject to change depending on vaccine availability.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: The University of Michigan will stick to a virtual graduation ceremony but allow graduates to at least watch the event on screens inside the football stadium, officials said. The university has been criticized by some parents and students for not having a traditional graduation in the stadium even as COVID-19 vaccines become widely available and as restrictions on large gatherings are eased. The football stadium now can be opened at 20% capacity, a reason that was given Thursday for opening it to graduates May 1. The commencement speakers will be elsewhere but visible on screens at the Big House. Family members cannot be inside the stadium. “We’re grateful that changes in public health guidelines and conditions in our student community now allow us to offer the experience of being together in Michigan Stadium when their hard-earned degrees are conferred,” President Mark Schlissel said. It’s the second year that a traditional graduation has been canceled at U-M because of the coronavirus.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Tuesday reported nearly 500 residents are hospitalized due to the coronavirus as case numbers continue to rise despite the state’s vaccination campaign. The Minnesota Department of Health on Tuesday reported 3,014 new confirmed cases and four more deaths over the past three days. Reporting had been delayed due to a technical issue on Saturday and the Easter holiday Sunday. Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm expressed concern at the growing number of cases, citing a seven-day test positivity rate of 6% that continues to show signs of increasing after climbing above the caution threshold of 5% last week. “You’ve heard us mention a number of times, especially in the recent couple of weeks, that we’re definitely not out of the woods yet with this pandemic,” Malcolm said during a news conference. She said hospital bed use due to COVID-19 has increased 40% in the past 10 days, and 497 Minnesotans were hospitalized Tuesday, including 114 in intensive care. Malcolm said the state’s efforts to prioritize vaccinations in populations most vulnerable to the virus could prevent a spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths as seen during a surge late last year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is receiving about $29.7 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts. The award is part of $3 billion in coronavirus relief funding approved by Congress to bolster vaccinations, particularly among minority populations. “We are doing everything we can to expand access to vaccinations,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky said Tuesday. “Millions of Americans are getting vaccinated every day, but we need to ensure that we are reaching those in the communities hit hardest by this pandemic.” About 75% of the total funding must focus on specific initiatives intended to increase vaccine access and acceptance among racial and ethnic minority communities. At least 60% must go to support local health departments, community-based organizations and community health centers. Funds can be used to train trusted community members to conduct door-to-door outreach to raise awareness about COVID-19 vaccines and help individuals sign up for appointments, according to the CDC. Money can also be used to hire community health workers who perform culturally competent bilingual health outreach.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The health department on Tuesday announced it identified the state’s first case of a new coronavirus variant. Missouri’s Department of Health and Senior Services announced a Jackson County resident tested positive for a variant first identified in South Africa. The agency said a commercial lab identified the variant during genome sequencing. Health department Director Dr. Randall Williams in a statement urged people to continue taking preventative measures, such as wearing a mask and social distancing, as new variants spread to Missouri. “We also continue to ask that individuals consider getting vaccinated when they are able,” Williams said. “The vaccines that are currently available in the United States appear to be effective against these variant viruses.” Missouri found cases of another variant, this one first identified in the United Kingdom, back in February. The agency said there are at least 35 active cases of that faster-spreading variant in the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state has a new program to provide rental assistance for people who have lost income and are at risk of housing instability due to the pandemic, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Tuesday. The Legislature has appropriated $17 million in federal funding for the Montana Emergency Rental Assistance program. State officials estimate it will help about 8,000 renters stay in their homes. “The last year has brought real, serious challenges to hardworking Montana families through no fault of their own,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Emergency rental assistance will help Montanans, who have struggled financially through this pandemic, get back on their feet and remain secure in their homes.” Gross household income cannot exceed 80% of the area median income for renters to be eligible for the program. For example, income for a family of four in Missoula County cannot exceed $60,150, while income for a family of three in Yellowstone County cannot exceed $57,600. Renters can receive a monthly maximum of $2,200 for past-due and future rent payments, up to $300 for past-due and future utilities including gas and electric, and $50 per month for internet. Households can access assistance dating back to April 1, 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Residents who stop working temporarily to care for a family member with a serious health condition could claim unemployment benefits under a bill that state lawmakers advanced Tuesday. Legislators gave the measure first-round approval with a 27-11 vote. The proposal by Sen. Megan Hunt, of Omaha, would allow workers to collect benefits if they left a job due to family caregiving needs but are planning to return to work. Hunt said the bill will help caregivers who might otherwise struggle financially while caring for a loved one and will help the state avoid costly long-term care services in cases where no one else is available to take care of the person with a health condition. Some senators objected to the cost. The Nebraska Department of Labor estimates that, based on 2020 data, the state will pay out $749,927 in unemployment benefits each year. Hunt argued that 2020 is a bad year to use as a measurement because of the coronavirus pandemic, which left many people severely ill and caused unemployment to surge.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: State and federal health officials are taking mobile COVID-19 vaccination units this week to the Nye County community of Pahrump and a northern Nevada tribal site in Carson City. In Las Vegas, a drive-thru COVID-19 testing site was open Wednesday at Allegiant Stadium. The Southern Nevada Health District reported Tuesday that it had more vaccination slots available than people booking appointments at its biggest shot sites. The Cashman Center conference hall near downtown has not reached its capacity of 7,000 appointments a day, district official JoAnn Rupiper said. Sites also are open at the Las Vegas Convention Center and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas student union. Everyone 16 and older in Nevada became eligible to receive the vaccine Monday, and officials on Tuesday reported the percentage of the state population fully vaccinated topped 21%. Two Federal Emergency Management Agency mobile vaccination units are traveling the state for 30 days to offer shots to people in places where medical facilities are otherwise limited. Officials aim to provide at least 250 shots a day of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine to walk-up registrants ages 18 and older.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan says state residents have lost more than $950,000 to pandemic-related fraud, identity theft and other scams, and she’s pushing federal officials to do more to stop it. Hassan, a Democrat, wrote to the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday asking how it plans to use $30.4 million in pandemic relief funding to combat scammers she called “a danger to the health and financial security of Americans.” As of Monday, the commission had received more than 425,000 reports of such scams, Hassan said, including 1,461 from New Hampshire. The scams include offering quick access to stimulus payments and phony treatments to prevent or cure COVID-19. Meanwhile, more than 86,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in New Hampshire, including 402 cases announced Tuesday. No new deaths were announced, keeping the total at 1,249. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire has risen over the past two weeks from 295 new cases per day March 22 to 401 new cases per day Monday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: An assemblyman wants extra coronavirus testing and vaccination sites at the Jersey Shore, perhaps along the boardwalk for the summer season. Assemblyman Ronald S. Dancer – a Republican who represents a district that includes Allentown, Englishtown, Manalapan, Matawan, Roosevelt, Upper Freehold, Jackson and Plumsted – called for the state Department of Health to send more COVID-19 resources toward the coast in anticipation of warm-weather crowds. “The state could help protect the health and safety of tourism and hospitality professionals, year-round coastal residents, and tourists considering vacations at the shore, by setting up mobile coronavirus testing and vaccination units along the boardwalk or other prominent locations,” Dancer said in a news release Tuesday. “This would support an economic recovery down the shore while responsibly addressing coronavirus concerns.” Tourism contributes about $41 billion toward the state’s economy each year, according to the New Jersey Tourism Industry Association. Tourism-related taxes save each household $1,545 in property taxes annually, according to the association. In Asbury Park, social distancing measures resulted in a $700,000 drop from previous years in beach badge revenue, Mayor John Moor said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The New Mexico National Guard and Civil Air Patrol have logged more than 1.6 million miles over the past year as part of the state’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and officials say the work is not over as they try to get more people vaccinated. New Mexico on Monday made all residents 16 and older eligible for the vaccine. About 30% of the state’s eligible population already is fully vaccinated, and nearly half the population has received a first shot, according to the latest state data. Guard soldiers have been operating a vaccine distribution center in southeast Albuquerque, which U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich toured Tuesday. The effort will benefit from funding included in the federal government’s most recent pandemic relief package, specifically $20 billion that the New Mexico Democrat said will supercharge vaccine distributions nationwide. The recovery package also included $50 billion for testing, genomic sequencing of virus variants and contact tracing. New Mexico also will get nearly $7 million in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, on top of nearly $21 million previously awarded to the state Department of Health, as a result of the U.S. government waiving all cost-sharing requirements related to the federal disaster declaration issued last year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Lawmakers and Gov. Andrew Cuomo struck a budget deal that capped nursing home profits and established how much the long-term care facilities must spend on resident care and staffing. The nursing home industry reforms include a 5% cap on profits as well as requiring facilities to spend a minimum of 70% of revenue on direct resident care, according to budget documents released Tuesday. Nursing homes must also spend a minimum of 40% of revenue on resident-facing staffing, provided that the amount shall be included as part of the spending on resident care. The new provisions would take effect Jan. 1, 2022, the documents show. The reforms are part of the $212 billion budget on which state lawmakers were voting Tuesday night after missing the deadline to have a spending plan at the beginning of the fiscal year, which started April 1. “Every day, families across the state entrust the safety and health of their loved ones to nursing homes, and as this unprecedented public health crisis has shown, some performed admirably, but some did not,” Cuomo said in February, revealing some details of the reforms. Cuomo on Tuesday also signed a bill repealing COVID-19 legal liability protections granted to nursing homes and hospitals, under the Emergency Disaster Treatment Protection Act.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: Making shelter a right and boosting Buncombe County’s community paramedics, a program touted by police-defunding activists, are among priorities listed by City Council members for an expected $26million in federal pandemic aid. The money would come from the recently passed $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan whose details local governments are awaiting to understand how exactly they can spend the money. Council members talked about the massive aid injection – equal to about 13% of the city’s nearly $200 million budget – during a March 31-April 1 retreat. More recently, several council members responded to questions about their priorities for the money, noting those could change after they learn more about spending guidelines. Among priorities were focusing on rising homelessness, including making shelter a basic right; setting up a low-barrier shelter for people turned away from other places; and expanding on the county’s community paramedic program that seeks to address mental health, substance abuse and other issues without the need for law enforcement intervention. “I think it is pretty clear that cities have been experiencing an exponential increase in homeless,” Mayor Esther Manheimer said Friday, noting she has heard similar stories from other mayors.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state Supreme Court plans to resume in-person oral arguments in June. The Bismarck Tribune reports in-person arguments will be subject to parties agreeing to appear physically. If either party wants to appear remotely, the proceedings will be conducted entirely electronically. District courts will still have discretion to conduct proceedings remotely. Chief Justice Jon Jensen said some courts may decide to increase in-person appearances, but available facilities and local restrictions will dictate how proceedings are conducted. The Supreme Court also is considering making some pandemic protocols permanent, such as allowing defendants to plead guilty to Class C felonies in writing without appearing in court. The justices have met in person occasionally for case conferences, but they haven’t met for any hearings, according to State Court Administrator Sally Holewa. Justice Gerald VandeWalle, 87, was hospitalized due to COVID-19 twice last summer.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Several Republican lawmakers want to make sure those who don’t want a COVID-19 shot don’t face any penalties because of that decision. A state House bill introduced Wednesday would allow Ohioans to decline a COVID-19 shot – or any other vaccine – because of religious reasons, medical reasons or natural immunity. The proposal would prevent anyone who chooses not to be vaccinated from facing discrimination, being denied services or forced to require masks, or facing other penalties financial or social from businesses, schools or government. “This is a matter of freedom,” state Rep. Jennifer Gross, R-West Chester, said of her bill. “The purpose of this legislation is to allow people to choose to do what they feel is best for their own body and protect individuals from any consequences or hardships for choosing one way or the other.” Gross’ bill is backed by Ohio Advocates for Medical Freedom, an anti-vaccination group that advocates for the right to choose or refuse any medical treatment or procedure. The bill also is supported by 15 GOP lawmakers, several of whom told reporters they’d forgo the shot or wait to get one. Gross, a nurse practitioner who said she’s pro-vaccine, told the Dayton Daily News she would wait to get a COVID-19 vaccine, preferring “to watch it for a couple of years.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state will drop its residency requirement for COVID-19 vaccinations, the health department announced Wednesday. Beginning Thursday, the state will offer vaccines to people who reside in neighboring states and beyond. The Oklahoma State Department of Health said increasing supply and progress in the state’s vaccination efforts allowed for the change. Oklahoma is among the first states in the U.S. to openly offer its vaccines to nonresidents, according to the health department. Several Native American tribes also have been offering vaccinations to anyone old enough, regardless of affiliation or residence. So far, about 27% of adults in Oklahoma are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 44% have had at least one dose. Deputy Commissioner of Health Keith Reed said in a statement that the state was happy to welcome its neighbors in an effort to put an end to COVID-19 in the region. He hoped other states that have fared well in vaccine administration would follow suit. “This virus does not adhere to boundaries drawn on a map, so by ensuring high vaccination rates across the region – not just Oklahoma – we are providing an extra layer of protection for our residents,” Reed said. Recently, Oklahoma has seen more appointments go unfilled.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A measure that would reinstate and extend a moratorium on foreclosures until Sept. 1 amid the COVID-19 pandemic passed the state’s House of Representatives on Tuesday. Unlike the bill that was passed by lawmakers last June, the new legislation would not protect commercial property owners – those who own more than five properties or properties with more than four housing units. The moratorium would be retroactive to Dec. 3 and could be extended until the end of 2021 by the governor. The latest bill, which passed in the House 38-21, moves to the state Senate. “I assure you that Oregonians need this sort of protection. Without it, I fear that we face even more economic distress,” said Rep. Paul Holvey, D-Eugene. “More Oregonians will become homeless if this bill does not pass.” In March, more than 6% of Oregon homeowners – more than 65,000 – said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey. Financial hardships during the pandemic have only exacerbated the state’s ongoing housing crisis, making the issue a top priority for lawmakers, even prior to this legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Vaccination appointments in the city will be open to anyone 16 and older starting April 19, but health officials are still asking younger, healthy adults to wait to schedule appointments. The city’s health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, announced the moved-up date for opening vaccines to the general public Tuesday. Department officials had said in previous updates that they wanted to wait until May 1 because they were worried that younger, tech-savvy Philadelphians would schedule appointments quickly, making it more difficult for those at most risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19 to find appointments. Farley said President Joe Biden had asked Philadelphia and other cities around the country to move up their plans to open vaccines to anyone who wanted them to April 19. Philadelphia on Monday opened vaccine appointments to the last of its priority groups, which includes sanitation workers and postal workers. Farley said he has asked vaccine providers to keep making older people a priority, as well as those with health concerns. On Tuesday, he asked younger, healthier residents not to make a rush on the system when it opens appointments.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Opening regional vaccination sites is critical to helping make sure that everyone in the state who wants a COVID-19 shot has access, even if they can’t make it to a mass vaccination site, Gov. Daniel McKee said Wednesday. The Democrat, after touring new regional sites in Westerly and East Providence, said 97% of all Rhode Islanders have access to a vaccination site within a 15-minute drive. The East Providence site opened in collaboration with Barrington, Warren, Bristol, Pawtucket and Tiverton. The state currently has the capacity to administer 160,000 shots a week, something he expects will soon expand to 200,000 per week, accelerating the state’s economic reopening plan. “Every piece that we’re putting in place is critical,” he said. “Everywhere where we can get more and more people identified that they’re ready to get the shot, we’re going to be in a better spot when the supply starts meeting our demand.” The goal is to make it safe enough to have parades and fireworks on July Fourth and for the summer folk and jazz festivals in Newport. “We’ll get back to that kind of summer that we all want to enjoy,” he said. A little more than 25% of the state’s population has already been fully vaccinated, according to state Department of Health statistics released Wednesday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: The American Civil Liberties Union sued Gov. Henry McMaster this week, arguing that his executive order requiring state agencies to “immediately expedite” employees’ return to the office amid the coronavirus pandemic exceeds the governor’s authority. The complaint, filed Monday in state court, asked that a judge halt McMaster’s order, which the ACLU said “is contrary to the safety, security, and welfare of the state.” “Governor McMaster’s return-to-in-person-work order ignores public health guidelines and the continuing serious health risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and people with disabilities, women, and caregivers will bear the brunt of the impact,” ACLU of South Carolina legal director Susan Dunn said in a statement. McMaster issued the order last month, as vaccinations ramped up and cases declined, advising state agencies to “immediately expedite” the return of nonessential state employees to in-person work. According to the lawsuit, the order, which affects more than 24,000 state employees, was issued on a day when there were 776 new COVID-19 cases in South Carolina, with a seven-day moving average of 1,224 cases per day. The plaintiff, an employee at the College of Charleston, said she has been working remotely for a year and also caring for her son while he does virtual learning at home.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson received a shot of a COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday as part of an effort to promote widespread vaccinations in order to extinguish the pandemic. “This is how we get back to normal,” Johnson, a Republican, said shortly after receiving the shot at a Sanford Health facility. South Dakota opened vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older Monday, and it has recorded one of the nation’s highest rates of people fully vaccinated. But the congressman noted that as a man in his 40s, he represented a demographic that has been hesitant to get a vaccine. Although Johnson had an opportunity to get the vaccine when members of Congress received early access, he decided to wait until it was widely available. “Now is the time for people to step up, even if they’re young, even if they’re healthy,” he said. The state reported no new deaths Wednesday for a sixth day in a row, leaving the total pandemic death count in the state at 1,938. That’s the longest South Dakota has gone without recording a new death since this time last year. Nearly half of adult residents have gotten at least one dose of a vaccine.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday joined fellow Republicans nationwide in advocating against COVID-19 vaccine passports, which are being developed in some areas of the world to let inoculated people travel, shop and dine more freely. No city, county or government entity in Tennessee appears to have suggested forcing businesses to require patrons to show a vaccine passport. The legislation Lee is supporting, brought this week in the General Assembly, raises questions about existing vaccination requirements in public schools. The bill moving through the Legislature would not prevent a private business from instituting its own vaccine requirements, according to a copy of the proposed amendment. It passed the House health subcommittee Tuesday. “I think vaccine passports are a bad idea. I do not believe that government should impose vaccine requirements or mandates in any way,” Lee told reporters, while urging the GOP-controlled General Assembly to advance the legislation. Lee said he hoped private businesses also don’t impose vaccine passport mandates but said he doesn’t believe “that government should impose itself in the private affairs of business practices.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Fed up with difficulties related to COVID-19 vaccine access, multiple Vietnamese American organizations in the city say they’re taking it upon themselves to help vulnerable populations within their community. While Austin Public Health has distributed translated information regarding COVID-19 vaccines, those who work directly with the local Vietnamese community say the resources are not reaching people, namely those who are older in age, because of barriers related to language, culture and technology. “We have older people who do not speak English, who don’t know how to get on to the website; they don’t know how to register,” said Tony Pham, 67, a member of the Austin Vietnamese Senior Citizens Association. The channels through which seniors in the Vietnamese community get their information are disconnected from social media platforms like Twitter. Many in the older Vietnamese population also do not use email. To dispel some fears related to the vaccine, a local organization called Open Eyes Beyond Border worked with the senior association in late March to hold a vaccine information session, where medical professionals from the area answered questions in Vietnamese. The organization will work with a local pharmacy to hold a pop-up vaccination event this weekend in North Austin.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Intermountain Healthcare, which operates the major hospitals in southwestern Utah, announced Monday that it would be relaxing some of its visitor restrictions thanks to decreasing coronavirus case rates across the state. “As our understanding of the disease and transmission has evolved, we’ve decided to allow visitors for patients with COVID-19 for visitors at lowest risk of getting infected,” Kristin Dascomb, Intermountain Healthcare’s medical director for infection prevention for employee health, said in a press release. The new guidelines say for COVID-19 patients, visitors who have proven recovery from the disease in the past 90 days or have proof of completing a COVID-19 vaccination series at least 14 days prior to their visit will be allowed in most cases. In the case of a laboring mother, two visitors are allowed, with one visitor allowed to stay in the postpartum room. Children, infants and newborns in intensive care units are allowed two visitors in most cases. End-of-life patients can have up to eight visitors, with four visitors in the patient room at a time. All visitors must continue wearing face masks and must use hand sanitizer throughout their visits.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: As more residents get vaccinated, Gov. Phil Scott announced a three-month plan Tuesday for loosening COVID-19 restrictions, with a goal of being largely back to normal by July 4. “We’re in the last laps of this very long and difficult race, and this plan will show how we finish strong,” Scott, a Republican, said in his twice-weekly virus briefing. “But I want to be really clear: The key to getting there are vaccinations, which is why we’re laser-focused on making sure as many Vermonters as possible get them. And it’s why when you’re eligible, you need to sign up.” Vermont’s travel guidance will change Friday and be focused on testing rather than quarantining. Unvaccinated Vermonters returning to the state will be required to be tested for the coronavirus within three days, and visitors can come to Vermont without quarantining as long as they have a negative test within three days of arriving, Scott said. Vaccinated people can continue to travel without restrictions, he said. Mostly outdoor businesses, low- or no-contact professional services, retail operations, and farmers’ markets will move from sector-specific to universal guidance April 9. That will be followed by most other sectors May 1. Gatherings will be allowed to increase in size. Masking and physical distancing will still be required.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The Virginia Employment Commission says jobless workers collecting unemployment compensation will soon have to look for jobs again to receive benefits. The Virginian-Pilot reports the weekly job search, a requirement of state and federal law, was temporarily suspended during the pandemic. The commission said in a news release that the unemployed will be notified soon of its reinstatement. The requirement is to apply for two jobs each week. It also applies to people who get Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. People will be required to report information about their job searches to the state each week. Virginia Employment Commissioner Ellen Marie Hess said the requirement is coming back as demand for workers rises and as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state senator has apologized after she participated in a legislative video hearing while she drove a car to the Capitol. The Seattle Times reports that Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle, said her attempt to multitask Tuesday morning while driving to Olympia was “not in compliance with the law.” The Legislature passed a distracted-driving law in 2017, following testimony by families of people killed in vehicle crashes. Washington state code forbids several behaviors, among them “watching video on a personal electronic device.” Saldana, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, appeared on TVW’s livestream behind the wheel, with a virtual Capitol as background. She fielded a question about clean fuels. Saldana said she meant to disable the video and only use audio functions. She also wore lightweight ear buds; the law forbids earphones if they block outside sounds such as ambulances. The standard citation fine is $136 for a first offense. “I have supported legislation about penalties for distracted driving, and like all drivers in Washington state, I must be subject and accountable to that law and all traffic laws,” Saldana said in a statement. “Accordingly, if I receive a citation for this driving infraction, I will pay the fine.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state will receive $3.3 million for affordable housing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. West Virginia’s U.S. senators, Democrat Joe Manchin and Republican Shelley Moore Capito, announced the funding Tuesday. Most of the money, $3.1 million, will go to the housing trust fund, which gives grants to build and preserve affordable housing units for low-income earners. About $200,000 will go to the Charleston-Kanawha Housing Authority for programs to help public housing residents become self-sufficient and for homeless foster youth. “Many of our fellow West Virginians are currently experiencing homelessness, including children and families, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened this heartbreaking issue,” Manchin said in a statement. Capito said that “providing access to affordable housing for West Virginians who have fallen on tough times is an essential part of our public housing sectors.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Wisconsin State Fair wants public feedback on comfort levels toward large events, COVID-19 health safety measures and more ahead of this year’s fair. The fair linked a short survey – at bit.ly/39vLkDp – to posts on its social media channels that asks participants for information, such as whether they plan to attend, how they would view sponsoring companies and when they typically purchase tickets. Survey participants have a chance to win a $50 Visa gift card. The winner will be chosen and notified April 23. Last year, the Wisconsin State Fair was canceled for the first time in 75 years over the coronavirus pandemic. The 2021 fair is scheduled for Aug. 5-15.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state Department of Health has announced multiple coronavirus variants were discovered in Wyoming over the past several months. The Wyoming Public Health Laboratory recently analyzed genetic sequencing from multiple samples collected from residents since November and found at least 40 cases involved the variant first found in the United Kingdom, more than 40 cases combined involved two variants found in California, and one case involved the variant found in South Africa, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “Because this is far from a comprehensive review of all positive patient samples, the true number and geographical spread of variants of concern in Wyoming is likely greater than what has been identified,” state Epidemiologist Dr. Alexia Harrist said. Harrist said it is likely that all four of the variants have represented some of the virus transmission in Wyoming over the past several months, raising concerns because the variants have been shown to transmit more easily. “The best way for people to protect themselves from getting sick is to get a COVID-19 vaccine, which are available to the general public now throughout Wyoming,” Harrist said. “We still also recommend staying home when you are sick, avoiding large gatherings and wearing masks in most public settings.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/24/pandemic-panda-mania-uss-missouri-virtual-book-fair-news-around-states/113464262/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama has issued a prohibition on student gatherings, including off-campus parties and fraternity and sorority events, as the school tries to curb the spread of COVID-19. The university on Friday announced a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside of classroom instruction. Social gatherings are prohibited on and off campus and the common areas of dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses are closed, according to the new guidelines. Visitors are not being allowed in dormitories and sorority and fraternity houses. The announcement came less than a week after city and school officials raised alarm about large crowds waiting outside bars. The university said the hosts of gatherings will receive heightened consequences, even for a first offense, and that serious and repeated violations could result in suspension by the university. “While we are appreciative to those who have taken these expectations seriously, I am deeply disappointed that those guidelines are not being followed by each and every member of our student body,” University of Alabama President Stuart Bell wrote in a message to students.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: RavnAir Group, which halted operations in April, laid off staff and filed for bankruptcy because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, hopes to begin renewed service to its former hub communities in September under a new leadership team. Ravn Alaska CEO Rob McKinney said there is no set starting date as the airline tries to stage a comeback from a $9.5 million bankruptcy asset sale earlier this month, The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported. The airline plans to focus on safety and customer service as it gets back off the ground, McKinney said. The company operated more than 400 flights per day with a fleet of 72 aircraft, but passenger traffic dropped more than 90% after the pandemic outbreak. RavnAir Group is also owned the Corvus and PenAir carrier services, and flew passengers from Anchorage to the Aleutian Islands, the Kenai Peninsula and various rural Alaska destinations. Ravn Alaska will need about 400 employees and is actively recruiting staff. All employees, including former staff, will take courses before restarting, McKinney said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Possible exposure to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 means some students at Kyrene del Milenio Elementary School must quarantine, the school’s principal has told parents, azfamily.com reported Saturday. It wasn’t immediately known how many students were required to quarantine. But a letter sent by Principal Michael Lamp said the possible exposure happened in one teacher’s classroom and on one bus to school and another bus after school. The 14-day day quarantine will run from Wednesday when the last possible exposure occurred and the children involved can return to school Sept. 2, Lamp wrote. Kyrene has been using remote learning for most students since beginning the new school year on Aug. 17. But it has some students at school as required by a state mandate for districts to provide services to at-risk and certain other students.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:In her 28 years of teaching kindergarten at Fort Smith Public Schools, Cami Stancil had never made her students sit at desks. That will change Monday, when Arkansas Public Schools open with rules about students are supplied, where they are allowed in the school and how they are allowed to interact with each other amid the coronavirus pandemic. “While every year has been a little bit different, this one has by far been the greatest challenge,” Stancil said as she looked over rows of desks placed in taped-off grids in her Cook Elementary School classroom. The kinds of limitations schools should put on in-person teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has been debated throughout the U.S. State officials last week released a threat assessment map of the state, which lists school districts in one of five threat levels based on how many people per 10,000 are infected with the virus in the past 14 days within the geographic boundaries of a school district. With 30 to 49 infected people per 1,000, Fort Smith School District was listed in the second-highest of the five threat levels. Schools within the district have taken advantage of the virtual teaching option. At Cook, 115 of the roughly 550 students are going to use the virtual option to start the school year, Principal Marta Boltec said. For the students who will be taught in-person, district officials have mandated students to wear masks unless appropriately socially distanced. They also have assigned students numbers that correspond with their desks and other places they can go in the school.\n\nCalifornia\n\nUkiah: Schools in Mendocino County were forced to close this week when state officials said their coronavirus cases had been higher than previously reported, and several hundred students were sent home from class, officials said Friday. Michelle Hutchins, superintendent of schools in the county, said she learned this week the county had been placed on a state monitoring list for coronavirus infections with a date retroactive to July 25, and that as a result schools should have not been allowed to open for in-person instruction after that point in time. Hutchins said on Wednesday she sent home 300 to 400 students who had already started the year off in largely rural schools. It’s possible elementary school students will be allowed to return under special waivers offered by the state but middle and high schoolers will remain on distance learning until virus conditions meet the state-mandated thresholds for the Northern California county to fall off the state’s monitoring list, she said. The situation comes after California faced a problem in late July with electronic lab reports that were getting backlogged at the state. The state said it has since fixed the data issue but it led to a delay in reporting about 14,000 virus cases.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Windsor Middle School has quarantined 37 students and 11 staff members after learning a student tested positive for COVID-19. Thirty-seven seventh-grade students in the same A-group cohort as the student who tested positive were asked to quarantine and switched to remote learning through Sept. 10, said Lisa Relou, a communications specialist for the Weld RE-4 School District. Seven teachers who had direct contact with the student are also working remotely through Sept. 4, she said, as are four paraprofessionals who had contact with the student. The school was notified Thursday afternoon of the positive test result of a student who had been in class that day, Relou said. Students in Weld RE-4’s middle and high schools are attending classes in person two days a week and receiving remote instruction on the other three, Relou said. Group A attends classes in person on Mondays and Thursdays, she said, and Group B on Tuesdays and Fridays. All students receive remote instruction on Wednesdays while schools are cleaned and disinfected. Windsor Middle School has 686 students, Relou said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanbury: Residents are being urged to take precautions after what officials have described as a “serious outbreak” of the coronavirus. State health officials issued a COVID-19 alert Friday night that recommended that residents stay home, avoid unnecessary outings, limit indoor gatherings and avoid attending church services. It also urged people to cooperate with contact tracers and get tested immediately if they feel they have been exposed, and self-quarantine for 14 days if they test positive. “This is a serious outbreak in Danbury and we really need an all-hands-on-deck approach,” Acting DPH Commissioner Deidre S. Gifford said in a statement. The alert came days after a spike in cases led the city to cancel youth sports leagues. The state reported the city of roughly 85,000 has had nearly 180 confirmed cases from Aug. 2-20, compared to 40 new confirmed cases in the previous two-week period. Mayor Mark Boughton told the News-Times that 44 new cases were reported on Friday alone. Acting city health director Kara Prunty told the newspaper the seven-day average of new cases went from 2.3 in the week of July 19 to 8.4 last week. City officials have blamed the recent uptick on neighborhood gatherings such as barbecues, travel and youth sports.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware is joining the list of states taking up President Donald Trump’s offer of additional unemployment benefits to millions of American affected by the coronavirus pandemic. While announcing that Delaware will accept the offer, Labor Secretary Cerron Cade on Friday nevertheless criticized it as “a Hail Mary that is unnecessarily complicated and will be a nightmare to implement quickly.” “Furthermore, with the stability of the funding source and overall legality of the president’s memorandum in question, it is unclear if or when the additional benefits will be available,” Cade added. Trump acted by executive order to extend additional unemployment payments of up to $400 a week to cushion the economic fallout for people affected by the pandemic. The move came after negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House failed to reach agreement on extending a program that provided for supplemental payments of $600 a week, which expired Aug. 1. Trump’s plan calls for a weekly benefit of $300 a week, or $400 if states chip in $100 per claimant to provide the higher amount.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new giant panda cub is sparking pandemic-fueled panda-mania, and officials at the National Zoo said traffic on their livestream spiked 1,200% over the past week. “I’m pretty sure we broke the Internet last night,” National Zoo Director Steve Monfort said Saturday. The zoo’s Panda Cam traffic has been crashing since venerable matriarch Mei Xiang’s pregnancy was announced this past week. When she gave birth Friday night, zoo officials said they had a hard time getting into their own livestream, and they’re now working to boost their capabilities. On camera, the moment of birth at about 6:35 p.m. EDT is obscured, but the results become immediately obvious from the new cub’s robust squealing. The massive mother immediately picks up and cradles the infant, which officials said is the size of a stick of butter. “We can tell the cub is doing well from its vocalizations and the mother’s behavior,” Smith said. Zoo staff remain ready to intervene if something seems wrong, but Smith said Mei Xiang, who has reared three cubs to adulthood, “knows exactly what she is doing.” For now, zoo staff are letting the new pair share some private time. Mei Xiang will remain with her baby (gender still unknown) in a small indoor enclosure where she has built a modest nest. For about a week, the new mother will not leave the baby’s side even to eat or drink. The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of life. For now it is pink and hairless; the distinctive black and white fur markings come later. Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure. Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The COVID-19 pandemic has done what 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew couldn’t do: It forced The Miami Book Fair to cancel its annual weeklong book frenzy at Miami Dade College’s Wolfson Campus for the first time in 37 years. But the show will go on virtually – and it will go on for free. The transition from live to virtual fair, which will feature programs in English and Spanish, has been a painstaking process, said program director Lissette Mendez. Some events will be available on the website for one night only; others might linger online longer. All the usual genres will be represented – fiction, politics, history, memoir, comics, poetry, Caribbean works with a focus on Haiti – in addition to robust children’s programming. Mendez envisions it as “Netflix for books” accessed through a new and upgraded website. Participants sign in with their email and create a password, and the site will take them to a list of programs, panels and conversations that they will view the way they would view their Netflix catalog. Click on what you want to see, and the link will take you to a YouTube-like page where you watch the event. The fair, which runs Nov. 15-22, kicks off with Margaret Atwood (“The Handmaid’s Tale,” “The Testaments”). More than 171 English-language authors and 80 Spanish-language authors have signed up, with more to be added over the next few weeks. The website is expected to go live sometime in September, at which point you can create a watch list of the events you’re hoping to see and sign up for emails letting you know when new authors have been added.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia on Saturday became the 10th state in the nation to report that it has surpassed 5,000 deaths caused by COVID-19. The Georgia Department of Public Health said there have been at least 5,092 deaths in the state caused by the coronavirus and more than 252,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Data kept by the Associated Press showed the coronavirus has been spreading in Georgia faster per capita than any other state over the past two weeks, although infection numbers have been declining in the state since their peak last month. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was among the first governors to ease earlier restrictions this spring, highlighted the downward trends this past week. He has used social media to remind residents to wear a mask, maintain social distancing and follow guidance from the health department.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: Several dozen U.S. veterans will gather on a battleship in Pearl Harbor next month to mark the 75th anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II, even if it means the vulnerable group might be risking their lives again amid the coronavirus pandemic. The 75th anniversary was meant to be a blockbuster event, and the veterans have been looking forward to it for years. There were to be thousands of people watching in Hawaii as parades marched through Waikiki, vintage warbirds flying overhead, and gala dinners to honor the veterans. Now, most in-person celebrations have been canceled over fears the virus could infect the veterans, who range from 90 to 101. But about 200 people, mostly veterans, their families and government officials, will still commemorate the milestone on the USS Missouri, which hosted the surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay. It comes as Oahu – Hawaii’s most populated island and the home of Pearl Harbor – has seen an alarming spike in coronavirus cases in the past two weeks, forcing many restrictions to be reinstated, including a ban on gatherings of more than five people and the closure of all beaches. Officials plan to keep the veterans socially distanced while they are honored in front of livestreaming cameras instead of live crowds of thousands, as was first planned. Hawaii is expected to grant modified quarantine orders for those traveling for the anniversary, allowing them to attend the official ceremony and other events. Otherwise, people coming to the islands are required to quarantine for two weeks.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho will remain in the fourth and final stage for reopening the economy for at least another two weeks as coronavirus infection rates and hospitalizations remain too high, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor spoke at the Idaho Foodbank in Boise, where he emphasized the need to support food banks during the pandemic when many people have lost jobs. He said $2.56 million in federal coronavirus relief money will be made available to the Idaho Foodbank for use throughout the state. “More and more Idaho families are turning to their local food banks and food assistance programs during the coronavirus pandemic,” Little said. Idaho Foodbank officials said they saw a 10% to 50% increase in food demand when the pandemic reached the state in March and the economy started shutting down. “We are experiencing increased food insecurity in our state,” Idaho Foodbank President and CEO Karen Vauk said. Little also said that $10 million of relief money would go to long-term care facilities to keep residents safe during the pandemic. Little said the state has sufficient ICU beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment. He also said the number of people being admitted to hospitals is stabilizing, and that positivity test rates are falling.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Illinois’ incoming high school seniors have been struggling to register for standardized testing ahead of college application season after the coronavirus pandemic caused testing dates to be canceled. Students weren’t able to take the SAT at schools in April, and ACT tests in the spring and summer were canceled after sites closed, the Chicago Tribune reported. ACT executive Shane King said the company relies on schools for testing sites, but shutdowns made that impossible. He also can’t guarantee that locations booked for September and October won’t be canceled. Clay Lindner is one senior who secured a spot to take the ACT. But like some, he was assigned to a site in another state. He registered to take the test in Chicago but was transferred to a site in Jonesboro, Arkansas. ACT officials said location changes were because of a computer bug that has been fixed. But Lindner didn’t want to risk it, so he grabbed a spot in Louisville, Kentucky, near homes of extended family members. The SAT, the ACT’s main competitor, tried a different approach. The College Board, which administers the exam, allowed seniors to sign up early for tests that will resume Aug. 29. Some students said they were able to register for an SAT test after they couldn’t land a spot for ACT testing. Evanston senior Josie Hansen was offered a spot in Michigan to take the ACT after two previous testing cancellations. But she decided to take the SAT in nearby Wilmette instead. Meanwhile, about 350 colleges have made assertions since the start of the outbreak that standardized test scores will be optional this year. But parents and students are not convinced that the lack of a good score will be a disadvantage at a competitive school.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After a monthslong break forced by the coronavirus pandemic, felony jury trials are set to resume in Marion County, home to Indianapolis and the state’s largest county court system. Marion Superior Court officials said major felony trials will begin this week, and lower felony, misdemeanor and civil trials would resume the week of Sept. 14. To protect jurors against the spread of COVID-19 during trials, the court said it is implementing assigned, socially distanced seating and requiring face masks. Jurors will also be provided personal hand sanitizers and sanitizer stations, as well as deep cleaning facilities. Prospective jurors are being asked to notify the jury pool coordinator if they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 30 days, are caring with someone with COVID-19 or will be self-quarantining on their summons date. Major felony trials will take place at the Marion Superior Court Traffic Court to accommodate larger jury pools. All other trials will continue to be in the City-County Building. Prospective jurors are asked to check their jury summons to make sure they report to the correct location.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa is cutting four athletic programs to cope with lost revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported that Iowa announced Friday that its men’s gymnastics, men’s and women’s swimming and diving and men’s tennis programs will be discontinued at the conclusion of the 2021-22 academic year. “We are heartbroken for our student-athletes, coaches and staff,’’ director of athletics Gary Barta wrote in a letter announcing the moves. The letter also was signed by university president Bruce Harreld. Finances are tight after the Big Ten decided to scrap plans for a fall sports season because of the coronavirus crisis. The university will continue to honor all existing scholarships through graduation for student-athletes who choose to remain at Iowa and will assist student-athletes who wish to transfer to other institutions “in every way possible.” Iowa previously announced reductions in compensation for all athletics department personnel and cuts in operational expenses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The number of inmates who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a jail in Wichita has grown to more than 500. The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office has conducted mass testing of its inmates at the urging of state health officials. As of Friday, 523 inmates have tested positive and 747 negative, KAKE-TV reported. “As results were received, inmates were separated and housed based on the results of their tests to minimize the spreading of COVID-19,” Lt. Tim Myers said. “Inmates that have reported symptoms of COVID-19 have received treatment from the contracted medical provider. No inmates have required hospitalization because of testing positive for COVID-19.” Inmates with no symptoms are considered recovered 10 days post-test. Myers estimated that around 400 inmates will be considered recovered by the end of the weekend. “We are continuing to maintain sanitization standards to take care of our staff and inmates which include issuing extra soap, and having disinfectant available as needed.” Myers said all staff members have been issued masks, and all inmates have been issued face coverings for the last several months.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A school district that reopened to in-person classes last week announced Friday that it would switch to virtual learning until at least Sept. 8. Green County Superintendent William Hodges said in a social media post that the move was because of increased coronavirus activity in the community, news outlets reported. “We have had a great week in our school system and are unaware of any student cases, but the increase in community cases has caused us to reach our threshold for transitioning into the ‘red phase’ of our reopening plan,” the district wrote in a Facebook post. Students returned on Aug. 17, despite Gov. Andy Beshear recommending that school districts wait until Sept. 28 to hold in-person classes. Meanwhile, Kentucky reported 785 new coronavirus cases Friday, including 97 youngsters ages 18 and under. Eight more virus-related deaths were reported, raising the statewide death toll to 864.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Sixty percent of Louisiana’s parishes will continue to receive information about residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus under a data-sharing agreements they signed with the state – even as questions arise about whether local officials should continue to receive the personal health details. Louisiana’s health department sends lists of people with positive tests and their addresses to local emergency officials to help first responders know they will be interacting with someone infected with the virus. The agency required parish officials to sign data-use agreements outlining limits on disclosure of the information after two rural parishes appeared to misuse lists they received, raising concerns they may have violated privacy laws. The state began sharing positive test result lists in the early days of Louisiana’s coronavirus outbreak, when first responders had shortages of personal protective equipment and were rationing masks, gloves and other gear. The health department said giving local officials lists of people who tested positive for the virus helped law enforcement and emergency workers know when they should use that limited protective equipment because they’d be encountering someone who had the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus. Those shortages are largely gone – and COVID-19 has spread across Louisiana in larger numbers, so the lists don’t truly show the footprint of the virus outbreak. Public health officials say first responders should act as though anyone they encounter could be carrying the virus, because so many people are asymptomatic and may never get tested.\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: One of the people who tested positive for the coronavirus after a wedding reception in Millinocket has died, a hospital said. There are more than 30 cases associated with the Aug. 7 event but only one of them was hospitalized. That individual died Friday afternoon, said Robert Peterson, CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital. Because of the outbreak, the hospital is closed to visitors. Town Hall and schools also were closed. The reception at the Big Moose Inn exceeded the state’s indoor gathering limit, among other violations of state rules. The outbreak affected individuals from 4 to 78 years old, officials said. Friday was the 14th day since about 65 people – more than the limit of 50 – attended the reception. A representative for the Big Moose Inn has declined to comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean Pines:Staff will stay home and two pools will be closed in the Ocean Pines resort community after another staff member was found Friday to have contracted COVID-19. The worker, a member of the aquatics department, was last at work on Thursday, according to a post by the Ocean Pines Association on Facebook. Three OPA workers have now tested positive since April. “We have notified employees believed to have had close contact with the affected employee directly, and asked them not to report to work for 14 days,\" the Association wrote in a statement. \"For the rest of us, it is important to continue practicing sound hygiene practices by frequently washing hands thoroughly, maintaining 6 feet of separation between others, and wearing masks when indoors or when social distancing is not possible.\"\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBrockton: The city has enacted a curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus after state health officials deemed it a “higher risk” community. All residents and visitors in Brockton are to remain in their residences between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. The curfew doesn’t apply to essential workers. Violators are subject to a $200 fine for the first offense, $350 for a second, and up to $500 for a third. Mayor Robert Sullivan signed an executive order mandating the curfew on Friday. In the order, he noted that the city’s infection rate has been 8.5 cases per 100,000 residents for the past two weeks – an alarming figure that prompted state officials to designate Brockton as “higher risk.” The city of nearly 100,000 is located 25 miles south of Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nKalamazoo: A federal judge on Friday refused to block a requirement that Michigan’s migrant farm workers get tested for the coronavirus, rejecting claims that it violates the rights of Hispanics. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a handful of workers, as well as some fruit producers. But farm worker advocates told the judge they’re in favor of the tests. Compliance starts Monday under an order from the state health department. “The emergency order is facially neutral,” U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney said. “It applies to all owners and operators of migrant housing camps and all agricultural employers, as defined in the emergency order, with over 20 workers on site at a time. … The emergency order does not mention Latinos or any other racial classification.” The state said the tests are intended to protect vulnerable people who live in close quarters. “The department welcomes today’s ruling by a federal court rejecting an attempt to undermine this critical program to save lives,” director Robert Gordon said. There have been virus outbreaks since April at a poultry farm, an asparagus farm, a meatpacking plant and other agricultural sites, according to the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel wants to delay reopening campuses in the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester for two weeks in the wake of COVID-19 outbreaks at other U.S. colleges. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Gabel announced her proposal Friday. The Board of Regents is expected to consider it on Monday. The plan comes on the heels of outbreaks at schools such as the University of North Carolina and Notre Dame. White House Coronavirus Task Force leader Dr. Deborah Birx has said colleges should be able to conduct 10,000 tests per day. Right now the University of Minnesota plans to test only students who are symptomatic or have been exposed to someone who has been infected. “If the university’s best plan is that students aren’t going to go out and party, then I don’t think that’s a solid plan,” said Amy Ma, the Twin Cities campus’ student body president. Classes begin Aug. 31 in Duluth and Sept. 8 at the other two campuses. Under Gabel’s plan, classes would start on time but would be delivered completely online. Dorms would be closed for the first two weeks of the semester, with housing and dining contracts prorated. Students would be allowed to cancel their housing contracts or defer them to the spring.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:Dozens of Oak Grove High School students staged a walkout Friday to protest what they believed are lax rules around COVID-19 precautions and the handling of an alleged racially charged incident. Faith Jones, an Oak Grove senior, said the students came to school Friday with a plan to walk out. \"Oak Grove is extremely reactive and never proactive,\" she said. The protest was planned after a senior photo was taken Aug. 13 during a celebration of seniors at the start of the school year. Students wore masks until it was time to take the photo, but were crowded together despite Gov. Tate Reeves' mandate on social distancing. Parents were then notified by the district that \"an individual in your child's class, group or team has been diagnosed with COVID-19.\" The letter was not signed, but was printed on school district letterhead. Lamar County Superintendent Tess Smith said Friday she could not comment about the district's COVID-19 cases and declined to answer a question about the number of students notified of possible exposure. Also during the senior event, a video posted to Facebook showed students allegedly yelling \"white power\" during the senior run on the football field. Smith said the school is still investigating the incident. Students were warned before the walkout that they could possibly face disciplinary action for leaving class during school hours.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: St. Louis County will expand its requirement on face coverings, including a requirement that all students kindergarten through high school wear one. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the new guidelines were announced Friday. The guidelines are effective starting Monday. The school regulation applies to private and public schools, for all students in kindergarten through 12th grade. They can remove masks for physical education, choir or music class, during school-sponsored sports, or while eating, as long as they remain 6 feet apart. Beyond school, children 6 or older will be required to wear face coverings in public. A previous order applied to children 10 or older. The new regulations also require businesses to deny entry to customers who refuse to wear face coverings. A previous order authorized businesses to deny entry, but did not require it. St. Louis County has reported 16,758 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 700 deaths. Both figures are the most for any county in the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: More than 30 inmates at the Yellowstone County jail have tested positive for COVID-19, an inmate at the Cascade County regional jail in Great Falls has also tested positive and a resident died at a long-term care facility in Flathead County where there has been an outbreak of the respiratory virus, officials said. Thirty out of 70 men in one housing unit at the Yellowstone County jail tested positive, Sheriff Mike Linder said. Those who have tested positive are being isolated but are not showing symptoms. In Great Falls, one inmate at the regional jail tested positive for COVID-19 after showing symptoms, Cascade Copunty Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said. In Flathead County, a resident of a long-term care facility has died of COVID-19, county health officials said Saturday. However, because of privacy laws, they are not identifying the facility. At least two facilities have announced cases. Fourteen residents and employees with Whitefish Care and Rehabilitation Center tested positive for COVID-19, executive director Reid Crickmore told the Daily Inter Lake on Thursday. Meanwhile, a nurse, a housekeeper and a maintenance worker at Immanuel Lutheran Communities in Kalispell tested positive for COVID-19, President and CEO Jason Cronk announced Friday. They had not shown any symptoms, he said. Residents of Immanuel Skilled Care Center and Retreat were expected to undergo testing on Friday and those results were expected within several days, Cronk said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Colleges throughout the region have changed some of their residence and dining hall operating procedures to minimize the risk of a coronavirus breakout. Many college leaders said they want their campus to be open for business because most students would rather be on campus than taking classes by computer from home. But the Omaha World Herald reported that the pressure is on administrators to pull that off safely. Megan Failor, Doane University’s director of residential life and education, said administrators this fall are bound to be concerned. “It’s definitely going to be a unique year,” Failor said. “I think any time there are changes ... that always causes some angst.” Failor said Doane has designated its Colonial Hall residence facility as an isolation place for students with positive COVID-19 tests, symptoms or significant exposure to someone who has the disease. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Piper Hall, which wasn’t used last year, will serve as an isolation residence hall for those who have tested positive for the coronavirus or show symptoms. Spokeswoman Leslie Reed said Piper is not a medical facility and those with serious symptoms will have to visit a clinic.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Teachers in Washoe County will receive free COVID-19 testing, the district said Friday. The tests will be done through a drive-through site with Renown Regional Medical Center. The district said it also hired an employee health nurse who will answer questions and determine if an employee has symptoms that would warrant a test. The district said it could not immediately say what the turnaround time for results will be. Results in Washoe County have been taking three days or more. Also Friday, the Washoe Education Association, the union representing about 2,500 district teachers, sent out information about filing a claim if an employee believes he or she contracted COVID-19 at work. Claims also must be filled out within seven days of getting a positive COVID-19 test. The union was encouraging teachers to document unsafe conditions and the timing and location of COVID-19 cases among students and staff.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLaconia: Motorcycle Week is underway in Laconia, but some bars and pubs won’t be serving customers. The annual event typically attracts thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts to the Lakes Region. Because of concerns about the coronavirus, Gov. Chris Sununu recently mandated that masks be worn at gatherings of more than 100 people, and has said that liquor enforcement officials will be out in force throughout the nine-day gathering. Although indoor dining is allowed, standing at bars is not; customers must be served while seated. Some bar owners brought in new chairs to comply, but others, fearing crowds and the potential for fines or the loss of their liquor licenses, decided to shut down for the week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Bills that would require the state to prioritize protective gear for long-term care facilities and increase pay for workers in those facilities advanced in the state Legislature on Friday. Health committees in the Senate and Assembly each passed seven bills that are a response to the coronavirus's devastating toll in the state's long-term care facilities. More than 7,000 residents and staff in those facilities have died, accounting for half of the COVID-19 confirmed deaths in New Jersey. One key bill advanced in the Senate committee but not in the Assembly. The bill, S-2798, would require all long-term care facilities to submit outbreak response plans to the Department of Health. Bills that address other recommendations, such as imposing harsher fines on facilities for infection control violations, were not discussed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico’s jobless rate has jumped to 12.7%, the highest for the state since the coronavirus pandemic began in the U.S. in March. The unemployment rate is up from 8.4% in June, reversing a steady downward trend since April, when the rate was 11.3%, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The U.S. unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11% in June. All major sectors in New Mexico experienced year-to-year job losses, the state Department of Workforce Solutions said in a statement. Industries like leisure and hospitality reported the largest employment losses. State Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley said the main reason behind the state’s unemployment rate increase came from temporary furloughs for workers that became layoffs as the pandemic persisted. The Albuquerque metropolitan area reported an unemployment rate of 13.1% in July. The Santa Fe area reported a rate of 13.5%, Las Cruces’ figure was 13% and Farmington had a rate of 16%, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A western New York couple’s big wedding is off – at least for now – after an 11th-hour court order in a fight between couples and the state over a 50-person limit on social gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. A federal appellate judge in Manhattan on Friday granted a state request that blocks Pamella Giglia and Joe Durolek from having the 175-person celebration they planned Saturday at a Buffalo-area golf club. The order from Judge Denny Chin, of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, leaves New York’s 50-person rule in place at least until a panel of appeals judges can hear arguments, which couldn’t happen before the planned celebration. One of the couple’s attorneys, Phillip Oswald, noted the order came after lengthy court hearings and lower court rulings in the duo’s favor. “It is unfortunate,” Oswald said in an email Saturday, that “a single judge from the appellate court cavalierly issued a two-page, four-paragraph order that prevented this couple from having their wedding in a manner that is no more risky than going to a restaurant, gym, museum, etc.” The couple’s attorneys said Durolek and Giglia were postponing their wedding. Messages were sent Saturday to representatives for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Attorney General Letitia James, whose offices are leading the state’s side of the case. On Saturday night, James’ office referred questions to the governor’s office. Cuomo’s office has not released guidance specific to weddings, but has said they are subject to the 50-person cap on social gatherings.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte are moving courses online in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the universities announced Sunday. ECU will move undergraduate courses online for the remainder of the fall semester, beginning Aug. 26. Undergraduate classes are suspended Monday and Tuesday at ECU to adjust to the change in the schedule. Professional and graduate courses will continue as they are operating at ECU. Fall classes began at ECU on Aug. 10. University residence halls will begin move-out this week with the conclusion on Aug. 30. The university will work with international students, student athletes and hardship cases who apply to continue to live on campus, the university said. UNC at Charlotte will begin classes as scheduled on Sept. 7, but it’s delaying the start of undergraduate and graduate in-person instruction for three weeks until Oct. 1. All instruction will begin as planned on the first day of classes Sept. 7, but will now be delivered online. UNC at Charlotte will continue to offer on-campus housing and dining services for students who are on-campus, international students and others with approved extenuating circumstances. Move-in to residence halls is scheduled for Sept. 26-29.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Passenger traffic is starting to pick up again at North Dakota’s airports but remains less than half of what it was a year ago before the coronavirus pandemic drove people into their homes. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state’s eight commercial airports saw about 5,000 passengers, or 5% of expected traffic, in April, the lowest monthly passenger count since record-keeping began 40 years ago. Passenger counts rose to 13,474 in May; 24,313 in June; and 39,660 in July. That’s still down 64% from July 2019, according to the state Areonautics Commission. Year-to-date boardings are down about 50% overall. The Federal Aviation Administration is providing more than $85 million in aid to 53 North Dakota airports through the federal coroanavirus relief bill. The Bismarck airport is getting more than $20 million.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Staff members at all Ohio assisted living facilities must undergo coronavirus testing under a public health order issued Friday that expands testing being done in nursing homes. The order, signed by interim Health Director Lance Himes, requires staff in such facilities to be tested and any residents who wish it. Ohio licenses 771 assisted living facilities statewide. The pandemic has struck the elderly living in Ohio’s long-term care facilities especially hard. More than 2,500 residents in such settings have died from the coronavirus in Ohio, or more than six of every 10 deaths statewide. DeWine was also expected to issue an order Friday on guidelines for performing arts facilities.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Face-mask mandates adopted in some communities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 seem to be working, according to a newspaper report. Data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health showed cities with mask mandates nearly cut in half their average number of new COVID-19 infections after three weeks, The Oklahoman reported Sunday. In Oklahoma, 17 localities have adopted mask ordinances, according to data compiled by the Oklahoma State Medical Association. On July 20, the rolling average of new COVID-19 virus cases in cities with mask ordinances was 457. By Aug. 12, that number had dropped 47% to 233, according to data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Areas without mask ordinances also saw a 28% drop in new coronavirus cases during the same time period. That drop was likely the result, in part, to some residents wearing face masks even where they aren’t required, the newspaper reported. Dr. David Kendrick of the University of Oklahoma’s School of Community Medicine said he’s also seeing indications that local mask mandates are reducing the percentage of COVID-19 virus tests that are positive. Kendrick, who is also the CEO of Oklahoma’s nonprofit health information exchange MyHealth Access Network, looked at six cities, including Oklahoma City and Tulsa, that have adopted mask ordinances. In the first seven days after a mask policy went into effect, the positivity rate dropped by 0.47%. After 14 days, the positivity rate dropped by 7.57% and by 21 days, it had decreased by 5.73%.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Coronavirus cases in Oregon have declined during the past month, but in order for schools to reopen, the average amount of new cases a day needs to decrease from 250 to 60, state health experts said Friday. In order to reach that goal, Gov. Kate Brown said residents will have to continue to follow and enforce current statewide COVID-19 safety mandates or else bars and restaurants may have to close and travel restrictions will be implemented. The Oregon Health Authority reported 259 new cases Friday as the state’s total case count rose to 24,421. The death toll is 414. Dean Sidelinger, the state’s epidemiologist, said that since July, transmission of the deadly virus has slowed. Hospitalizations also declined last week, from 143 to 115. The percentage of positive tests has leveled off too – remaining at 5.4%. In June, Brown issued an executive order that allowed in-person learning at public and private K-12 schools only if it they met guidance issued by the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Education. One of the guidelines requires a statewide and a county-wide testing positivity rate of 5% or less, as well as 10 or fewer new cases for every 100,000 people in the county where the school is located.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPottsville: U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser has said he is postponing public events after testing positive for the coronavirus. Meuser, a Republican, said he is following guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and working from home in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. “I am thankful to God that my grown children were not at home and that my wife Shelley has tested negative,” said the congressman, who represents a portion of east-central Pennsylvania, in a statement. Meuser said because of the quarantine he will not be voting on the bill regarding postal services but would have voted against the measure, saying calls to direct $25 billion to the postal service “are not reflective of the data or the reality of the situation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s arts sector lost more than 10,000 jobs and more than $436 million in sales from April until July as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recently issued report by The Brookings Institution. In Rhode Island and across the nation, arts venues and events were among the first to shut down and will be among the last to reopen in response to the pandemic, according to a statement Friday from Randall Rosenbaum, executive director of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. “This report documents how, in just four short months, the arts sector nationwide and in Rhode Island has literally ground to a halt,” he said. “Theaters and concert halls and museums were shuttered, and artists and cultural workers lost their livelihoods.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants lawmakers to simply copy and paste last year’s spending plan for the current budget year, asking state agencies to prepare for possible cuts if the economy continues to struggle amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The roughest of estimates by state economists said South Carolina might collect a little extra money in the fiscal year that started July 1. If that happens, the state should bank it until the COVID-19 uncertainty eases, McMaster told his Cabinet on Thursday. “The $1.8 billion revenue surplus we had estimated evaporated almost overnight,” McMaster said. Lawmakers said they will listen to the governor’s request, but aren’t committing to anything yet. With schools starting back, South Carolina faces a crucial point in its economic recovery and COVID-19 response. After two months of first rising COVID-19 cases, then a spike in deaths, the numbers have taken a turn downward. South Carolina is now averaging less than 800 new cases a day, the lowest level since mid-June, when a massive increase in cases experts blamed on a lack of mask rules, reopening businesses and Memorial Day parties.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Hundreds of Sioux Falls students didn’t participate in online learning last spring and all but vanished after the coronavirus pandemic drove the district to close classrooms. Keloland.com reported 700 children, or 3% of the district’s student body, never connected with their teachers during the last quarter of the year. Assistant Superintendent Teresa Boysen said the district tried to reach out to the students but never connected with them. She said phone numbers and emails changed and some students moved to different towns so they would have someone to take care of them while their parents kept working. Boysen said some students who returned have been catching up on their work in summer school. She said the district has been updating contact information in case schools have to close again this fall. “Teachers will work with the students to take their devices home, practice getting connected and this is what we have to do in case we have to jump out,” she said. School begins on Thursday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will provide an additional $300 per week in federal assistance to people who are unemployed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it has approved Tennessee’s request for a grant to give to people on top of their regular unemployment benefits. The Lost Wage Assistance grants have been awarded to nearly half of the states. President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month making the money available. It was announced as a $400-per-week benefit, but put the burden on the states to pay $100 a week of that amount. The U.S. Department of Labor issued recent guidance saying states would not have to contribute that money. Trump’s order came after a $600-per-week federal unemployment benefit expired at the end of July, without a new bill for pandemic relief being reached.\n\nTexas\n\nBrownsville: Efforts by officials in Cameron County to delay the start of in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic could face a legal challenge on claims of religious freedom. The county, which has been one of the many COVID-19 hot spots in South Texas in recent months, has delayed in-person classes at public and private K-12 schools until after Sept. 28. But attorneys for two private religious schools have told the county that the order is unlawful and goes against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s June 26 executive order superseding the authority of local governments to issue orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus if they conflict with the governor’s own orders, the Brownsville Herald reported. Laguna Madre Christian Academy in Laguna Vista and Calvary Christian School of Excellence in Harlingen plan to open for face-to-face classes on Aug. 31 and Sept. 8, respectively. Last month, Abbott said Texas counties don’t have the power to preemptively shut down campuses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Abbott said that power rests with local school boards and state education officials. Jeremy Dys, an attorney with Plano-based First Liberty, which represents the two schools, told officials in a letter that “any effort by Cameron County to enforce its unlawful order … will be viewed as an affront to the religious liberty of (the two schools) and met with the strictest legal defense.” Daniel N. Lopez, an attorney for Cameron County, said in an Aug. 20 letter that officials were not opposed to granting Laguna Madre Christian Academy an exemption because the school is small and it came up with a plan that meets state guidelines for reopening. But Calvary Christian School is larger and its reopening plan was still being reviewed, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The annual Christmas concert by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ choir has been canceled because of lingering concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. It will the first time since the holiday concert began in 1974 that the show has been canceled, said Kim Farah, a spokeswoman for the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. The cancellation announced Friday by church officials is the latest sign that disruptions to normal religious activity will continue through the holidays. The Utah-based faith previously announced it would hold its twice-yearly signature conference in October without in-person audience as it did at the April conference. The faith has limited activities at temples and allowed regular Sunday worship services to resume only where it’s allowed under local government rules and without safety measures. It’s missionary program has shifted to focusing on online faith outreach. The Christmas concert that has been canceled usually brings brings thousands to the faith’s 20,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City and features guest performers such as Broadway star Kelli O’Hara and actor Richard Thomas. It has been held for decades without disruption. The choir, previously known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, also announced the cancellation of two other fall concerts and auditions.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has extended until the new year its emergency rules for how courts operate in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The judicial emergency declared in March means that jury trials are not being held and many court hearings are taking place online or over the phone, the court said. People must go through a health screening before entering a courthouse, wear a facial covering and stay at least 6 feet away from others. “The Court has extended the judicial emergency to January 1, 2021 in recognition of the fact that the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic will continue to impact court operations and to require changes to court operations and rules,” the Vermont Supreme Court said when it announced the extension last week. The court also made changes to allow individuals participating in proceedings other than hearings access to court buildings.\n\nVirginia\n\nSalem: Roanoke College said it has removed six students for violating the student conduct code after three positive tests for COVID-19 that might have been related to an off-campus party. The Roanoke Times reported that four students have tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus. The first was tested last weekend, as students began to move in, and the student had withdrawn from classes before the test result came back. The other three have been moved to an isolation area on campus. Others who might have been exposed to them are quarantining in their rooms, and people they might have been in contact with have been notified, the college said. Online classes at the private college began Wednesday. Students continue to filter into residences in a phased plan the college announced earlier this summer. Classes are supposed to transition to mostly in-person instruction by Sept. 7. The Roanoke College announcement follows actions by Virginia Tech and Radford University. Virginia Tech suspended seven students Thursday after being alerted to large gatherings of students off campus. Radford suspended three students for failure to comply with that university’s COVID-19 safety measures.\n\nWashington\n\nPullman: The athletes weren’t the only ones affected when Washington State University’s fall football season was canceled by the coronavirus pandemic. Merchants in Pullman who depend on big football crowds said they are losing a major chunk of their annual income. Pullman, the most remote outpost in the Pac-12, has only 34,000 residents. Many businesses in town depend on visitors attracted by football games, graduation and other special events. The pandemic has led to the cancellation of many of those events, including seven home football games that annually provide a lifeline to hotels, restaurants and other retailers. Of Pullman’s 34,000 residents, about 20,000 are Washington State students and many of the rest are faculty and staff. Without the college, Pullman would be another small farm town amid the rolling hills of the fertile wheat country known as the Palouse.“We expect to be down 50 to 60% in annual sales this year,” said Bob Cady, owner of the Cougar Cottage, an iconic bar and restaurant in Pullman close to Martin Stadium, where the Cougars play their home football games. The cancellation of Mom’s weekend and graduation ceremonies last spring, and the recent decision by the Pac-12 to postpone the football season to next year at the earliest will devastate business at what is popularly called The Coug, Cady said. In reality, Cady has long expected the football season to be canceled.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: Attendance at West Virginia high school football games will be limited to family members of players and coaches during the first few weeks of the season. The Secondary School Activities Commission released guidelines Friday for sports competitions and extracurricular activities. The guidelines are based on the state’s color-coded reentry map for public schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The map uses four colors to classify the opening status of each of the 55 county school systems based on virus transmission rates. The system will be used during the first two weeks of the football season, which starts on Sept. 3. Immediate household family members will be allowed into football games involving counties in the green category, and only parents and guardians can attend games in counties in the yellow category. No games are allowed if a county is in the orange or red category.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A deputy with the Dane County Sheriff’s Office who is believed to have contracted the coronavirus while on duty has died. Sheriff David Mahoney said in a statement that Richard “Rick” Treadwell is believed to be Wisconsin’s first law enforcement officer to die from the virus after contracting it while on duty. The Journal Sentinel reported Treadwell had been with the department since 1995 and worked as a recruiter and instructor. The statement did not provide specifics but said “all evidence” indicated Treadwell contracted the virus while on duty. His body was escorted from a hospital Saturday to a funeral home by a law enforcement procession. He leaves behind a wife and three adult children. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming reported 61 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, officials said. The university tested more than 10,000 students and staffers ahead of the fall semester, which is scheduled to begin on Monday. Out of the 61 confirmed cases, 46 are still active as of Thursday and 15 people have recovered. Two of the 46 active cases are students who were living in dorms. They have since been isolated. Other students who were in close contact with the infected students are now required to quarantine for 14 days. Eight of the active cases are university employees who live off campus. The final 36 of the active cases are students who live off campus, many of whom officials said do not live in Laramie. School officials had initially planned to begin in-person classes immediately, but they decided last week that only some in-person education would start on Monday. The school said it plans on having all students returning on campus for in-person instruction by Sept. 28. The school plans to test all students and employees twice a week until then. “As we have seen across the country, many of our peers are having to pivot to online environments because of infection outbreaks,” university President Ed Seidel said in a statement. “We believe we have one of the best programs in the nation to monitor and intervene to limit the virus spread, so we can continue to offer a strong on-campus program.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/24"}]}

John Carney's 2023 State of the State: 5 things to know", "text": "Gov. John Carney promised to raise teachers' salaries, invest more in early education and confront Delaware’s worsening climate crisis in his State of the State address delivered Thursday at Legislative Hall.\n\nThis was the first State of the State speech, since the beginning of the pandemic, in which lawmakers both appeared in person and many didn’t wear masks – a stark contrast to the previous addresses. The body of Democratic lawmakers that sat before Carney’s sixth address is more progressive and diverse than last session, which could set up possible internal fights on legislative issues.\n\nWhile the speech laid out Carney’s priorities for the year, more details are expected to come next week when he reveals his budget recommendation.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the State of the State:\n\nPay increases for Delaware teachers\n\nMuch of Carney’s speech focused on education, both to retain teachers and expand early childhood development.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBACKGROUND:Delaware governor wants to raise teacher salaries up to 9% in the next fiscal year\n\nEarlier this week, the governor announced that his budget recommendation will include a 9% pay increase for teachers, many of whom are leaving the state due to burnout or higher pay elsewhere.\n\nDelaware, as of now, has the lowest average starting salary in the region.\n\nAn increase in education funding\n\nCarney also noted how many students are not at reading and math proficiency levels. The state Department of Education reported in August that the average proficiency across all subjects and assessments was still lower than before the pandemic.\n\nThe average math proficiency across all public and charter schools was 30% in 2022, while 42% of students were proficient in English language arts.\n\n“Here’s the uncomfortable truth: Too many students are behind,” Carney said. “That’s especially true among our most vulnerable students.”\n\nINSIDE LEG HALL:Delaware lawmakers are back in session. What you need to know about shake-ups, new faces\n\nIn his announcement earlier this week, the governor pledged to increase opportunity funding to more than $50 million, which will go to low-income students and English learners at Delaware public schools. More money will also go to the Wilmington Learning Collaborative, a governing board that plans to oversee and improve outcomes for children in schools that are within city limits.\n\nCarney said his recommended budget will increase state money in early childhood education, specifically doubling the funding for the Early Childhood Assistance Program, which helps children ages 3 and 4 years old.\n\nConfronting the staggering number of open jobs\n\nOne of the biggest challenges facing Delaware is filling the number of open jobs in the state.\n\n“For my entire career in public service, we’ve been focused first on creating jobs,” Carney said. “There have always been more people looking for work than jobs available.\n\n“Today, it’s just the opposite. We have thousands more job openings than we have people looking for work.”\n\nThe governor said Delaware businesses have 37,000 job openings, but only 21,000 residents looking for a job. There are 2,000 openings just among state agencies.\n\n“I’ve never seen a situation like this before,” he said.\n\nTo beat this, Carney said, the state will need to keep more University of Delaware and Delaware State University graduates in the First State.\n\nInvestments in affordable housing\n\nFederal funding, Carney said, will go toward rehabilitating blighted homes in buildings on Wilmington’s East Side, an issue the city has tried to confront for years.\n\nThe state and Wilmington officials hope to “reenergize” the community neighboring the new Bancroft school, he said. Similar housing investments will be made in Dover and Milford.\n\nThe governor added that more affordable housing investments will be announced in his budget presentation.\n\nA focus on electric vehicles\n\nCarney ended his address by focusing on the environment, in which he said Delaware’s “natural heritage is under threat.”\n\n“The effects of climate change and sea level rise on Delaware communities are real,” the governor said. “We’re seeing them every day.”\n\nHe said federal funding will go to building an infrastructure for the charging of electric vehicles, which environmentalists say are more eco-friendly and less dependent on fossil fuels. Republicans have previously killed legislation that would have added more charging stations.\n\nThe governor plans to “restore investments” to the Clean Water Trust, which addresses drinking water, wastewater and drainage needs.\n\nIn his more than 30-minute speech, Carney was his most passionate when speaking about roadside litter – his personal pet peeve.\n\n“You know by now how I feel about it. I can’t stand it,” he said. “I’ll often stop my car to pick up litter on the side of the road. It drives my passengers crazy.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/23/6-takeaways-gov-john-carneys-2020-state-state-address/4546430002/", "title": "6 takeaways from Gov.

Cannabis was not mentioned once, despite members from both parties working to expand medical marijuana access or legalize the plant.\n\nHere are six areas Carney said he wants the state to prioritize:\n\nSchools are still a priority\n\nThe governor's No. 1 priority this year will be continuing the state's $75-million-per-year \"Opportunity Fund\" for low-income students and English language learners in public schools. The fund is in its first of three years.\n\n\"Graduation rates for low-income students and English learners are the highest they’ve been in 10 years,\" Carney said.\n\nHe also mentioned the $50 million school set to be built in east Wilmington, and the planned renovation of Bayard on the west side of the city. He made clear that Wilmington schools were his priority.\n\n\"While students across our state need our attention, students in the City of Wilmington need our help the most,\" Carney said.\n\nThat wasn't lost on the lawmakers who think the governor needs to be spreading the love to Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nKNOW YOUR LAWMAKERS:Introducing 'Know Your Legislator,' a tool for learning more about your state lawmakers\n\n\"I understand the governor wants to put a lot of money in Wilmington and I understand the reason for that and I support that,\" said House Education Committee chair and Rep. Earl Jaques, D-Glasgow, in an interview earlier this month. \"But it's not the only place that needs resources.\"\n\nClean water, litter still environment priorities\n\nThe governor mentioned a recent deal he cut with Democratic leadership to pour $50 million into a trust fund to tackle the state's polluted water sources and flooding streets in the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nCLEAN WATER DEAL:Delaware officials propose $50 million investment for clean water needs\n\nThe effort will have a \"special focus on low-income communities,\" Carney said Thursday, without offering details. He will unveil his budget on Thursday, Jan. 30.\n\n\"Families in Blades, here in Dover — and across our state — deserve to know that the water coming out of their faucets is clean,\" Carney said.\n\nLast year, the state doled out $20 million for clean water initiatives.\n\nCarney also promised to continue his anti-litter campaign that was launched last spring, and to plant 1 million trees in the next decade.\n\n\"That’s a tree for every Delawarean,\" he said.\n\nThe terms \"climate change\" and \"sea-level rise\" were not mentioned in the 4,000-word speech, but the governor did say he wants 40 percent of Delaware’s energy to come from renewable sources by 2035.\n\nPush for some, but not all, gun control\n\n\"I encourage every member in this chamber to support legislation that would ban so-called ghost guns and high capacity magazines,\" the governor said during his speech.\n\nHe's referring to two bills that lawmakers are already debating. One would ban homemade and 3D-printed guns that can't be tracked by law enforcement or caught by metal detectors. Another would cap magazines at 15 rounds of ammo.\n\n'GHOST GUN' BILL ON THE MOVE:Bill to ban homemade 3D-printed guns heads to House floor\n\nSenate Democrats also are trying this session to ban certain semi-automatic weapons; and require a permit and training course to buy guns. Neither were mentioned in the speech.\n\nOver the summer, Carney appeared to have given up trying to pass the proposed ban for certain semiautomatic weapons because there weren’t enough votes, even though he supports the policy. At the time, he said a watered down policy, such as limiting access to the weapon, could be more palatable.\n\nAsking Dover to follow Wilmington's suit and tackle gun violence\n\nThe governor mentioned an initiative called the Group Violence Intervention project, which targets offenders by offering social services while still threatening prosecution in the hopes of deterring gun violence. The governor's administration took on the project with Wilmington officials in July.\n\nOn Thursday, Carney called on Dover to join the effort.\n\n\"We’re talking directly to Wilmington’s most violent offenders, but with a new and different approach. We’re challenging them to put down their guns and offering an alternative to a life of crime and violence.\n\n\"We need a similar approach here in our capital city,\" Carney said.\n\nLots of infrastructure promises\n\nThe governor reiterated his spending plan for the next fiscal year, which he referred to as using \"one-time revenue for one-time infrastructure projects.\"\n\nHe's also promising to propose the largest Bond Bill in the state's history for the second year in a row. Last year's Bond Bill cost nearly $863 million.\n\nCarney is banking on a revenue projection of an expected $200 million extra dollars from the Delaware Economic and Financial Advisory Council's projections. That could change between now and the end of June, when the budget must be passed.\n\nMORE SPENDING CASH EXPECTED NEXT YEAR:Lawmakers start 2020 session expecting more money, return to same controversial topics\n\nCarney also promised to invest $4.5 billion over the next six years to \"modernize our roads, bridges and public transit.\" He said there will be money for the construction of family courthouses in Kent and Sussex counties, along with \"$50 million in capital investments to further strengthen our economic infrastructure.\"\n\nLoan prepayments, tuition waivers\n\nCarney said he's also working with lawmakers to create a \"healthcare provider loan repayment program\" to \"attract some of the best and brightest young doctors to areas where they’re needed the most\" in Delaware. That legislation will come from Rep. David Bentz, D-Christiana, who chairs the House health committee.\n\nHe's also working with Democrats to let students who age out of foster care have tuition and fees waived if they attend Delaware Technical Community College, Delaware State University or the University of Delaware.\n\n\"There are perhaps no children more vulnerable than those in our foster care system,\" Carney said.\n\nSCHOOLS MAY HAVE TO TEACH ABOUT GENOCIDE:Delaware schools would have to teach about genocide, the Holocaust under proposed law\n\nLAWMAKERS SET NEW DEADLINE FOR BILLS:Delaware lawmakers are setting a new deadline for the legislative year", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2024/03/05/read-delaware-governors-final-state-of-the-state-speech/72266477007/", "title": "Read Delaware Gov. Carney's final State of the State address", "text": "Delaware Gov. John Carney delivered his last State of the State address at 2 p.m. Tuesday, March 5, at Legislative Hall in Dover.\n\nThe Democrat was set to give his State of the State address in January, but Carney fell ill and had to postpone the speech. The speech marks Carney’s last as Delaware governor. The state constitution prohibits the governor from running for a third four-year term.\n\nCarney already presented his 2025 proposed budget Jan. 25, which highlighted plans to address Delaware’s soaring health care costs; increase funding for education and professionals; continue investments in agriculture and environment; invest in housing and small business development; and pay for improvements in government infrastructure and buildings.\n\nCarney's term is up this year, but he is considering running for mayor in Wilmington.\n\nRead Carney's full address below:\n\nLt. Governor Hall-Long, Madam Speaker, Mister President Pro Tem, Senate Majority Leader, Members of the 152nd General Assembly and other elected officials, Members of the Cabinet, Distinguished members of the Judiciary, invited guests, and my fellow Delawareans.\n\nThank you for inviting me into the chamber today.\n\nLet me start by recognizing the historic nature of today’s event.\n\nFor the first time, a female Speaker of the House is presiding over the State of the State address.\n\nJoin me in recognizing Speaker (Valerie) Longhurst and her leadership team – Majority Leader Melissa Minor-Brown, Majority Whip Kerri Evelyn Harris, and new Joint Finance Committee Chair Kim Williams.\n\nI look forward to working with you all the rest of this session.\n\nI also want to take a moment to recognize two new justices on the Delaware Supreme Court – Justice Abby LeGrow and Justice Chris Griffiths.\n\nWe have a world-class judiciary in Delaware.\n\nJustice LeGrow and Justice Griffiths bring a new generation of leadership to our Courts.\n\nJoin me in thanking them for their commitment to public service.\n\nAnd a moment of personal privilege – if I may.\n\nI’d like to recognize my wife, Tracey, for all the hard work she’s done on behalf of Delaware children over the past seven years.\n\nTracey has transformed the role of the First Lady, we like to call her the First Spouse – and made sure every Delaware child has a First Chance to succeed.\n\nShe has also stood by me throughout my 30 plus years in public service. And let me tell you, it’s not always been easy.\n\nThank you, Tracey, for your support.\n\nBefore I go any further, I’d also like to recognize the Army and Air National Guard.\n\nGeneral Mike Berry is unable to be with us today, but he is represented by Brigadier General James Benson.\n\nIt’s been a busy time for the Guard – and I think a lot about their sacrifice.\n\nOver the past seven years, more than 1,300 Guardsmen and women have deployed to more than 50 locations around the world.\n\nLast year, we held a deployment ceremony for more than 150 Army National Guardsmen and women from the 160th Engineer Company.\n\nThey recently returned from a military operation in Southwest Asia.\n\nMembers of that unit who were deployed are with us today.\n\nPlease join me in recognizing our citizen soldiers. They’re the very best.\n\nIt’s hard to believe – but this is my last State of the State Address as Governor.\n\nAnd I think it’s worth a little reflection.\n\nOn what we’ve accomplished together.\n\nAnd on our unfinished business.\n\nFirst and foremost, we’ve helped create more than 30,000 new jobs since 2017. That’s a big deal.\n\nFor the first time in Delaware history, we’ve provided funding dedicated for low-income students and English learners in our public schools.\n\nWe’ve given teachers a BIG raise.\n\nFor three years running, we’ve implemented the largest infrastructure plan in state history. That means good jobs— building new schools, safer roads and bridges, and connecting Delawareans to the internet, up and down the state.\n\nAnd we’ve kept our fiscal house in order. We turned a $400 million dollar budget deficit in 2017 to $400 million in reserves. That’s a big deal.\n\nWe’re supporting an economic resurgence in downtown Wilmington.\n\nWe’ve provided paid leave for Delaware families – and raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour. The labor market has blown through that already.\n\nWe’re building more affordable housing units – so Delaware families have a safe place to call home.\n\nWe’ve reduced crime, and our prison population is down nearly 24%.\n\nWe passed sweeping climate change legislation – committing to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nAnd we’re keeping our communities safe, by banning assault weapons and launching targeted gun safety measures.\n\nThese are issues that matter to Delaware families in each of your districts.\n\nAnd that matter to future generations:\n\nGood jobs.\n\nQuality schools.\n\nSafe and affordable communities.\n\nA cleaner environment.\n\nAnd responsible management of taxpayer dollars.\n\nIn this last year, I’m focused on leaving the state in a better place than I found it.\n\nWe should make sure the next governor is in the best possible position to succeed.\n\nAnd we should balance the budget and make sure our investments are sustainable in the long run.\n\nI want to thank everyone in this room for your partnership.\n\nWe don’t always agree.\n\nBut working together is what we do best in Delaware.\n\nBecause of our hard work together, I can confidently say that the State of our State is strong. And getting stronger by the day.\n\nAs many of you know, I spent a lot of time on the football field. As a player and as a coach. I know, it was a long time ago.\n\nBut one thing I learned, is that the best teams leave it all on the field.\n\nIn that spirit, I want to talk about some of our unfinished business.\n\nAnd the work I believe we can still accomplish together.\n\nWe’ve made big strides on financial management. I want to recognize Senator Paradee and Representative Carson for their good work last year, as well as our Bond Chairs, Senator Walsh and Representative Heffernan.\n\nBut, despite our efforts, we did not pass legislation to permanently control operating spending at sustainable levels.\n\nAn earlier General Assembly rejected my proposed Constitutional amendment that would have done just that.\n\nIt’s really pretty simple.\n\nDelaware can’t compete in the future if we don’t have our budget in order.\n\nRight now, a future General Assembly, or a Governor, could lead us down a path of uncontrolled spending.\n\nThat would lead to higher taxes, and painful cuts.\n\nSo let’s not go backwards. Instead, let’s build on the progress we’ve made.\n\nThis year, I’m asking you to send me legislation that would make our spending benchmark permanent.\n\nI won’t be here next year. But most of you will.\n\nDon’t set yourselves up for failure.\n\nI hope we can find common ground on this important priority for every Delaware taxpayer.\n\nWe also have a serious issue with health care cost inflation.\n\nThis year, between Medicaid and our insurance plan for state employees and retirees, we’re spending nearly $2 billion on health care alone.\n\nLet me say that again: $2 BILLION– with a B.\n\nAnd that’s roughly $200 million more than our costs last year.\n\nThe state’s share of Medicaid alone costs $1 billion.\n\nThose are jaw-dropping numbers.\n\nIt’s almost a third of our state budget. It’s only going up – and taxpayers are footing the bill.\n\nIf we don’t get serious, health care spending will crowd out other investments.\n\nInvestments we all support.\n\nFunding for public schools.\n\nFor affordable housing and child care.\n\nAnd raises for state employees, and state retirees. Right now, retirees get their pay increases in the funding needed to cover their health care.\n\nThis is literally an issue we cannot afford to ignore.\n\nWe should all work together to strengthen our health care benchmark and address health care cost inflation.\n\nSenator Townsend and Speaker Longhurst, I know you and many in this room agree.\n\nI look forward to working together on those issues.\n\nOf course, no issue is more important to our state’s future than the quality of Delaware’s public schools.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time the last seven years focused on strengthening our schools.\n\nEspecially for children who need our help the most. I know Senator Sokola and many others have been leaders on this issue over the years.\n\nTogether, we created Opportunity Funding. A program that provides additional funding for low-income students and English learners.\n\nOur budget increases funding for this program to $63 million.\n\nI can assure you that it’s making a real difference.\n\nLast fall, I visited East Millsboro Elementary and spoke with a young student who had been struggling to read.\n\nWorking with a reading specialist funded through Opportunity Funding, she was improving by leaps and bounds.\n\nThat reading coach, Heather Ruark, is here with us today.\n\nJoin me in recognizing her good work.\n\nOver the past seven years, we’ve also built new schools across the state.\n\nWe’ve spent $1.5 billion on school construction alone.\n\nLet me tell you: a school is much more than bricks and mortar.\n\nIt’s the pillar of a community.\n\nAnd nowhere is that more true than on the East Side of Wilmington, where we’re building the first new school in the city in over half a century.\n\nThe old Bancroft school will be named the Maurice Pritchett Sr. Academy – after the school’s longtime principal, and community icon, Maurice Pritchett.\n\nI’m looking forward to the school opening later this year.\n\nStudents, teachers, and neighbors on the East Side will have a state-of-the-art school building they can take pride in.\n\nJoin me in recognizing members of the Pritchett family, who are here with us today.\n\nWe also launched the Wilmington Learning Collaborative to provide a hyper-focus on schools in our largest city.\n\nFor the first time, districts serving the city are working together to address the needs of Wilmington children. I also want to recognize Senator Tizzy Lockman for her work in this area as well. I know it’s a priority we both share.\n\nAnd finally, we have significantly expanded mental health services in our schools.\n\nThe need became even more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nI want to thank Speaker Longhurst for her leadership on this effort.\n\nWorking together, I look forward to expanding these services into high schools this year.\n\nThese are initiatives that we all can be proud of.\n\nBut it simply isn’t enough.\n\nHere’s an uncomfortable truth: statewide, less than 40 percent of children are reading proficiently at third grade. And many schools fall short of that average.\n\nImagine if YOUR child went to a school with that kind of result.\n\nNone of us would tolerate that.\n\nBut too many children across our state are faced with this reality.\n\nAnd we need to fix it.\n\nThat’s why my budget includes funding for a new team of literacy coaches.\n\nThey will work with educators and district leaders to focus on the science of reading – an effective approach to teaching children how to read.\n\nIt’s one of the most important things we can do.\n\nI hope you’ll join me in supporting this priority.\n\nMy budget also includes a continued focus on early childhood education.\n\nI know this is a priority that many of you share.\n\nOur priority is simple: create more seats for the children and families who need them the most.\n\nThe research is clear.\n\nIt shows that children who have access to quality early childhood education have better outcomes.\n\nThat includes higher graduation rates and more financial stability into adulthood.\n\nJust 15 years ago, the state was investing next to nothing in childcare.\n\nMy budget includes more than $135 million for childcare.\n\nThat’s a big deal – and these are critical investments that will benefit our children as they grow up.\n\nBefore I leave the topic of education, I want to recognize and thank Secretary Mark Holodick for all his hard work.\n\nMark was a teacher, a principal, and superintendent before he took on the job as cabinet Secretary.\n\nAnd his leadership has been tremendous.\n\nOver the past 19 months, Secretary Holodick chaired the Public Education Compensation Committee.\n\nThe group studied educator pay.\n\nAnd they presented a recommendation for paying our teachers what they deserve.\n\nI’m determined to win the competition with the states around us.\n\nWe want the best educators working right here in the First State.\n\nThat’s why my budget fully funds the first year of those recommendations for educators – building on the raise I signed into law last year.\n\nIf we stick to the plan, we will raise teachers’ starting salaries to $60,000 over the next four years.\n\nLet’s get it done.\n\nI would like to take a moment to recognize our Lieutenant Governor, Bethany Hall-Long.\n\nLt. Governor Hall-Long has been a real partner over these past seven years. She’s a nurse, as you all know. And her efforts on the ground during the COVID-19 pandemic were just tremendous.\n\nShe knows how to roll up her sleeves and get things done.\n\nThe Lt. Governor has also been a champion of science and technology and advancing STEM careers for young people in our state, particularly young girls.\n\nLast summer I signed Senate Bill 55, creating Delaware’s Rare Disease Advisory Council.\n\nThis new council will bring together the best and brightest to help support those living with rare diseases.\n\nThe effort was led by Lieutenant Governor Hall-Long, along with Senator Nicole Poore and Representative Krista Griffith.\n\nPlease join me in recognizing the Lieutenant Governor and the leaders of these efforts.\n\nI’d like to take another moment to recognize my wife Tracey for all her good work as First Spouse, especially her work on early literacy.\n\nSince 2017, Tracey has been focused on giving all Delaware children a “First Chance” to succeed.\n\nWorking with State Librarian Dr. Annie Norman, she helped expand Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library statewide in the middle of the pandemic.\n\nNow, more than half of eligible children are signed up for free books every month.\n\nAgain, there’s nothing more important than helping our children learn how to read.\n\nThis free program will help us to do just that.\n\nIn addition, last year, Tracey led a discussion on our trauma-informed progress. And she hosted our first youth mental health summit.\n\nIt takes all of us, working together, to make sure that Delaware children have a First Chance to succeed – from birth to adulthood.\n\nPlease join me again in recognizing Tracey’s great work.\n\nOf course, one of the best ways to expand opportunity is to keep our economy strong and growing.\n\nAs the saying goes, a good job solves a lot of problems.\n\nGood jobs help families pay the bills, buy a home, save for college and retirement – and sock away some money for vacation.\n\nGood jobs also increase our state’s revenue, and help us fund top priorities.\n\nOn my first day in office, I signed an executive order to rethink our approach to economic development.\n\nAnd together, we created the Delaware Prosperity Partnership.\n\nBy every measure, it’s been a success.\n\nJust in the last two years, we’ve created more than 20,000 jobs.\n\nThat’s a big deal.\n\nMy budget continues our investments in job creation.\n\nIn the Strategic Fund, Site Readiness, in Graduation Lab Space, and our Transportation Infrastructure Investment Fund.\n\nWe will not lose the competition with other states for good jobs.\n\nWe also have our eye on the future of Delaware’s economy.\n\nMy budget again includes additional funding for the federal research projects, NIIMBL and SABRE, at the STAR campus at the University of Delaware.\n\nBoth projects will build on Delaware’s strong foundation in science and technology.\n\nThey will attract more high-quality workers to Delaware and spur innovation and business development.\n\nYou all know this.\n\nBut our colleges and universities are more important than ever to the future of our economy.\n\nAt Delaware State University, Dr. Allen and his team have opened a new Early Childhood Innovation Center. The Center will train the next generation of early childhood educators.\n\nAnd at Delaware Tech, Dr. Brainard remains at the forefront of job training in our state.\n\nWe still have more jobs available than we have people looking for work.\n\nIt’s an issue you’ve heard me talk about before.\n\nRight now, there are 31,000 jobs available, but only 21,000 people looking for work.\n\nThat requires an intensive focus on job training – and on the skills demanded by Delaware’s employers.\n\nDelaware Tech is leading on that work.\n\nJoin me in recognizing Dr. Assanis, Dr. Allen, and Dr. Brainard and their teams for their hard work and dedication to the future of our state.\n\nWe are also exploring federal funding opportunities.\n\nAnd we’ve had success.\n\nLast year, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey were selected by the federal government for a hydrogen hub.\n\nThe program was funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy selected just seven proposals – out of 79 applications across the country.\n\nAnd we were one of the seven.\n\nThe federal designation will bring $750 million to the region.\n\nMake no mistake: this is a generational opportunity to build a clean energy industry right here in Delaware. And to compete for good union jobs of the future.\n\nWe also received $50 million in federal funding to help expand the Port of Wilmington.\n\nFor decades, jobs at the Port have been a gateway to the middle class for thousands of workers and their families.\n\nThese are the kinds of jobs our state and country were built on.\n\nWe are also increasing support for towns and cities.\n\nLast year, we celebrated additional funding to redevelop the once-blighted Nylon Capital Shopping Center in Seaford.\n\nWe’re building new affordable housing on the east side of Wilmington – and our Housing Director, Eugene Young, and his team are leading that work.\n\nAnd just a few weeks ago, we announced plans to supercharge the redevelopment of downtown Dover. That will help us attract workers to the area and expand economic opportunity in our historic capital city.\n\nI know that work is important to Senator Paradee, Representatives Harris, Bush, Lynn and many others.\n\nI appreciate your leadership and your partnership.\n\nIf we want to keep good jobs and workers in Delaware, we need to make sure families feel safe in their communities.\n\nI know fighting gun violence has been a shared priority.\n\nOver the past seven years, we’ve banned assault weapons, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.\n\nWe’ve passed red flag laws and prevented straw purchases.\n\nThis year, we’ll take another big step forward and pass the permit to purchase law.\n\nInside the administration, we’ve spent a lot of time on what we call Group Violence Intervention – or GVI.\n\nWe started GVI in Wilmington and have expanded the program to Dover.\n\nHere’s the truth: it’s a very small number of people who are committing the vast majority of gun violence in these communities.\n\nThey are part of groups that fight with one another.\n\nThrough GVI, we are directly engaging with those individuals and the gangs and groups they’re part of.\n\nWe’re demanding that they put down their guns.\n\nIf they do, we will offer job training and other social services.\n\nFor those who choose the path of violence, they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. And Attorney General Jennings has been doing that.\n\nMore than 300 people have participated in GVI since it started.\n\nJust in the last several months, we have started offering GVI services in Laurel – where we saw a spike in lethal shootings.\n\nWe are a committed partner in efforts to prevent gun violence in western Sussex County. The Delaware State Police has been instrumental in our response. And we appreciate the support of Representatives Dukes and Short and Senator Richardson in those efforts.\n\nThe future of our communities depends on it.\n\nAs we look toward the future, we can’t ignore the threat of climate change.\n\nDelaware is the lowest-lying state in the country.\n\nDrive through some of our coastal and back-bay communities and you’ll see it for yourself.\n\nIt’s clear we’re already feeling the effects of sea rise.\n\nThat’s why we’re spending more than $30 million to harden our coastal infrastructure.\n\nProjects like the one to raise South Bowers Road to make sure residents can get in and out of town during storms.\n\nThat’s pretty important.\n\nAnd I want to thank Secretary Majeski and Secretary Garvin for their leadership in this area.\n\nLast year, many of you were instrumental in passing the most significant climate change legislation in our state’s history.\n\nHouse Bill 99 set ambitious – but achievable targets.\n\nWe committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. And achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This is critical for future generations.\n\nI want to recognize Senator Hansen, Representative Heffernan, and Representative Phillips for their hard work and leadership on this issue.\n\nWe have a General Assembly full of leaders who understand the threat of climate change. And who have the political will to take action.\n\nThank you for your leadership.\n\nThe transition to clean energy won’t be easy.\n\nAt times, it will be controversial.\n\nIn December, DNREC finalized regulations to reduce transportation emissions in our state – a big source of carbon and other air pollution.\n\nBy 2032, the regulations require that 82 percent of vehicles delivered to Delaware be zero emission vehicles.\n\nThat will help us reach our targets under House Bill 99. And we’re following industry trends across the country.\n\nMajor automakers are already committed to moving toward electric vehicles.\n\nOur efforts will also make sure Delaware isn’t left behind in this transition.\n\nThe threat of climate change is also why we’re taking a fresh look at Delaware’s role in the offshore wind industry.\n\nIn December, we began negotiations with offshore wind developer US Wind to bring significant benefits to our state.\n\nAnd to take an active leadership role in offshore wind development.\n\nUnder terms of the agreement, US Wind would bring wind energy into Delaware.\n\nWe expect the agreement to bring more than $100 million in benefits to our state without raising rates.\n\nThose benefits include funding for workforce development. For dredging projects and for projects to mitigate the effects of climate change in our State Parks.\n\nOver the next several months, I hope you’ll join me in taking another big step forward.\n\nWe are pursuing legislation that will make Delaware more of an active player in offshore wind.\n\nIt will allow us to directly purchase wind-generated renewable energy. And to explore partnerships with states in our region.\n\nAnd Senator Hansen – I know this is a big priority of yours.\n\nWe look forward to working together on this very important issue.\n\nI want to end where I started – with some reflection.\n\nIt’s been a great honor for me to serve as your Governor.\n\nI believe the opportunity to serve as an elected official is the greatest privilege that a people can bestow on one of their own.\n\nOne of our colleagues who has enjoyed that privilege for 21 years is Representative Pete Schwartzkopf.\n\nJoin me in recognizing the former Speaker for his incredible service.\n\nThese last seven years haven’t always been easy.\n\nThe three years of the pandemic felt more like 10.\n\nBut for me, the privilege to serve as Governor has been an incredible gift.\n\nI got to travel to every corner of our state. And meet people where they are.\n\nIn fire houses.\n\nIn schools.\n\nAt festivals and parades.\n\nAnd during tragic circumstances, as well – like fires, natural disasters, and funeral testimonials.\n\nI’ve been privileged to listen to people’s hopes and aspirations.\n\nAnd to share in their good times – and their bad.\n\nI’ve learned that the most important thing for an elected official is to earn the trust of the people you represent.\n\nThey will give you the benefit of the doubt – so long as they trust you’re always trying to do the right thing.\n\nIf you earn that trust, they will follow you when times are tough.\n\nFinally, I want to thank, Tracey and our boys, Sam and Jimmy, for the sacrifices they’ve made during my time in public service.\n\nI couldn’t have done it without them.\n\nFor the rest of this year, we’ll continue to do the right thing.\n\nAnd working together, we’ll leave the state better off for generations to come.\n\nI look forward to leaving it all on the field in this last year.\n\nThank you for your hard work – and your trust.\n\nGod Bless You.\n\nAnd God Bless the Great State of Delaware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/21/carney-allows-delaware-weed-bills-to-become-law-without-signature/70133683007/", "title": "Carney allows Delaware weed bills to become law without signature", "text": "Gov. John Carney on Friday said he would let the bills to legalize marijuana and create a recreational industry become law without his signature, standing down from his aversions to recreational weed that put him at odds with his party.\n\nDelaware is the 22nd state to legalize recreational marijuana, after a nearly decadeslong fight by advocates and Democrats to enact these policies. Carney, in a statement, said he still believes legalizing weed is “not a step forward.”\n\n“I want to be clear that my views on this issue have not changed,” the governor said in a statement. “And I understand there are those who share my views who will be disappointed in my decision not to veto this legislation.\n\n“I came to this decision because I believe we’ve spent far too much time focused on this issue, when Delawareans face more serious and pressing concerns every day. It’s time to move on.”\n\nCarney said he could not sign these bills due to his concerns about the health consequences recreational marijuana will have on children, as well as roadway safety.

The General Assembly typically uses the governor's proposal as a blueprint for crafting the state's final spending plan.\n\nRELATED:Delaware out of the running for Amazon headquarters\n\nRELATED:Delaware Senate sends bail reform bill to Gov. Carney\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nLast year, Carney called for cuts across state government combined with a number of tax hikes to close a $386 million budget gap.\n\nDebate in the General Assembly about those measures led to a contentious finish to the legislative calendar missing a June 30 deadline but ending with a final spending plan that cut spending while raising taxes on real estate transfers, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nThe latest budget projections indicate those measures should result in nearly $88 million more in revenue than was expected for the coming fiscal year – just in time for an election cycle that will see 10 senate seats and all 41 house seats up for grabs.\n\nBut last year's deal failed to address larger structural deficiencies that are expected to eventually result in costs once again outpacing revenue, thanks largely to rising health care costs and growing enrollment in Delaware's public schools.\n\n\"It’s a simple math problem,\" Carney said Thursday. \"Our long-term growth rate for state spending is two times the growth rate of our revenues. We have to find a long-term way to limit our spending growth.\"\n\nThe governor called on legislators to resist the temptation of using one-time revenue windfalls to balance the budget and instead focus on structural spending reform.\n\nBut he also outlined several new initiatives aimed at improving the state's public education system, enhancing life in Wilmington and offering new benefits to state workers, all of which are expected to carry a price tag.\n\nNo proposed spending cuts were offered during the 30-minute speech.\n\n\"It was a great speech but I heard a lot of fiscal contradictions,\" said Senate Minority Whip Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley. \"He said we can't spend money we don't have, we can't rely on one-time money in the budget, we spend twice as much as we take in and, by my count 10 to 12 new spending initiatives.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf, D-Rehoboth Beach, said he is less concerned about the governor's new spending proposals.\n\n\"The State of the State is just an outline,\" he said. \"A lot of the answers will be filled in next Thursday when he rolls out his budget.\"\n\nEducation\n\nCarney's speech offered a preview of the governor's spending priorities for the coming year, many of which are focused on improving education for some of the state's youngest and most vulnerable students.\n\n\"The best thing we can do to invest in our state’s future is to invest in quality education for every Delaware child,\" he said. \"And we know that students are best prepared for success when they reach kindergarten ready to learn.\"\n\nThe state's final budget for this year included $26 million in education cuts.\n\nBut the governor said he will call on legislators to include more funding next year to cover the cost of hiring nearly 200 teachers statewide to account for an increase in students, as required by state law.\n\nCarney said he also plans to target additional funding to expand the number of math coaches in middle school across the state.\n\nThe Opportunity Grants program that in September spread $1 million across 13 schools that serve at-risk students should get more money, Carney said. He hopes to more than triple that number this year to help pay for after-school programs, reading interventions or other resources.\n\nAnd he will propose additional money for Delaware Stars for Early Success, which offers training for early child care providers and rates them on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Providers that improve can get reassessed and secure more funding through a tiered reimbursement plan tied to a program that helps working, low-income families pay for preschool.\n\nDue to last year's budget shortfall, early child care centers were stuck at their current reimbursement levels, regardless of how much time, energy and money they put into improving the quality of education they provide.\n\nCarney also highlighted his administration's efforts to help improve education in the five Christiana School District schools located in Wilmington.\n\nThe governor has offered the district an additional $18.5 million in funding to consolidate those schools into two buildings and enhance various programs. The Christina School Board has twice voted to table a memorandum of understanding with Carney and the state Education Department – most recently on Tuesday night.\n\n\"This may be the most difficult thing we do during this administration,\" Carney said. \"But it is clearly the most important.\"\n\nWilmington\n\nA long-time resident of Delaware's largest city, Carney highlighted numerous \"unprecedented\" efforts his administration has undertaken to make \"Wilmington strong again.\"\n\nThe city last year set new records for shootings and homicides and suffers from highest-in-the-nation gun violence among youth.\n\nThe state and city, Carney said, are working to implement recommendations from a 2015 report from the Centers for Disease Control that suggested agencies better share information and proposed linking schools with community health and social services, among other actions.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Health and Social Services, he noted, has launched a unit specifically dedicated to providing support for Wilmington’s struggling neighborhoods. Caseworkers are being stationed at community hubs. And probation and parole officers are working closely with the Wilmington Police Department.\n\nA key improvement the governor hopes to make this year centers on providing jobs to many of the city's low-skilled and underemployed residents.\n\nHe specifically referred to a plan to expand the Port of Wilmington and redevelop DuPont Co.'s former Edge Moor chemical plant into a new container import-export dock.\n\nThe Diamond State Port Corp. has received three proposals from private companies willing to undertake the work and management of the facility at no cost to taxpayers, state officials say.\n\nThe expansion promises to bring 5,000 new jobs to the area and up to $300 million in investment.\n\nCarney said he hopes to present a plan to the General Assembly for a new public-private partnership at the port in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We can’t undo decades of distress in Wilmington in a single year,\" he said. \"But working with the Mayor and city leaders, we’re determined to turn the ship around.\"\n\nState workers\n\nThe governor also spent a significant portion of his State of the State address discussing what he called an investment in state workers to \"treat them like the professional, dedicated workers they are.\"\n\nCarney teased a much-anticipated proposal to provide raises to many of the state's 30,000 employee – a common tactic in an election year. The state is the single largest employer in Delaware.\n\nThe governor also highlighted his support for legislation that would provide state workers with 12 weeks of paid parental leave, a rare benefit in the United States.\n\nThe governor is expected to include the roughly $2.5 million in funding needed to pay for the measure in his proposed budget\n\nFirst introduced in 2017, House Bill 3 would allow full-time state workers, including school district employees, to take up to three months of paid maternity during the first year after the birth of a child. Parents who adopt a child that is 6 years old or younger also would be eligible.\n\nCurrently, only three states – California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island – require private employers to provide paid family leave, including time off to care for sick family members. Seven others offer some form of paid family leave to state workers alone.\n\nThe Office of the Controller General estimates about 1,000 state workers a year, both men and women would be eligible for the paid parental leave offered by the bill.\n\n\"This is the right thing to do for our workers and for their children,\" Carney said.\n\nPerhaps the biggest bombshell of the speech came when the governor announced he and legislators are working on a bill that would create a student-loan forgiveness program for educators, an initiative he said would help retain teachers in some of the state's highest need schools and highest-demand subject areas.\n\nHe also said he would be proposing funding to upgrade state buildings in an effort to \"increase productivity and give us a happier workforce.\"\n\n\"State employees deserve to work in spaces that are clean and well-maintained,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, many state office buildings have fallen into disrepair, are poorly lit, and are in need of a little TLC.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/12/who-is-running-for-office-in-delaware-elections-2024/70302805007/", "title": "Delaware 2024 election: Who is running for office?", "text": "Even though elections are a year and a half away, statewide and local races are already heating up across Delaware.\n\nBefore U.S. Sen.

Schools could use this funding for things like after-school programs, reading interventions or other resources to help students and teachers be successful.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe budget\n\n“The budget smoothing task force is considering several good ideas to bring more fiscal discipline to our spending patterns. For the long term, we need structural spending reform, just as we need structural revenue changes. I want to continue working with the General Assembly – Democrats and Republicans – to do both. And, this is important, we cannot build new ongoing spending on top of one-time revenues. It’s just not responsible, and we can’t allow it, no matter how compelling the cause.”\n\nRELATED:Delaware's projected budget surplus grows ever so slightly\n\nEDITORIAL:Don't kick the can on Delaware budget reform\n\nHealth care\n\n“Here’s the bottom line. We’re spending too much money on health care and not getting the best results. We all need to come to the table – state government and hospitals most of all – and be part of the solution. The hospitals and other providers have been laying the groundwork for this effort for years. Now it’s time to make the hard decisions and change the way we deliver health care.”\n\nWilmington\n\n“I firmly believe that the strength of our state lies in the strength of our largest city. But as everyone here knows, we continue to face significant challenges in Wilmington that pose a threat to its long-term success. I’ve called Wilmington home for three decades. Tracey and I raised a family there. And I care deeply about its success. But we all have a stake in helping our city succeed. Its success is closely linked to the success of our state. That’s why, over the past year, Delawareans have seen this administration work with Mayor (Mike) Purzycki and members of Wilmington City Council to devote unprecedented time and attention to making Wilmington strong again.”\n\nWILMINGTON'S DEADLIEST YEAR:Mayor withholds 'serious concern' until plan takes hold\n\nWorkplace conditions\n\n“As part of our focus on improving workplace conditions for state employees, I directed Secretary (Sandy) Johnson to analyze our state’s current sexual harassment policy and training and to recommend ways to improve it. In the coming weeks, we will announce a series of changes to ensure that no state employee is made to feel uncomfortable or threatened at work.”\n\nDepartment of Correction\n\n“We have been working every day since February 2nd to make our prisons safer and to address the conditions that contributed to that terrible tragedy. Based on the Independent Review Team’s recommendations, we reached an agreement to increase salaries for Delaware’s correctional officers. We have implemented significant investments in equipment, recruitment, technology and training at the Department of Correction. And we’re installing cameras at James T. Vaughn and other correctional facilities as we speak. I made a commitment that the Independent Review report will not collect dust on a shelf. It has not.

He has cornered Democratic support in a deeply blue state, quickly raising more than $200,000 and capitalizing on three decades of government experience to secure the backing of virtually all of Delaware's top Democratic officeholders.\n\nAmong his most vocal supporters is Delaware Gov. Jack Markell, the same politician who in 2008 rejected pleas from Democratic Party leaders hoping to avoid a primary contest and went on to beat Carney that September and Republican Bill Lee in the general election.\n\nNow, a year from Election Day, no other Democratic candidates seem interested in challenging Carney, a tested candidate who has won five statewide elections as lieutenant governor and congressman.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"The experience, the number of times he's been on the ballot statewide, there is a comfort level that Democratic primary voters in Delaware have with Carney,\" said Erik Raser-Schramm, a longtime Delaware Democratic operative.\n\nEven Republicans are wary of launching a challenge.\n\nCarney's front-runner status is so cemented that Delaware Sen. Colin Bonini, the favorite to earn the Republican nomination, may walk away from his earlier expressed intentions to seek the Republican nomination for governor. Two Republican sources close to Bonini said he is instead eyeing a campaign for lieutenant governor, where he might have a greater chance against lesser-known statewide politicians.\n\nBonini's own internal polling shows him down more than 20 points against Carney, hardly surprising in a state where registration figures show there are 125,000 more Democratic voters than Republicans. Democrats control registration in all but a few conservative districts in Harrington, Selbyville, Greenville and Pike Creek.\n\nIn some areas of Kent and New Castle counties, Republicans are outnumbered by voters who do not identify with either of the major parties.\n\n“My message is going to be, if you like things the way they are, vote for John. If you think things need to move in a different direction, I’m asking for your vote,\" Bonini said recently, discussing his campaign strategy.\n\nDelaware's open 2016 governor race is the most significant, but will likely not be the most competitive, on next year's ballots. Three Democrats and two Republicans already are seeking Carney's congressional seat in Washington. Primary elections are scheduled for Sept. 13, with the general election nearly two months later on Nov. 8.\n\nThe Carper connection\n\nCarney's Delaware's political pedigree is unmatched among 2016 candidates – even if his executive branch experience says little about how he would address the political challenges of 2015, including a slow-growing economy and financial uncertainty in Legislative Hall.\n\nHe was deputy chief of staff and finance secretary to then Gov. Tom Carper in the 1990s, brokering tax deals and leading the administration's efforts in 1995 to secure the purchase of the Port of Wilmington from the city.\n\nCarney still draws on support from his time in Carper's office, when he worked alongside a tight-knit group of Democrats who have played significant roles in Delaware government and politics over the past three decades.\n\nCarney was hired into state government by Carper's chief of staff, Jeff Bullock, who was later tapped as Markell's secretary of state, a key Cabinet position that protects Delaware's billion-dollar brand as a leading legal home for U.S. corporations.\n\n\"I always admired his work ethic and his dedication to the job,\" Bullock said recently. \"When you're in a governor's office, you're asked to do a variety of different roles ... running the government day-to-day and carrying out the governor's agenda. So you need somebody who can take complex problems, figure them out and then implement whatever the solution is. That's John's greatest strength.\"\n\nDelaware Chief Justice Leo Strine, a lawyer in Carper's governor office, remains close to Carney, too, though he would not be interviewed for this story. He could be a key ally on criminal justice and other issues if Carney wins the governor's office. Two Democrats running to replace Carney in Congress also worked in the Carper administration. Delaware Rep. Bryon Short, a state lawmaker since 2007, was a young constituent relations aide and later a transportation official. Lisa Blunt Rochester served in Carper's Cabinet as labor secretary.\n\nAfter his tenure as a key Carper aide, Carney won two terms as Delaware's lieutenant governor, presiding over the state Senate and forging deeper bonds in the Delaware General Assembly. Since his defeat in the 2008 governor race, he has won three terms to Congress.\n\nThere are critical questions about how Carney would govern in 2016, a time of waning tax collections and exploding costs in health care and public education that are forcing difficult budget discussions in Dover.\n\nHis tenure in the Carper administration was vastly different, marked by a wealth of resources and a booming economy.\n\nThe DuPont Co. employed more than 20,000 people in Delaware. Gambling taxes poured into state coffers, increasing 371 percent during Carney's time in the Carper administration with the introduction of slot machines to Delaware's racetracks. And a roaring stock market meant millions more in revenue from new Delaware corporations.\n\nDuring his first year with Carper, in 1994, Delaware state spending rose 11.5 percent. \"I've told members of my Cabinet that we're not going to have this kind of spending growth in the future,\" Carper told reporters after midnight on July 1, 1994, after lawmakers passed the budget in Dover.\n\nEarly look: Delaware's 2016 political races\n\nBig challenges await next governor\n\nDelaware financial records show spending grew on average 8.9 percent through the second half of the 1990s under Carper, with Carney helping lead the charge. As finance secretary, Carney gained favor in the General Assembly by brokering budget deals that included dramatic tax cuts paired with increases in spending.\n\nIn 1999, lawmakers and the Carper administration enacted sweeping personal income tax cuts, gave tax breaks to seniors and raised spending 18 percent over two years, directing millions more to public education, Delaware's colleges and universities, prisons and the state bureaucracy.\n\nPredictably, the largesse won Carney friends on both sides of the political aisle in Dover. \"He was a good negotiating partner and certainly a man who comes ready to work,\" said Wayne Smith, the former Republican majority leader of the Delaware House of Representatives who negotiated budget deals with Carney. \"He tends to be moderate in his views, which I think makes him more of a centrist. That's what you want in a governor.\"\n\nSmith noted that, financially, the times have changed. Lawmakers negotiated past 4 a.m. on July 1 to balance this year's budget, tapping more than $30 million in one-time financial settlement money to cover just 2.6 percent higher operational spending.\n\n\"The tenor of the times could not be more different,\" Smith said. \"Back then we had more money than we knew what to do with.\"\n\nCarney would not agree to an interview, saying he remains focused on his work in Washington and is not ready to discuss his plans for the governor's office or his approach to problems in Dover. \"The congressman is focused on his work in Washington on behalf of the people who elected him,\" said Jessica Borcky, a spokeswoman for the Carney campaign. \"There will be plenty of time in the future to talk about the governor's race.\"\n\nCarney had not lost his bug for big spending by his second term in the lieutenant governor's office. During his last bid for governor, Carney proposed a universal health care program, funded with extensive Delaware taxpayer subsidies, but failed to identify a detailed price tag.\n\nHis plan included a \"major expansion\" of Medicaid, additional state insurance assistance for low-to-moderate-income families, and, to help foot the bill, higher taxes on cigarettes and businesses that failed to offer insurance to their employees. Delaware families of four making up to $103,250 might have qualified for new assistance.\n\nWith the passage of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, in 2010, the federal government made similar changes, including a Medicaid expansion paid for primarily at the federal level. \"I would hope that after a few years, we would be closer if not fully transitioned to universal health care for everyone,\" Carney said in rolling out his plan in October 2007.\n\nElecting Democrats they know\n\nKey Carney allies insist he is ready for the job and is uniquely qualified to negotiate deals in Legislative Hall.\n\n\"The hardest job in the government is being governor. He's coming back to accept that responsibility. He could have taken that train for the next 20 years,\" said Robert Gillian, the former Democratic House speaker who worked with Carney in the Legislature. \"He understands finances. He knows how to put a budget together, and he knows how to work with people. All those things are going to help him.\"\n\nCarper said Carney was an important member of his administration in the 1990s. He said Carney built relationships in Dover and was critical in negotiating a 1995 deal that secured the purchase of the Port of Wilmington, a move that had been panned by labor leaders in the city.\n\n“People in Delaware are fortunate that a person with his abilities and his integrity is willing to make this run. I respect him greatly,” Carper said in an interview.\n\nOn balance, Carney's political experience looks like an advantage. Delawareans already have a propensity to not only elect Democrats, but Democrats they know.\n\nFormer Delaware Gov. Ruth Ann Minner, who served in Delaware’s top office from 2001 to 2009, had been lieutenant governor during Carper’s eight years as governor in the 1990s. Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn was a lawyer for Minner, before winning two terms as lieutenant governor and securing the attorney general's post last November.\n\nIt is telling that Markell was considered an insurgent, outsider candidate in 2008, even after he served for a decade as Delaware's elected state treasurer.\n\n“It’s a little bit depressing for folks who might be on the outside and what we would call first-generation candidates,” Hoff said. “How do you get to the threshold of name recognition? Or come up with donors who can put you in the big leagues for funding of a serious campaign?”\n\nIt's a question that could play out in the 2016 race to replace Carney in Congress. Delaware Sen. Bryan Townsend, a Newark Democrat and corporate lawyer in Wilmington, has rallied the support of younger Democrats, but has less institutional backing than Short and Rochester, both of whom worked for Carper's gubernatorial administration.\n\nTownsend wears his independence as a badge of honor.\n\n\"People have reached out to me and said I'm very glad I'm not the next man up on someone's bench. People do want a fresh and independent approach to things,\" Townsend said.\n\nOn the Republican side, the situation is even more difficult for first-time candidates without deep political roots here like those propelling Carney's campaign. When Ken Simpler won the 2014 state treasurer's race, he became the first non-incumbent to win statewide office in two decades.\n\n“It has always struck me that it’s not necessarily beneficial to have a group of people who have not ever worked outside of government, running government,” Simpler said recently. “I think I bring some ideas different to the table because I didn’t grow up around the same water cooler.”\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.\n\nJohn Carney rakes in $200K at Hotel du Pont fundraiser\n\nFrom staff assistant to gubernatorial candidate\n\nCongressman John Carney, 59, of Wilmington, has risen through the ranks of political positions and is now running for Delaware governor.\n\n1986-1989: Staff assistant, Office of U.S. Sen.

He tweeted to ask about its derivation.\n\nDelaware Heritage Commission Chair Dick Carter points to the region's Dutch past.\n\n\"I've always understood that the name 'Murderkill' is taken from the original Dutch for Mother River,\" he said.\n\nMother is \"moeder\" in Dutch, and river is \"kill.\"\n\nLater, under British rule, the word \"River\" was added to the waterway's name, effectively making it \"mother river river.\" In a 2004 essay, Carter likened it to the harmless redundancy of saying \"pizza pie.\"\n\nHe also warns readers not to believe the popular website Wikipedia.\n\nIt quotes \"Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States,\" (1945) by George R. Stewart, but misspells his name and omits the title's hyphen. Wikipedia says, \"A tradition is preserved about the naming of the Murderkill River:\n\n\"...remembering how they had been served at the Whore-Kill, they went some ten or twelve miles higher, where they landed again and traded with the Indians, trusting the Indians to come onto their stores ashore, and likewise aboard their sloop drinking and debauching with the Indians until they were at last barbarously murdered, and so that place was christened with their blood and to this day is called the Murderer-Kill, that is, Murderers Creek.\"\n\nThe tale of an early trade/plunder run refers to the Lewes area of Sussex County – where the region and what now is called Lewes Creek earlier had other names including Whore-Kill – then to the meandering Murderkill that meets Delaware Bay between the modern town of Bowers and the unincorporated community of South Bowers.\n\nCarter considers Stewart's \"lurid tale of the origins of the name 'Murderkill'\" to be the wildest kind of folklore, but very much in keeping with a lot of the popular writing of that period.\n\nAnd \"Whore-Kill\" meant nothing like it sounds: It was originally Hoornkill and meant Hoorn River – \"named after Hoorn, Holland, the town from which some of the original Swaanendael settlers came.\"\n\nSwaanendael was the state's first settlement, wiped out at modern-day Lewes. Its old spelling is kept despite later Dutch language reform that gives a modern spelling of Zwaanendael, as in the Lewes museum.\n\nHistory buffs get bonus points if they know – and can explain – Swaanendael and Zwaanendael and that both mean \"Valley of Swans.\"\n\nOne more grisly name: \"'Slaughter Creek' comes from the early Delmarva family name 'Slaughter,' who were among the early English settlers in the area,\" Carter said, \"and not from some terrible massacre.\"\n\nDo you have a Delaware Backstory?

Some say the town was named after him, and some say there was once a creek that ran into the bay called Slaughter Creek in his honor.\n\nAnother legend, Lewis said, is that the name came from the annual arrival of horseshoe crabs, which often get flipped over in the surf and die. The town is now a horseshoe crab sanctuary, with plenty of helping hands to flip the ancient-looking creatures over as they breed en masse.\n\nThe final tale is that in the 1600s, there was a miscommunication between Dutch settlers and Native Americans, Lewis said.\n\n“That’s the hardest one,” he said. “They decided to show the Native Americans their god, and showed them their cannon.\"\n\n“But who knows why it’s really named Slaughter Beach,” he said. “It certainly isn’t named Slaughter Beach because anybody here is into slaughtering animals.”\n\nSlaughter Beach Mayor Harry Ward said on Wednesday that he is open to the suggestion if residents are interested in a name change, and will bring up the suggestion at the next town meeting. But because of how PETA handled the situation — by issuing a press release before he or anyone else had a chance to discuss the proposal — Ward said it is unlikely he will respond to the Virginia-based group.\n\nPETA did not respond to calls for comments Tuesday evening.\n\nThe president of PETA, Ingrid E. Newkirk, said in the statement that the name is contrary to the reputation of the family-friendly town.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many people don’t look deeply into the origins of words and names, but that doesn’t diminish the negative connotations — especially for impressionable young minds — of a word like “slaughter,” which conjures up images of dead and dying animals,\" Newkirk said.\n\nPETA even offered to chip in financially for the cost of new signs, the press release said.\n\nPETA Public Outreach Coordinator Hannah Kinder said on Wednesday that the organization sent a media release out before hearing back from the town in an attempt to \"get more attention to the cause and make it more well-known and show the compassionate choice in the situation\" and offer those who support the idea a chance to speak up.\n\nKinder said PETA has sent similar requests to other towns over the years, but to her knowledge, none have taken the organization up on the offer.\n\nIn the town of 233 residents, not everyone was against the idea.\n\nOne resident and rental owner of 17 years, Glenn Stieffenhofer, said he hopes this will spark a healthy conversation on the name.\n\n\"I have mixed opinions, but it's good to know that PETA has initiated the conversation and wants to team up and help pay for it,\" he said.\n\nStieffenhofer said the name has definitely helped increase his rental inquiries.\n\n\"I think more people are interested in the home because of the name,\" he said.\n\nAnother resident, Bill McSpadden, who lives full-time in his grandparents' bayfront cottage, said PETA should have just sent town officials a letter and not issued a press release.\n\n“What are we going to do, start changing everybody’s name?” he asked, noting Broadkill Beach and the Murderkill River. “Does it sound better? Potentially. But I’ve been here all my life and I’m proud to say I’m from Slaughter Beach, and I don’t have a problem with it.”\n\nIn a few months, as they do every spring, nature enthusiasts and birders will descend on the town bordered by the bay and the marsh to watch thousands of shorebirds feast on horseshoe crab eggs.\n\nThis weekend, the town will also celebrate a rather unpopular frequent flyer — greenheads. The first Running from the Greenheads 5k will raise funds for the Delaware Nature Society and the Slaughter Beach Memorial Fire Company.\n\nSoon the town also will celebrate a new boardwalk on the marsh, which will feature interactive displays and lead to a recently installed osprey nest platform.\n\nMORE ON DELAWARE NAMES\n\nDelaware Backstory: The Murderkill River doesn't have a grisly past\n\nThe backstory on odd Delaware place names\n\nContact Josephine Peterson at (302) 324-2856 or jhpeterson@delawareonline.com.

Some locals say the name comes from Delaware's Quaker heritage, specifically Centre Friends – a meetinghouse built centrally in 1796 between others in Kennett Square and Brandywine Hundred. Colloquial use changed the spelling to \"Centerville,\" but residents fixed that in 1974, getting New Castle County Council to restore the \"re\" spelling officially. To residents' dismay, Centreville gets mistaken as part of nearby Greenville, named not for lush local foliage but for the Green family, which had a lumber yard at the local train station.\n\nCorner Ketch\n\nCorner Ketch, northwest of Newark, is known for its laid-back living and bucolic setting. But the name is said to have come from a local tavern with a reputation for attracting regular customers who were so tough, strangers were warned: \"They'll ketch ye at the corner.\"\n\nOgletown\n\nLike Talleyville, Ogletown got its name from a once-prominent family. Thomas Ogle, who farmed about 1,500 acres in the area, ultimately became one of the last visible remnants of the one-time rural village – nibbled away for road expansions and dominated by MBNA Bank. His grave sits on one corner of the crossroads, with a granite top that replaced the decayed original marble slab. It reads: \"Here lies the Body of Thomas Ogle who departed this Life the 23rd day of December 1771 Aged 66 years. Glass is run, Work is done / Deed I lie under Ground / Entombed in Clay until the Day / I hear the trumpet sound.\"\n\nGlasgow\n\nGlasgow, a sprawl around U.S. 40 and Del. 896, grew as a community of hospitality for travelers. Known during the American Revolution as Aikentown (for local tavern owner Matthew Aiken), Glasgow was named by Scottish settlers for Glasgow, Scotland. The Glasgow Arms, a once-stately restaurant sometimes called the area's one true namesake landmark, was bulldozed in 1997 to make way for an Arby's. The loss upset locals and continues to fuel ongoing efforts to preserve the area's remaining historic buildings.\n\nChristiana\n\nThe Colonial port village of Christiana is among scores of Delaware places and things named for Swedish Queen Christina, whose father was Gustavus Adolphus, Sweden's great soldier-king. The Swedes and Finns who founded Delaware's first permanent European settlement at modern-day Wilmington in 1638 used the young queen's name freely, but it was later Anglicized to \"Christiana.\" Most of the Anglicized names were returned to \"Christina\" before a royal visit, but the village kept the British version. First named Christiana Bridge, the village hosted George Washington and was the March 1781 landing site of the Marquis de Lafayette and 1,500 troops in what has been called a crucial boost to the Revolutionary cause. Later doomed economically when bypassed by the early railroad, the village is less well known than the nearby mall that took its name.\n\nBarratt's Chapel\n\nMany Delaware communities were named for early churches, but this is the most famous and one of few that kept \"chapel\" or \"church\" in its name. Philip Barratt built the church in 1780, and it was there that believers decided in 1784 to organize the Methodist Episcopal Church. Hence it's called \"The Birthplace of Modern Methodism\" and \"The Cradle of Methodism in America.\" Believers opposed slavery (while this was a slave state) and welcomed blacks. Some became leaders in the development of free assembly and worship by African-Americans, forming some of the nation's most historic black churches.\n\nTalleyville\n\nTalleyville is one the state's many unincorporated communities named for a prominent local family. In the northern region of crops and dairies, the Talleys were a farm family that scorned pretense: They upheld a tradition of Saturday fox hunting, but without formality, following home-raised hounds on home-raised horses that also did farm chores.\n\nBrandywine Hundred\n\nThis region north of Wilmington touches on two of Delaware's best name legends, the Brandywine and the \"hundred.\" Historians say the hundred is mistakenly said to have indicated areas from which residents had to muster 100 militiamen, while the name merely was an administrative or political term from Colonial times, similar to Pennsylvania's townships. Brandywine Hundred is the most commonly used name among the state's old hundreds. However, the source of the picturesque creek's name has been lost to time, but some folks say the name came from early descriptions of the color of the creek's water as resembling a drink popular among early Dutch settlers, a mixture of wine and brandy called \"brandywine.\"\n\nClaymont\n\nClaymont is known as a blue-collar area from its days as a steel town, now in a renaissance and proud of its odd tradition, the Christmas Weed. The settlement was first called Naaman's Creek or Naamans, for a Lenape chief who befriended early Swedes. The community grew around Philadelphia Pike, where the landmark Claymont Stone School sits near the home of famous American illustrator Felix O.C. Darley. A recent history says the area got its name in the early 1850s from the wife of the Rev. Clemson, pastor of the Church of the Ascension, who called the area around the rectory Claymont after her family home, Claymont Court, in Charlestown, W.Va. Others say it was named for the Clayton family or for the clay content of the local soil.\n\nHares Corner\n\nNo mega-rabbits here, just like no bears in Bear. Hares Corner on U.S. 13, the state's main north-south route, and east-west U.S. 40, was a prime location for its former stage stop, cattle market and a tavern run by area farmer John Haire in the 1800s. Longtime residents recall the Green Tree Inn, razed in the 1930s for the dual highway, but the New Castle County Airport and New Castle Farmers' Market still echo the former farmland's prominent role in transportation and commerce.\n\nBear\n\nBear's suburban sprawl, which consumed all but one working farm around Del. 7 and U.S. 40 from near New Castle to Glasgow, got its name from a Colonial tavern. The Bear – exact location unknown – bore a picture-sign well understood by the largely illiterate but thirsty locals. The Bear, which also attracted prominent travelers such as George Washington, closed in 1845 and was razed for the area's first railroad. But its name stuck for a rail station, followed by a post office, and it now is best-known for the state's busiest library, whose circular, cone-roofed building was designed to resemble a carousel.\n\nRed Lion\n\nWelcome to another area that got its name from a popular 18th century tavern – not that Delawareans are booze hounds, but colonists are said to have consumed about two gallons of brew as a daily dietary staple. Red Lion sits near Kirkwood, a similar hamlet named in honor of local Revolutionary War hero Robert Kirkwood, who chose the Hale-Byrnes House near Stanton for George Washington's council of war after the Battle of Cooch's Bridge, the war's only battle fought on Delaware soil. Also nearby: Wrangle Hill around Del. 72 and U.S. 13, named for a long-standing feud between two of the early families who settled here, perhaps too close to each other.\n\nKitts Hummock\n\nThis small community for generations served as a low-key resort area. In the 1960s, its year-round population of about two dozen quadrupled in summer. The name comes from Kitts Hummock, a sandy hill where the community grew. But the hill's name is said to have a pirate's ancestry: Reportedly, it first was named \"Kidd's Hammock,\" for 17th-century pirate Captain William Kidd. Many of Delaware's place names come from its early shipping heritage – lighthouses and landmarks for seafarers, noted captains, ships and inns. Others are named for pirates, shipwrecks and treasures washed ashore.\n\nLittle Heaven\n\nLittle Heaven, which locals say is struggling since Del. 1 opened, was a name applied originally to a group of cabins a local farmer built in the 1870s for Irish workers in his orchards. A nearby community called Little Hell has vanished. Little Heaven is a frequent Delaware entry in lists of odd American place names. Others are Blue Ball, named for a Colonial tavern just north of Wilmington; Cocked Hat, northwest of Bridgeville in Sussex County; and Hourglass, named for the distinctive shape of this tract of land west of Camden in Kent County.\n\nCool Spring\n\nHere's a place name with a double derivation: Like Barratt's Chapel, Cool Spring, seven miles southwest of Lewes and eight miles east of Georgetown, was named for a house of worship. In turn, Cool Spring Presbyterian Church had gotten its inspirational and descriptive name from a convenient local water feature; springs that often attracted early American tourists. Such springs also inspired Wilmington's Cool Spring neighborhood and Brandywine Springs Park on Newport Gap Pike in New Castle County. In fact, Delaware newcomers often are surprised by how common springs are, sometimes gurgling up persistently through sidewalks, roads and basement floors.\n\nLong Neck\n\nOne first-time visitor to southern Delaware remarked on the many names that include \"neck,\" asking if natives here have some innate propensity for passion. But Long Neck and other Delaware necks draw their names from their geography: a neck is a narrow strip of dry land, peninsula-like, that generally is bordered on three sides by wet or periodically wet lowlands, marsh or swamp. Those geographic features also make a good showing in Delaware place names, along with ponds, rivers, creeks, tributaries and branches – like the widespread word ending \"kill,\" from the Dutch word for creek.\n\nPot Nets\n\nPot Nets is an area with a namesake point, cove, community and residential resort complex along the northwest shore of Indian River Bay. This is a Delaware place name that proves it pays to know the local lingo: Lingo is a prominent family name in these parts and Pot Nets Point also is known as Lingo Point and Lingos Point. The Pot-Nets Communities (with a hyphen) are a group of six scenic residential and recreational waterfront communities. The name comes from one of the region's most succulent delicacies, which helped establish the area as a resort. Put another way for the uninitiated, potnets are what you want to put out to get you some crabs.\n\nSources: \"History of Delaware,\" by J.

(In 2014, then Delaware Heritage Commission Chair Dick Carter told The News Journal the name comes from the Dutch word “moeder,” which means mother, and “kill,” which means river.)\n\nOfficials said Rhodamine WT is commonly used in water quality tests and it will not harm humans or the environment.\n\nNo one is sure how brightly red the river will turn, or whether the dye will be noticeable as the water reaches the Delaware Bay. It also is unclear how long the dye will linger, but it is not expected to last days or weeks, said DNREC environmental scientist Michael Bott.\n\n“That’s the whole goal of the study,” said Bott, who manages Delaware’s shellfish program. “Depending on the dilution, you may be able to visibly see that at Bowers, but maybe not. It could be blood red or not that visible.”\n\nWhy they're testing\n\nThe Murderkill River winds through southeastern Kent County, dividing Bowers Beach and South Bowers as it meets the Delaware Bay. Several oyster beds in the bay are used for commercial harvesting that potentially could be vulnerable in the face of a large spill.\n\nThe wastewater treatment plant near Frederica in Kent County is the second largest in the state. It processes an average 14 million gallons per day, which is treated and then discharged into a manmade waterway on its way to the river.\n\nThe plant treats waste from residents, businesses and industrial customers throughout Smyrna, Clayton, Dover, Camden-Wyoming, Harrington, Milford and other unincorporated areas of the county.\n\nBott said wastewater spills are rare, but they have occurred in the past.\n\nPrevious waste spills\n\nLast year, DNREC fined Kent County a total of $36,130 in penalties and other costs for a spill. It said the county had released nearly 1 million gallons of untreated sewage into the nearby St. Jones River over multiple occasions between July 2016 and February 2017.\n\nDNREC officials said one of those incidents, which led to about 700,000 gallons reaching the river, was the worst spill in the state since June 2013. That was when another of Kent County's pump stations discharged 1.3 million gallons into Cypress Branch, which feeds the St. Jones.\n\nIn summer 2017, state environmental officials temporarily closed shellfish harvesting in the Delaware Bay after Kent County wastewater discharges led to potentially harmful pollution reaching the bay from the Murderkill River, according to previous reporting by The News Journal.\n\nNear the mouth of the Murderkill River, which is just south of the St. Jones River, there already is a 3.5-mile area where shellfish harvesting is prohibited, Bott said.\n\nTracking the dye\n\nThe red-dye study will look at whether areas outside of that zone could be vulnerable after a spill by gathering information about where the water moves and how quickly effluent is diluted, he said.\n\nPermanent sensors installed in the waterway this week will be able to detect the dye, even if it’s not visible. Three teams of people in boats will also track the dye by towing sensors in the water behind them, he said.\n\nIt is unclear when study results will be publicly available. Bott said the federal government is providing the equipment and analysis for the study while the state and county are contributing logistics support and vessels.\n\nHave you noticed something new or unique along the Delaware Bay or ocean beaches?

A local resident watched the seal haul out, amble up an access road and then venture across Del. 15 at Carpenters Bridge. She slipped back into the water at Coursey Pond. The pond dam and spillway would have blocked a more direct route.\n\nIf she keeps going, she could end up near Killens Pond at Felton. The headwaters of the Murderkill are 21 miles from Delaware Bay.\n\nConsidering that she traveled south from New England, \"it's not that far for a seal,\" said Suzanne Thurman, executive director of the Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute, based in Lewes. \"What's 12 miles or so up a creek?\"\n\nThurman said in the past, there have been other seal sightings on tributaries of the Delaware Bay, including the Mispillion, at Little Creek and Leipsic and along the St. Jones just southeast of Dover.\n\nThe thing that makes this sighting so interesting is that the seal has shown up in a populated area where people can see it, she said.\n\nMERR volunteers have been at the creek leading up to the pond for a couple of weeks just to make sure that people understand that seals, while cute from a distance, are wild animals and can be dangerous.\n\nJim Cox, of Milford, said he was fishing just east of the spillway just after Christmas.\n\n\"A wave came up,\" he said. \"Where did that come from?\" he recalled asking himself. \"Then she came up and laid on the cement.\"\n\nThurman said the seal is an adult female and she weighs between 150 and 200 pounds. She appears healthy, Thurman said.\n\nThat means that at this point, MERR staff and volunteers are simply keeping an eye on her. Any rescue effort would stress the seal, she said.\n\nJason Davis, an environmental scientist with the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, said the seal is likely finding plenty to eat.\n\nTypically, he said, they favor fish that are small enough to swallow whole. The bass and bluegills in the pond and creek would be the perfect size, he said.\n\nIn the Atlantic, harbor seals are found from the eastern Canadian Arctic and Greenland south to southern New England and New York. Sometimes they migrate as far south as the Outer Banks of North Carolina.\n\nFederal fisheries scientists estimate the population at just under 76,000 in the region.\n\nSeal sightings used to be rare along the Delaware coast. They were among seal species that were hunted for the fur trade. Since the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, the northern population has rebounded, and harbor seals have moved farther south in the winter to find food.\n\nTypically, Thurman said, February is the big month for seal reports in Delaware waters. The animals start showing up around Thanksgiving and are regularly spotted on the breakwaters off Lewes and at Indian River Inlet, she said. The rock jetties give the animals a place to haul out and rest, she said. Some seals haul out on the beaches, too, she said.\n\nSTORY: Four years, zero emails written by Wilmington mayor\n\nSTORY: Former Sen.

They shouldn't approach a seal as the animals can become aggressive and can bite.\n\nIn the case of the Coursey Pond seal, people should watch from a distance.\n\nMeanwhile, Thurman said, there haven't been any sightings of the seal in recent days so if area residents to see her, Thurman would like to hear about it.\n\nThat the seal crossed the road to get to the pond side is both amazing and a bit of a concern because of the high-speed traffic on the two-lane road, she said.\n\n\"She may be in the big pond, or she could have crossed back over,\" she said. \"The members of the community have taken on this caregiver's role.\"\n\nWith ample food and enough space away from people, Thurman said, \"there is absolutely no reason for her to want to leave.\"\n\nContact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

The four-day celebration, called Pran Pratistha (dignity of life), kicked off Thursday and continued through the weekend as hundreds attended from all over the world. Because it is rare for a new temple to be opened, very few Hindu people get the opportunity to attend Pran Pratistha. Sunday’s festivities brought together more than 200 people as nine priests finalized the grand opening and “gave life” to the eight main idols inside the temple. The site will serve the Hindu community throughout central and south Alabama. Manoj Mishra, president of the Hindu Society of Alabama, says the community welcomes anyone who wants to tour the space and learn about the voluminous traditions present in Hinduism.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The fight over the dividend Alaskans receive from the state’s oil-wealth fund could hamper efforts to finalize a state infrastructure budget as the end of the special session looms. Major provisions in the capital budget draft that advanced from the House Finance Committee on Tuesday would require support from three-quarters of the House – or at least 30 of the House’s 40 members. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt said he cannot see any of his 15 Republican members lending their support without funding for an Alaska Permanent Fund dividend settled. Lawmakers have been unable to come to agreement on the size of dividend that should be paid this year. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon said the expectation is for a future special session on the dividend. The current special session expires Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A ski resort wants to expand services with night skiing and tubing, new chairlifts and mountain biking trails, and a zip line. The Arizona Snowbowl operates on roughly a square mile of the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona. Snowbowl general manager J.R. Murray says the resort will submit a master plan to the U.S. Forest Service this fall. The plan will be subject to environmental review and public comment. Murray says implementing the plan could boost visitation from 3,870 to 4,500 people daily. The resort says the earliest that the new services could start is 2021. Native Americans have challenged the Snowbowl for decades over its existence on a mountain they consider sacred. More recently, they lost a lengthy legal battle to prevent snowmaking at the resort.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The voting system for electing judges to the state’s top courts violates black residents’ rights by diluting the strength of their votes, according to a federal lawsuit filed by civil rights lawyers. The lawsuit filed Monday says that because the state’s seven Supreme Court justices are elected statewide, instead of by district, the white voting bloc overpowers the votes of black Arkansas residents. The suit says that’s why no black judge has ever been elected to the court. The lawsuit points to several cases in which a black candidate was supported by a majority of black voters in an election but was defeated by a white candidate supported by a majority of white voters. Instead, lawyers suggest the state should change the voting system for Supreme Court justices by creating electoral districts, for which black voters “in at least one district would constitute a majority of the voting-age population.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A $2 billion transit terminal that was shut down six weeks after opening last year will reopen July 1. The Transbay Joint Powers Authority said Tuesday that it has fixed the cracks that led to the San Francisco terminal’s abrupt closure in September. The authority, which operates the Salesforce Transit Center, also said it conducted a thorough review. The terminal will provide local bus service in early July, with regional transportation starting in late summer. The new center replaced the grim and seismically deficient Transbay Terminal nearby. It is meant to be a modern transportation hub with food trucks, pop-up retail shops and a rooftop park. The center is more than 1 million square feet and stretches four blocks, with four stories above ground and two stories below.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A 100-mile ultrarun through the state’s southwestern mountains has been canceled because of this year’s heavy snowfall and avalanche debris. In an announcement this week, Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run director Dale Garland said that conditions on much of the San Juan Mountains course are uncertain. While snow looked to be dropping to manageable levels in time for July’s race, Garland said that unprecedented avalanche debris and high levels in waterways helped lead to the decision to cancel what would have been the 26th run. The race was also called off in 2002 because of wildfires and in 1995 because of heavy late-season snow. Runners from around the world participate in the race over 13 mountain passes. They run through the night and finish in an average of about 41 hours.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The Connecticut Repertory Theatre at UConn has teamed up with the school’s interpreting services to make its plays more accessible to the deaf community. UConn Interpreting Services will provide interpreters this summer for performances of the musicals “Mamma Mia!” and “Cabaret.” The two interpreters will stand just off stage right signing the dialogue and lyrics to a section of the audience where those with hearing loss will be sitting, while also trying to convey the emotions in the words and music. UConn recently approved American Sign Language studies as a major, beginning in 2020, which will include a concentration in interpreting. Audrey Silva, the director of UConn Interpreting Services, says the school hopes to eventually offer internships with her office.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Parts of the Murderkill River turned shades of red Wednesday as scientists studied how a wastewater spill upstream might affect shellfish in the Delaware Bay. Starting around midnight Tuesday, experts with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Food and Drug Administration began dyeing the effluent processed at the Kent County Wastewater Treatment Plant a crimson color to track its path. The study, using a red dye called Rhodamine WT, will provide the data needed to make decisions in the case of a wastewater spill from the plant along the Murderkill. Officials said Rhodamine WT is commonly used in water quality tests and will not harm humans or the environment. No one is sure how brightly red the river will turn or whether the dye will be noticeable as the water reaches the Delaware Bay, which officials say is the point of the effort.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Independence Day is just over three weeks away, and nobody in town seems to know exactly what the July 4 celebrations in the nation’s capital will look like. President Donald Trump has said he wants to reshape the annual event into a “Salute to America” that would feature Trump himself speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. As the date approaches, the actual plan remains a mystery. Nobody outside the White House or the National Park Service seems to have a firm grasp of the plan, and neither of those entities is talking. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s representative in Congress, says the lack of advance planning is striking. And she says the introduction of Trump and his personal security concerns into the mix could sow chaos.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: A California real estate agent and self-proclaimed “super fan” says he’s extended an offer to buy the Florida home of rock legend Tom Petty. Kevin Beauchamp tells The Gainesville Sun he quickly made an offer of $175,000 for the nearly 1,200-square-foot home after seeing the home’s current owner, Brandy Clark, mention on a Petty Facebook fan club that she might sell it. He says he has a contract for the home. Petty grew up in Gainesville. He died of an accidental overdose in October 2017 at age 66. Beauchamp says he is working with Petty fan Joanne Davis and Jeff Goldstein, president of the Gainesville Music History Foundation, to have the property labeled a historic landmark. Clark says the home still has the original pink tile in the bathroom.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFairburn: Marvel fans can now live out a fantasy in the Peach State if they’re willing to shell out almost $1,000 a night. WSB-TV reports the cabin where Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man, lived during the “Avengers: Endgame” film was listed for rent on Airbnb. The three-bedroom cabin is located on a lake in Fairburn, about 30 minutes southwest of Atlanta. It’s listed at about $800 per night. Marvel has not confirmed whether the property listed is the same as the one where Robert Downey Jr.’s character stayed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has experienced record-high temperatures since the start of June. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports temperatures reached above 90 degrees Fahrenheit seven times between June 4 and June 9. Officials say the temperatures have either tied or surpassed previous records in Honolulu on Oahu and Kahului on Maui. A National Weather Service forecaster says the temperatures are likely due to higher-than-normal water temperatures combined with lighter trade winds. Honolulu was up to 90 degrees Saturday, tying a 1997 record, and 92 degrees Monday. Officials report a streak of high temperatures for Kahului, which on May 22 reached 96 degrees, a record for that month. Officials say temperatures in Kahului reached 95 degrees twice in the days afterward.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Workers at a county jail are notifying federal immigration officials when they are holding foreign-born inmates, including those who are United States citizens. The Idaho Press reports that emails obtained for the month of March through a public records request provided details of how Canyon County jail employees contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials about inmates. Jail workers are instructed to notify immigration officials for “all foreign born inmates,” and inmates are held longer than they normally would be at the request of federal immigration enforcement officials, the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office said. “Have just booked in a foreign born,” said one email from a county worker to immigration officials. “(S)tates she is a citizen, she is currently being held on a zero bond until court Monday.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: The National Weather Service and an outdoor advertising company are teaming up to equip nine digital billboards in central Illinois with the ability to display tornado warnings. Adams Outdoor Advertising says the billboards in Champaign will alert drivers to any tornado warning in effect within 20 miles of each billboard. General manager Reid Reker says the company is providing the warnings as a donation to the community in the interest of public safety. When an alert is activated, each billboard will show only the tornado warning until it has been lifted. John Dwyer of the Champaign County Emergency Management Agency is cautioning people still will need weather radios and phone apps to stay alert to the kind of weather that can rapidly develop into tornadoes even before warnings are issued.\n\nIndiana\n\nRockport: The former drummer of the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch has a new gig as a police officer. Jeremy Spencer was sworn in Sunday with the Rockport Police Department. He grew up near that Ohio River community in the city of Boonville, which he left at 19. Spencer joined Five Finger Death Punch in 2005. He was the band’s drummer until late 2018. He tells WFIE-TV he’s always admired police officers’ work, saying, “You just see the impact they have on everyone’s life. It’s so important.” Spencer’s police duties are part-time. He’s splitting his time between Rockport and Las Vegas. He says he hasn’t retired from the music business. Loudwire, an online magazine that covers hard rock and heavy metal music, voted him “Best Drummer of 2015.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has lowered its estimate of this year’s corn crop to the lowest in four years, saying wet weather has delayed planting and reduced acres planted and the expected per-acre yield. The expected production was cut in a monthly report released Tuesday by 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion bushels, the lowest since 2015. While weather problems also have slowed soybean planting, the USDA didn’t change estimates because farmers have several more weeks to plant. The USDA will release a report June 28 to provide updated farmer surveys more accurately reflecting the number of acres farmers planted. The USDA report also says disputes with China and other nations have reduced corn exports for the current-year crop by 100 million bushels and soybean exports by 75 million bushels.\n\nKansas\n\nWest Mineral: A historic coal mining shovel that was hidden under bramble for more than 70 years has gone on display in southeast Kansas alongside its more well-known successor, an 11 million-pound orange giant known as Big Brutus. The Joplin Globe reports a ceremony to dedicate the Markley shovel is slated for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Big Brutus Visitors Center, a nonprofit museum in West Mineral. Coal mine operator Perry Markley designed and built the shovel in the early 1900s using junkyard parts. The machine was one of the first mining shovels to be equipped with a round dipper stick that allowed the bucket to swivel. It later was used as a prototype to construct other machines like Big Brutus.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Sometimes you have to wait over a century for a good bottle of bourbon. Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company announced Tuesday that it will be releasing its first bourbon in 102 years to the public June22. The bourbon will be released in limited quantities. Started in 1889 by current CEO Corky Taylor’s great-grandfather, Henry Karver, the Peerless brand was once the state’s second-largest bourbon distillery, producing about 200 barrels of rye whiskey and bourbon per day until 1917, when Karver closed the facility at the onset of World War I. The Taylor family resurrected the brand in 2015 with the opening of a new distiller in downtown Louisville. According to a press release, the company used “sweet mash instead of sour, non-chilled filtration, barreling product at 107 proof and bottling it as barrel strength whiskey.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nMooringsport: Sheriff’s deputies say an alligator took a bite out of one of their patrol cars. WBRZ-TV reports deputies were called Monday to Louisiana Highway 1 in Caddo Parish after someone spotted the gator in the middle of the road. The sheriff’s office says deputies were waiting for wildlife removal experts to arrive when the alligator chomped off a piece of the front bumper. Deputies estimate the alligator was 8 feet long. A photo from the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office Facebook page shows the reptile in grass next to what appears to be the black rectangular grill of the car. Authorities say the gator escaped before the wildlife removal experts arrived.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: A California woman who was trying to document her first-ever lobster roll literally got a bird’s eye view of the sandwich. Alicia Jessop wanted to snap the perfect picture Friday of her lobster roll from Fox’s Lobster House in York before she took a bite. She says she was focused on framing the sandwich with the Nubble Lighthouse in the background when she felt something rustle her hand. She quickly realized a seagull had knocked the sandwich out of her hand and was already eating it. As she was walking back to the stand to buy another $21.50 lobster roll, she realized she snapped a photo of the exact moment the seagull snatched her food. She posted the picture on Twitter, saying, “This is why we can’t have nice things.” Jessop says the experience and response to her mishap has taught her that “people just need a laugh.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s health department says fatal drug overdoses are down for the first three months of the year, compared to the same time last year. In preliminary data released Tuesday, the department says there were 577 total unintentional intoxication deaths. That’s a 15% decrease compared to the first three months of last year. Of the total, 89% were opioid-related deaths, primarily attributable to fentanyl. Steve Schuh, director of the state’s Opioid Operational Command Center, says 16 of 24 local jurisdictions saw declines in the number of opioid-related fatalities in the first quarter of this year. He says the state has never seen that many counties report declines in opioid-related deaths. Still, Schuh says the heroin and opioid crisis in Maryland is by no means over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nYarmouth: A Massachusetts man who struck a friendship with Anne Frank’s father has donated a trove of letters and mementos he received from Otto Frank to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum ahead of the 90th anniversary of the young Holocaust victim’s birth. Museum historian Edna Friedberg says the pen pal letters exchanged between Ryan Cooper and Otto Frank from 1972 until Frank’s death in 1980 show how Frank worked tirelessly to spread his late daughter’s legacy. Otto Frank was the only person in his family to survive the Holocaust. He had his daughter’s now-famous diary published after the war. The Washington museum says the letters will be made available online and the artifacts possibly displayed later. They include Otto Frank’s coin purse and a family photo of Anne.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michiganders have a superhuman love for ice cream. The state’s favorite flavor of the sweet summer treat is Superman, according to a WorkWise poll published in May. Superman ice cream is a swirl of red, blue and yellow, the colors on the famous superhero’s suit. The flavors of each color vary. The study is based on which ice cream flavors each state searched on Google most often. Michigan is the only state that prefers Superman ice cream over all others, according to the poll. Cookies and cream is the top-searched ice cream in the county, followed by vanilla and then chocolate. Chocolate is more popular than vanilla ice cream in Michigan, the poll shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: The state saw the second-lowest number of fire deaths on record last year, though careless smoking and the lack of working alarms continue to take lives. Thirty-seven people died in fires in Minnesota in 2018, according to the Department of Public Safety State Fire Marshal Division, which released 2018 fire death statistics Tuesday. Last year saw the lowest number of fire deaths since 2009, when 35 people were killed. It’s also a vast improvement since the mid-1970s, when the number of deaths in the state soared to more than 130 each year. The leading cause of fires last year, where a cause could be determined, was careless smoking. Other common causes were cooking and portable heaters. State Fire Marshal Bruce West also notes that this time of year, people should respect their grill and recreational burning materials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: A California rocket company says it will build and test rockets at a NASA facility here. Los Angeles-based Relativity announced Tuesday that it would invest $59 million, with a plan to increase to 200 workers from 90 current employees. The company will lease space from NASA at Stennis Space Center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The facility has long hosted rocket tests. State and local governments are likely to give Relativity more than $4.7 million in aid and tax breaks over the next 10 years as part of the deal. Relativity plans to build rockets through three-dimensional metal printing, completing development by next year. Relativity hopes for an orbital test launch in 2020 and to begin commercial service in 2021.\n\nMissouri\n\nOzark: Bristly cave crayfish are so rare they’ve only been found in caves in nine counties in Missouri and Arkansas. At Smallin Civil War Cave in Ozark, a tour group recently got to see some of the clawed critters, though one of them clearly had a chunk taken out of its back. It’s a creature rare enough that the cave owner decided to rescue it. “I captured it and stuck it in a tub,” said Kevin Bright, co-owner of Smallin Cave. “It had a bite mark on its side, most likely from a raccoon that probably got it. Maybe it got one of its pincer claws on the raccoon’s nose and got away.” The wounded crayfish managed to survive and appears well on its way to eventually shedding its exoskeleton and becoming whole again. The crayfish was released this week into the chilly creek inside Smallin Cave.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new task force is beginning its work to identify jurisdictional barriers that limit cooperation among local, state, federal and tribal agencies in reporting and searching for missing Native Americans. The Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force also will award a grant to a tribal college to create a database of missing Native Americans. Hollie Mackey, a Northern Cheyenne who is an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma, led the discussion during Tuesday’s meeting in Helena, saying such a coordinated effort is a new undertaking. The task force will study the disproportionate rate at which Native American women and children go missing and ways various law enforcement agencies can work together to find them. The group will report back to lawmakers in September 2020 with policy suggestions.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Game and Parks Commission officials are urging the public to leave baby wild animals alone even if they appear to be abandoned. Commission officials say lone fawns, birds or mammals may appear to be abandoned or injured, but in many cases the mother is off feeding or drinking and will return. In some cases, other deer will adopt an orphaned fawn. They say it’s also normal for a doe to leave its fawn to keep it from being detected by predators. Predators can see the doe as it feeds, so she often hides the fawn and leaves the area to draw attention away. Additionally, they say wild animals shouldn’t be treated as pets.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The coming of the machines is inevitable. And this city knows it. MGM Resorts International this year plans to install at Sin City resorts an unknown number of automated beverage systems programmed to mix hundreds of different drinks – all at the touch of a button. It’s a job that for many years depended on the hands of living, breathing service workers. But as the incoming technology moves closer to Nevada casinos, rank-and-file union workers can’t say for certain whether machines will force them to abandon jobs they’ve held for years to develop new skills far from the threat of automation. In the offices of MGM, leaders have been reluctant to reveal how many of these systems are coming or how many workers might be displaced. “We are focused on supporting employees,” Brian Ahern, MGM’s director of corporate media relations, said in a statement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: More than 1,000 graduating high school seniors have participated in alcohol-awareness training on the dangers of underage drinking and impaired driving. Students on Wednesday participated in a virtual impaired driving simulator, programmed for delayed reaction times as the driver navigates different driving conditions, distractions and getting pulled over by an officer. They wore goggles that simulated different blood-concentration levels, allowing students to experience the dangers and consequences of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. They also toured a law enforcement mobile command unit with a drug recognition expert exam area and booking stations. The event was held by the New Hampshire Liquor Commission’s Division of Enforcement and Licensing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLong Branch: Most surfers know it’s best to avoid surfing near pipes that dump storm water into the ocean soon after a storm because of the increased chance of getting sick from bacteria that enter the surf. Many do it anyway because the periods just after storms often bring bigger waves, prompting them to hold their nose and brave the “chocolate tube” or “root beer float.” A study of the relationship between heavy rain, outfall pipes and water-borne bacteria is underway at New Jersey’s Monmouth University, where researchers are evaluating water quality at popular surfing beaches along the Jersey shore with an eye toward documenting higher levels of harmful bacteria in the water after storms. The idea is to give surfers and others who use the water more information to make more informed decisions about when to surf and what might be in the water around them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: This city known for its proximity to arguably the most famous UFO event in the United States now has trademark protection for its alien-inspired logo. The city of Roswell said Tuesday that it received its requested trademark certification from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office. The new bright green logo includes the silhouette of a flying saucer within the letter “R.” The trademark will be in effect for 10 years and can be renewed when it nears expiration. Officials say the logo is protected from unauthorized use by other entities or individuals. That will ensure it remains unique to Roswell, providing an identifiable graphic that people will associate with the city. The site of a supposed UFO crash in 1947, Roswell has an annual extraterrestrial festival that draws thousands.\n\nNew York\n\nWatkins Glen: The host of the Woodstock 50 festival pulled out Monday, but organizers say they’re in talks with another venue. The festival has faced a series of setbacks, the latest when Watkins Glen International announced it won’t be the site of the anniversary event in August. Watkins Glen issued a two-sentence statement saying it had terminated the license for the upstate New York festival “pursuant to provisions of the contract.” But later in the day, a principal organizer indicated the show would go on. “We are in discussions with another venue to host Woodstock 50 on Aug. 16-18 and look forward to sharing the new location when tickets go on sale in the coming weeks,” said Gregory Peck, a managing member of organizers of Woodstock 50 LLC.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBoiling Springs Lake: Homeowners in Brunswick County are upset that the value of their property is slated to increase even though their homes no longer have a waterfront view, thanks to Hurricane Florence. WWAY-TV reports the value of homes in Boiling Spring Lakes is expected to increase. County officials say base property rates have increased 10%. Arvil Stephens’ home sits on a peninsula along Patricia Lake, which was drained after Florence’s floodwaters caused dams to breach last year. The county says the home is valued at $501,000 now, compared to $423,000 a few years ago when the lake was full. The county tax office says the appraisals were conducted with the understanding that the lakes would be restored.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two companies are proposing a $1.6 billion pipeline to move North Dakota crude oil, making it the biggest such project to move oil out of the state since the Dakota Access pipeline that sparked violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement in 2016 and 2017. Houston-based Phillips 66 and Casper, Wyoming-based Bridger Pipeline announced the joint venture called Liberty Pipeline on Monday. It’s designed to move 350,000 barrels of oil daily to the nation’s biggest storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. The exact route of the 24-inch pipeline has not been disclosed, though the companies said the project “will utilize existing pipeline and utility corridors and advanced construction techniques to limit environmental and community impact.” An official also said it wouldn’t cross tribal lands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The State Medical Board has postponed a vote on adding anxiety and autism spectrum disorder to the list of qualifying conditions for purchasing medical marijuana. Board President Dr. Michael Schottenstein said Wednesday the vote would be delayed to give two new board members time to consider expert reports. A physician panel last month recommended that anxiety and autism be added to the list of 21 conditions for which registered physicians can make a patient recommendation for medical marijuana. The board voted against adding opioid use disorder, depression and insomnia as qualifying conditions, which the physician panel did not recommend after hearing from experts. More than 30,000 people with physician recommendations have registered to buy cannabis, with about half making purchases since some licensed dispensaries opened in January.\n\nOklahoma\n\nHulbert: Self-described “straight country boy” Cody Barlow believes duct tape really can fix anything, including bigots. The 28-year-old college student from Hulbert recently decorated the tailgate of his pickup truck like a pride flag with a bold message: “NOT ALL COUNTRY BOYS ARE BIGOTS.” Barlow’s Facebook post about his truck had been shared more than 135,000 times by Tuesday with comments praising him for being an LGBTQ ally. He says he thinks he can change closed minds and encourage loved ones who feel alone. Now, the “jacked-up” 1991 Chevrolet Silverado he uses to off-road through the woods is plastered with rainbow-colored duct tape. “It fixes everything, even bigots,” he said. Barlow plans to drive his truck in pride parades later this month in Oklahoma City and Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state could become the latest in the nation to prohibit single-use plastic shopping bags. The Senate voted 17-12 to prohibit grocery stores and restaurants from providing plastic checkout bags. Stores will still able to offer recyclable plastic and paper bags for a minimum 5-cent fee. The bill now goes to the governor. Plastic bags are one of the most common types of beach litter. The World Economic Forum reports 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean each year. Republicans took issue with the fee, saying it punished consumers. Some also said single-use bags are more sanitary. California was the first state to prohibit plastic bags, with New York state following suit earlier this year. Hawaii bans all types of single-use bags, both paper and plastic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: How do you move a priceless, 25,000-pound sphinx? Very carefully. The largest sphinx in the Western Hemisphere is on the move for the first time in nearly 100 years. The Penn Museum in Philadelphia is relocating its 3,000-year-old sphinx of Pharaoh Ramses II from the Egypt Gallery where it’s resided since 1926. The sphinx’s slow, painstaking journey began Wednesday morning. It’s moving about 250 feet to a featured location in the museum’s new entrance hall. Museum officials are using air dollies to move the statue through a series of doorways, windows, hairpin turns and tight squeezes. Museum director Julian Siggers says the sphinx has been the museum’s unofficial mascot for a long time, and its new location will put it “front and center.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The Navy’s top admiral says an investigation into allegations of mismanagement at the U.S. Naval War College is continuing, and he’s confident the college will be stronger in the end. Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, says the college in Newport will continue to be a strong, vibrant institution. The college president, Rear Adm. Jeffrey Harley, is under investigation for allegedly spending excessively, abusing his hiring authority and otherwise behaving inappropriately, including keeping a margarita machine in his office. Harley was removed from his post Monday. Richardson says he felt there was “enough actionable information” to reassign Harley.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is transitioning to a paper-based voting system that is meant to be more secure than the paperless system that’s raised concerns from some in the past. Under the new system, voters will make their selections on a touchscreen. Paper ballots will be printed off, and voters will then feed the paper ballot into a scanner that counts and records the votes. The paper ballots are saved for auditing and verification, according to the South Carolina Election Commission. The Election Commission says the new system is intended to be more secure and provide a paper trail for votes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A health board that advocates for Native Americans in the Great Plains will soon operate most of Sioux San Hospital. The Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Health Board, on behalf of the Oglala and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, will take over most of the hospital’s management from federal Indian Health Service, according to a news release from the agency. The transfer is scheduled for July 21. The Indian Health Service will continue to provide health care at the hospital, which serves Native Americans, the Rapid City Journal reports. Charmaine White Face opposes the pending transfer. White Face – a Lakota elder, former Oglala Sioux Tribe treasurer and spokeswoman for the Sioux Nation Treaty Council – says she is concerned that not everyone will receive quality health care. “They’re not a health care management system. They are an advocacy organization,” White Face said of the board.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis says it plans to start a culinary institute. A news release says the university’s Board of Trustees approved the Culinary Arts and Foodservice Enterprise at a meeting last week. The university says the culinary school will be an expansion of the Kemmons Wilson School of Hospitality & Resort Management. The institute is expected to be located at the former L’Ecole Culinaire facility in the Memphis suburb of Cordova. The lease requires State Building Commission approval. At the meeting, trustees also approved doctorate programs in applied physics and health sciences, a master’s program in data science, and a bachelor’s degree in public health.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has signed into law a measure that’s meant to allow children to run lemonade stands without fear of being shut down by police. The bill signed by the Republican governor Monday was passed this year after Texas police shut down a lemonade stand run by two girls in 2015. Abbott called the measure “a commonsense law” in a video of him signing the bill posted on Twitter. The new Texas law legalizes temporary lemonade stands or other stands selling nonalcoholic beverages operated by minors on private property or public parks. Lemonade stands were previously illegal in Texas because homemade drinks are banned due to health concerns. The new law takes effect Sept. 1.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The largest DNA mapping study in U.S. history is about to launch from Utah with the stated goal of changing the way health care providers approach diseases. In a press conference Wednesday, officials with Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare announced a “groundbreaking” DNA initiative and project it will undertake with deCODE genetics, a biopharmaceutical company based in Iceland. The five-year study will involve the collection of DNA samples from more than 500,000 participants – most of whom will be Utahns. Individuals will be invited to participate in the study for free, and enrollment is already open. The results of the DNA mapping will be returned to patients if researchers find a gene they know puts their family at risk for cancer or other genetic diseases.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott has signed a bill into law that protects a woman’s access to abortion services. In signing the legislation Monday, Scott said that he has consistently supported a woman’s right to choose and that “the legislation affirms what is already allowable in Vermont – protecting reproductive rights and ensuring those decisions remain between a woman and her health care provider.” The measure is separate from a proposal to amend the state constitution to guarantee a woman’s right to an abortion. Proponents say the two measures are needed in case the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Virginia Tech says it plans to build a new northern Virginia campus that was instrumental in luring a new Amazon headquarters a few blocks north of the originally planned spot. The Innovation Campus at Virginia Tech will now be located at the current location of the Potomac Yard shopping center in Alexandria. School officials say the original location was not going to be big enough to support both the campus and expected ancillary development. The new location puts the campus just steps away from a planned Metrorail station and closer to the Amazon campus in Arlington County that expects to house as many as 38,000 workers over the next 20 years. Virginia Tech said the 15-acre campus will enroll its first students in 2020.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Tech companies, hospitals and others have pledged nearly $49 million to help construct eight buildings to house the area’s chronically homeless. The Seattle Times reports Swedish Health Services, Premera Blue Cross and Providence St. Joseph Health announced $15 million in donations last month to support a Seattle nonprofit developer. Plymouth Housing has launched a $75 million campaign to double its units in Seattle. It operates facilities for chronically homeless people where they have access to health care, social services and treatment. Amazon and Microsoft have each pledged $5 million for the campaign. Plymouth says the donations will help it leverage up to $250 million in public funds for the project.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A principal accused of plagiarizing Ashton Kutcher in an address to his school’s graduating class has been suspended without pay for five days. The News and Sentinel reports Parkersburg High School Principal Kenny DeMoss was suspended Tuesday at a Wood County Board of Education meeting. DeMoss apologized for heavily basing his May address on Kutcher’s 2013 Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards speech. He has said he should’ve cited his sources, but the ideas were his own. A Facebook video highlighting the plagiarism spliced the speeches together. DeMoss said the video excluded a disclaimer that multiple sources informed his speech. Kutcher tweeted Saturday that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and cited Oscar Wilde for the quote. He then quipped that “kids and faculty” should cite their sources.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Voters who appear to have moved within the state will have up to two years to update their voter registration, rather than be deactivated within a month. The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Tuesday to make the change. Voters who appear to have moved will still receive a postcard, likely in late August, saying that state records indicate they have moved. In 2018, when the mailings were first sent, about 308,000 voters had their registrations deactivated within a month. Many of them showed up to vote only to be told they had to register again. To avoid that, the commission is giving voters much longer to affirm their registration or reregister at their new address. Voters who may have moved will be flagged at the polling booth, giving them a chance to fix the problem there.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has appointed eight members of a new advisory group that will develop recommendations to improve state policies related to big game migration on lands that are also suitable for mineral development. The Migration Corridor Advisory Group includes representatives from the oil and gas, mining and agriculture sectors, as well as conservation, recreation and sportsmen groups and a county commissioner. The goal is for the group members to collaboratively develop recommendations in the next three months. Its first meeting is later this month in Rock Springs. Wyoming’s major migration corridors are among the longest in North America and are essential to the health of mule deer.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/13"}]}

Hope had suddenly replaced anguish among those assembled.\n\nBut then Hofstra put together a second surge, and Delaware’s chances were vanquished in the Colonial Athletic Association basketball showdown as quickly as they had re-emerged.\n\nBOX SCORE: Hofstra 60, Delaware 66\n\nThe visitors had scored on nine of 10 possessions to start the second half, an impressive onslaught fueled by five 3-pointers.\n\nThey then answered Asamoah’s basket with a 7-point run that sent them on the way to an 80-66 victory, as Hofstra handed Delaware its third loss in its last four home games.\n\n“They put a lot of pressure on you defensively, in transition, and then just with their ability to make tough shots one-on-one,” Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby said. “I don’t know if I wanna go back and watch the tape but I thought we played some pretty good defense at times and it was just better offense than our defense.”\n\nDelaware (16-9 overall, 7-5 CAA) remained in fourth place in the CAA.\n\nThe Blue Hens play their third home game in five days Monday at 7 p.m. when James Madison makes its final CAA visit before the Dukes’ summer move to the Sun Belt Conference. JMU (14-10, 4-8) handled William & Mary 69-55 on Saturday.\n\nCAA STANDINGS: Hens try to stay near top\n\nThird-place Hofstra (17-9, 9-4 CAA), which beat 24th-ranked Arkansas in December, has now won 17 of the last 20 games against Delaware, including eight of nine in Newark plus a previous matchup this season 82-77 on Long Island.\n\n“I feel for our group because we wanted this so bad,” Ingelsby added. “We were ready to compete. It was tough night. We didn’t get it done but we battled to give ourselves a chance.”\n\nHofstra is in its first season under coach Speedy Claxton, who starred at point guard for the Pride from 1996-2000. He sparked Hofstra to a 76-69 win over two-time defending champ Delaware in the 2000 America East title game at Hofstra, before going off to the NBA.\n\nClaxton was 0-6 against the Hens in the Carpenter Center during his playing career, including a couple America East Tournament defeats. The long-time Hofstra assistant is now 1-0 as a head coach thanks to a versatile array of shooters.\n\nSUPER HEN: Family fueled Ram LB Reeder's drive\n\nHofstra, which led 39-35 at halftime, started the second half 9-for-10 from the field and had its largest lead 65-49 with 10:47 to go after Jalen Ray’s 3-pointer. Hofstra later went 5-for-7 to transform a 67-60 lead into 74-60 after Delaware rallied.\n\n“If we’re gonna give ourselves a chance,” Ingelsby said, “we gotta dig in on that end and get more stops than we did.”\n\nSanford School graduate Jyare Davis led Delaware with 16 points, Ryan Allen scored 12 and Anderson and Asamoah added 10 each for the Hens.\n\nDelaware, which came in with a league-best 49.4 field-goal percentage in CAA games, had several cold spells, shot 39.6 percent (21-for-53) and was 8-for-21 on 3-pointers.\n\nDylan Painter had two points and zero rebounds in 9-plus minutes for Delaware in his return after missing three games with an ankle injury.\n\nHENS HANDLE HUSKIES: Delaware thwarts Northeastern comeback\n\nAaron Estrada, the CAA’s leading scorer, had 21 points to lead five Hofstra players in double figures. The guard was MAAC Rookie of the Year at St. Peter’s in 2019-20 before transferring to Oregon, where he appeared in just nine games last year before transferring to Hofstra before this season.\n\nIn the second half, the Pride shot 53.1 percent from the field (17-for-32) and made 6 of 13 treys. Hofstra also dominated Delaware on the boards 43-28.\n\nKvonn Cramer, the 2021 CAA All-Rookie pick out of Mount Pleasant High, made just his second appearance in Hofstra’s last 10 games after being sidelined with a back injury. He had two points and three rebounds in 5½ minutes.\n\n“I felt like we were playing good defense,” Anderson said. “They just made a lot of tough shots, like, over us. As a team, they really had it going that first eight minutes of the second half. There was a point in time where I was just like, ‘Dang, they’re just not missing at all.’ But that’s a really good team and they’re coached really well, so we’ll get ‘em next time.”\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But as soon as coach Andy Lewman stepped in, you could hear the cheers over the song \"Do the John Wall\" playing over the loud speakers.\n\nThose cheers were made louder by the fact that the Eagles had lost in the title game the last two years under Lewman. They had come so close, only to fall short in the finale in front of the home fans.\n\nNot this time. Delta dominated the first half and held off a late Wapahani run to beat the Raiders 42-32 in the snow-delayed Delaware County championship game on Monday evening. It was the Eagles' first title under Lewman, who took over in 2016. Their last came in 2012.\n\n►RELATED:Delta boys reclaim title of Delaware County champion\n\n\"I just feel like we've been blessed with good opportunities,\" Lewman said. \"And to survive what we did last Tuesday, I felt like our girls did a great job of being resilient through this three-game stretch. They just did an awesome job.\n\n\"I can't be more proud of the girls. They've done a great job of coming in and spending the time in the gym during the summer and the season, and now we're starting to reap the benefits and winning some games we haven't been able to in the past.\"\n\nWhen Lewman talks about surviving last Tuesday, he's talking about how close Delta was to being eliminated in the first round. Playing Yorktown, which dominated the Eagles 58-34 in last year's championship, Delta trailed 25-24 with seconds to play.\n\nThen Kassidy Dishman happened.\n\nThe junior buried a deep 3-pointer to the right of the top of the key, giving Delta the win that launched this championship run.\n\n\"It felt good, honestly,\" she said. \"We came in last year and got killed. Being able to beat them on a last-second shot felt good because they're our rival. It's what we wanted to do.\"\n\nThat was just the start of Delta's revenge tour. After cruising past Wes-Del in the semifinals, the Eagles faced a Wapahani squad in the finals that had beat them two years ago for the title and by 15 earlier in this season.\n\nThe difference this time, Lewman said, was defense. Delta fell behind 3-2, but closed the half on a 20-4 run to take a 22-7 lead into the break.\n\n\"I thought we did what we set out to do by setting the tone in the first half,\" Lewman said. \"The second half we had some moments where it wasn't what we hoped for, but we then we did a good job of finishing and taking care of the basketball. I was really proud of them.\"\n\nAnother factor was the presence of senior Brooklyn Matheny, who was dealing with a broken hand the last time these two teams played. She hit some big shots as Wapahani cut Delta's lead to seven in the fourth, and along with Dishman, helped the Eagles kill the clock.\n\nMatheny, Dishman and Miranda Hart all had eight for Delta, while Avery Lewman and Lainey Bonser added six each. It speaks to the balance of this team that no one scored in double figures (Wapahani's Madison Thompson was the only player, with 12) and it was still able to control the game.\n\n\"You just never know what's going to happen,\" Matheny said. \"I mean we all play and get excited for each other.\"\n\nThat type of team effort is something Delta hopes will translate to the postseason in a couple weeks. At this point, the Eagles are as good a bet as any to win what looks to be a wide open Class 3A Sectional 24 field.\n\n\"It's incredible,\" Lewman said. \"You just don't know who is going to step up from one night to the next. That's one of the greatest things about this group of girls: I look at them and have always thought a Delaware County championship was in the cards. I still very strongly feel like we have a shot to be in the middle of everything in the sectional. I'm really excited to keep moving forward with them and keep pushing every day.\"\n\nJake Fox is a high school sports writer at The Star Press.

Palladinetti made the decision on Tuesday based on an incident following the Tigers’ 58-46 loss at the Delaware Military Academy on Feb. 16.\n\nA group of about 20, which included parents of players, at least three Wilmington City Council members, New Castle County District 10 Councilman Jea Street and other supporters assembled in the parking lot outside the school at 10 a.m. Thursday. After speaking with reporters for 35 minutes, the group was invited into a classroom by Red Clay spokesperson Pati Nash.\n\nThe group demanded to speak to Palladinetti, who arrived 20 minutes later and gave his timeline of events and the reasoning behind his decision.\n\nSeveral parents of A.I. du Pont players have alleged that racial slurs were spoken by DMA players, fans and students during the game. But Palladinetti said A.I. boys basketball coach Tom Tabb, Assistant Principal Damon Saunders (both of whom are black) and the other A.I. assistant coaches did not report hearing any racial slurs.\n\nDMA Commandant Anthony Pullella was at the game and said he did not hear any racial comments. Michael Ryan, the athletic director, said DMA officials conducted their own investigation, questioning parents, players, coaches and fans. He said no evidence was uncovered about any racial comment being used.\n\nLOTTERY: $435 million Powerball ticket sold\n\n“There were no, absolutely zero reasons for us to discipline our kids,\" Ryan said, \"or there was absolutely no issues brought up that our kids were in the wrong in any way.\"\n\nRyan said no official footage of the incident exists because a video camera that was recording the game turned off during the fourth quarter.\n\nWhen asked whether a conversation about race should occur to ease tensions between predominantly white DMA and A.I. du Pont, which is 34 percent white, Pullella said, “We don’t think [the incident] had anything to do with race at all.”\n\nPalladinetti said he was in his office at 6:45 p.m. Feb. 16 when a person attending the game at DMA called him. The person said, “Kevin, you’re going to need to be over here. Something is happening with your team,” Palladinetti said.\n\nPalladinetti texted Saunders, who was at the game. Saunders called the principal at about 7:30.\n\n“His response to me was, ‘It’s bad. It’s a bad situation right now,’” Palladinetti said. “And I said, ‘OK.’”\n\nPalladinetti said he spoke with Tabb and Ryan that night, but no decision was made regarding the team’s season at that time.\n\nTabb said his team expected to defeat DMA easily. The Tigers came into the game with an 11-7 record, while DMA was 6-11.\n\n“We were playing a team that we thought we were better than, that we knew we were better than,” Tabb said. “The kids said, 'We should be able to score 100 against them.' So we were a little cocky going into the game.”\n\nBut the Seahawks upset A.I. 58-46. Game officials called the majority of the fouls against the Tigers, as DMA shot 35 free throws and A.I. shot only 10.\n\n“The ball didn’t bounce our way during the game,” Tabb said. “[The players] got frustrated. I could see embarrassment setting in.”\n\nPOLITICS: Delaware Senate control on the line\n\nWith 40 seconds left, an A.I. player was given a technical foul. At that point, Tabb said he told the players on the bench to skip the customary postgame handshake line. Instead, the coach told the team he would shake hands with the DMA team, and the players were to remain behind him and follow him off the court as a group.\n\n“I thought I was doing what was right, in the best interests of the kids at that moment,” Tabb said. “When the game was over, a player started to walk and then sprinted, which caused a chain reaction where the other players followed, the coaches followed, parents followed, some DMA parents followed.”\n\nOfficials from both schools said the A.I. players ran toward a stairwell leading to the second level of the gymnasium, where DMA students and fans had been watching the game.\n\n“The entire team takes off, makes a beeline for our mezzanine,” Pullella said.\n\nPullella said he and two DMA parents blocked the group’s access to the mezzanine. On the stairwell landing, it was “pandemonium,” Pullella said.\n\nMeanwhile, Pullella said another teacher directed DMA students out of the mezzanine through an emergency door. DMA athletic director Ryan took an elevator to the second floor and joined Pullella and the parents. Pullella said the confrontation ended a couple of minutes later when approximately 10 Delaware State Police and New Castle County Police officers arrived.\n\nIn a statement, state police Master Cpl. Jeffrey Hale said police responded at 6:46 p.m.\n\n“It was learned that members of the A.I. du Pont men’s basketball team attempted to run up toward the student body of DMA following the game,” Hale said. “They were prevented from doing so by staff members. The situation was quickly brought under control. No fights. No injuries. No charges. That is all the information I have.”\n\nLater that night, Palladinetti said he decided to forfeit A.I.’s final regular-season game, a home game against Smyrna scheduled for Tuesday. But he held off on making a decision about the team’s state tournament participation. Palladinetti met with Tabb at the school at 7 a.m. Friday.\n\n“When the game ended, and it’s important to know that this is the part that I care about, the entire team vacated the court,” Palladinetti said. “There is a player who many are reporting was the first to lead the charge off the court. And that happened within about three seconds of the buzzer sounding. Mr. Saunders attempted to stop one player from leaving the court. He was able to shimmy past Mr. Saunders, and then the rest of the team just followed suit and bolted into the hallway, then stairwell, to ultimately get upstairs.\n\n“When I heard that both Coach Tabb and Mr. Saunders had a plan in place to try to quell any tensions that were brewing on the court, and for our team to vacate in that manner, without an assistant coach, without anybody walking them off, to run in the manner in which they did, it created alarm; it created panic.”\n\n“… Their actions then sparked a significant event, in my opinion,” Palladinetti added. “I would have thought that a team in the 19th game of the season would have been a little more disciplined, would have respected the coach’s request to stay put. Had they not run off the court in the manner in which they did, we wouldn’t be having this conversation today.”\n\nSchool was not in session on Friday or Monday. Palladinetti met with the team on Tuesday, when he said players were encouraged to complete written statements. He said only one prepared a statement.\n\nAfter meeting with the team, Palladinetti decided to cancel the rest of the season. He acknowledged that statements have been received from players, fans and parents following his decision. Parents cited the A.I. du Pont code of student conduct, which they said requires administrators to hold a conference with students and their parents before taking any disciplinary action.\n\n“To make the decision to cancel senior night and any game without an appropriate investigation … you were supposed to call a conference with the students and the parents,” said Jennifer Field, mother of A.I. player Jude Gulotti. “There were a lot of different angles that were seen. We were all over that place, and a lot of things happened that you don’t know about. I think it was inappropriate to make any decision.”\n\nGerald Wilmore, father of player Jason Wilmore, criticized Tabb for not talking with the team since the incident. Devon Hynson, executive director of Education Voices Inc., a student advocacy organization, said mistakes were made on all sides.\n\n“I just think it’s completely racist,” Hynson said, addressing Tabb and Palladinetti. “Because I think it’s been made very clear that you didn’t follow the [student] code of conduct. We’re all here because we all make mistakes. What we’re saying is, [the players] made a mistake, you guys made a mistake. Reinstate the boys back on the team. At the end of the day, I think that you owe them that.”\n\nTommie Neubauer, executive director of the Delaware Interscholastic Athletic Association, said a committee will meet at 9 a.m. Friday to determine the seedings and pairings for the DIAA Boys Basketball Tournament.\n\nThe tournament is scheduled to begin Wednesday with eight games, all starting at 7 p.m. Neubauer said A.I. du Pont officials need to let DIAA know whether the school will participate or not by 9 a.m. Friday.\n\n“It’s not like we are keeping them out,” Neubauer said. “… Right now, we’re going to seed the full tournament as is. It’s an A.I. du Pont High School/Red Clay School District question right now.”\n\nA.I. du Pont was 8-1 midway through the season, but, counting the forfeit loss to Smyrna, lost eight of its last 11 games to finish the regular season at 11-9. Still, the Tigers are expected to have earned enough points to qualify for the 24-team tournament.\n\nMidway through the contentious, 50-minute classroom meeting with Palladinetti, New Castle County Councilman Street erupted, threatening legal action if the principal’s decision is not overturned.\n\n“If y’all think you’re going to get away with this without a legal battle, you are sadly mistaken,” Street said. “You do what you want to do, and I’m going to tell you what I have to do. Because by any legal means necessary, and I’m asking the City Council members present right now, that we know full well that this was provoked in a racial manner. I’m asking you if this is not overturned, for the city to file an injunction in Chancery Court prohibiting the state from going forward with the tournament until such time as this is resolved in a fair and appropriate manner.”\n\nStreet then left the room to applause, as Wilmington City Council President Hanifa Shabazz and council members Va’Shun Turner and Ernest “Trippi” Congo II signaled their support for his statement.\n\nTabb, who said he told Palladinetti before this incident that he would be stepping down after 10 years as the Tigers’ coach, said he was disappointed that the players didn’t follow his instructions.\n\n“I know I’m the fall guy,” Tabb said. “I get thrown under the bus for this, and I’m cool with that. I’m perfectly fine with that.”\n\nPalladinetti said the decision “has consumed my life” since Feb. 16.\n\n“It pains me to think that a decision I made has brought us to this arena today,” the principal said. “I’ve lost sleep over this, as I know many of you have. It’s not something that has been taken lightly, and it’s not something that has just been dismissed at any point.”\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com, or on Twitter @BradMyersTNJ.

The former All-Stater from Sanford School led Delaware with 17 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nFellow post dweller Andrew Carr supplied 13 points and seven rebounds. Guard Jameer Nelson Jr. had 11 points for the Hens.\n\nThe Blue Hens (20-12) became the school’s ninth 20-win team in school history.\n\n\"We were connected today,\" Nelson said. \"Everybody was talking and helping each other out, and you can't go wrong when you're doing that.\"\n\nThey’ll continue their attempted makeover in Monday’s 6 p.m. semifinals (CBS Sports Network) against top-seeded Towson, a 68-61 victor over No. 9 Northeastern in Sunday’s first quarterfinal.\n\nTowson beat Delaware twice, including the completion of a suspended game Monday that followed the Hens' home losses against Charleston and UNC-Wilmington. Delaware practiced at 7 a.m. Wednesday and again that afternoon as it began its effort to improve for the tournament.\n\n\"I thought we did some tough, gritty stuff when we needed to,\" Delaware coach Martin Ingelsby said of Sunday's win, adding the Wednesday morning session \"set the tone.\"\n\n\"We had to focus on what was in front of us,\" the coach said. \"I had a lot of conversations with these guys one-on-one and as a team on what that meant for us. Really proud of how they responded today. These guys were ready to go.\"\n\nCAA BRACKET: Blue Hens seeded fifth\n\nDelaware has reached the CAA semifinals seven times now, most recently when it lost to Hofstra in both 2019 and 2020. Delaware also made the semifinals in 2002, 2003, 2013 and its 2014 title run.\n\nThe title game is slated for 7 p.m. Tuesday, also on the CBS Sports Network.\n\nDelaware is trying to become the first No. 5 seed to win in the tournament’s 39-year history. Only one No. 5 – William & Mary in 2008 – has reached the title game.\n\nFourth-seeded Drexel (15-14) won the 2021 CAA Tournament as the sixth seed, the lowest-seeded champion since East Carolina prevailed as the No. 7 in 1993.\n\nFormer CAA Player of the Year Camren Wynter scored 28 points for the Dragons, but nobody else was in double figures due to Delaware's defensive success.\n\nIt was the 165th meeting in the CAA’s oldest and most-played rivalry, which Delaware leads 85-80. The two had met three times in their previous 20 seasons in CAA Tournament games, with Delaware winning each – in the 2002 quarterfinals and 2006 and 2008 play-in rounds. Counting three NAC/America East title games, Delaware now owns seven straight tournament wins over Drexel.\n\nThe Blue Hens and Dragons had each prevailed on the other’s home court in their two regular-season meetings. Delaware won 81-77 in Philadelphia on Jan. 11, when Drexel rallied from a 22-point second-half deficit and got within four. Drexel avenged that defeat at the Carpenter Center 76-68 on Feb. 3 in which it shot 53 percent from the field.\n\nMore on Blue Hens\n\nRECIPE FOR SUCCESS: 5 ways Hens can cook up CAA title\n\nHAPPY HOMECOMING: Sanford grad Davis of UD named CAA Rookie of the Year\n\nADDING ON: North Carolina A & T continues CAA expansion\n\nThis time, Drexel shot 38 percent and was just 4-for-23 on 3-pointers.\n\n\"I'm really proud of our group for how we dug in on the defensive end,\" Ingelsby said.\n\nDelaware also outrebounded the Dragons 37-32, and there were often multiple Blue Hens fighting for the same rebound on the defensive end.\n\n\"That comes back to being a tougher basketball team,\" Ingelsby said.\n\nDelaware led 27-16 at halftime, which equaled its largest lead of the opening 20 minutes.\n\nThe Hens quickly extended their lead to 38-23 to start the second half before a 10-0 Dragons run made it 38-33 with 13:27 left.\n\nDelaware rebuilt the lead to 10 again, 43-33 with 11:57 to go, but Drexel whittled away. The Dragons got within three several times, the last on Coletrane Washington’s 3-pointer that made it 51-48 with 5:28 on the clock.\n\nBut Delaware followed with Kevin Anderson’s 3-pointer and a pair of 3-point plays by Davis to go up by 12 with 2:18 left.\n\nAnderson had nine points and five assists, and Ryan Allen had nine points and three assists.\n\nAs 20-game winners, the Hens joined their predecessors from 1991-92 (27-4); 1992-93 (22-8); 1997-98 (20-10); 1998-99 (25-6) 1999-00 (24-8); 2000-01 (20-10); 2013-14 (25-10); and 2019-20 (22-11).\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

As the host Eagles held for the final shot, they were in danger of wasting the final 59 seconds of the first half.\n\nBut Sullivan somehow snuck away and hit a desperation runner at the buzzer to cut Delta’s deficit to one going into the locker room. From there, the Eagles pulled away to a 59-47 victory to win their first county title since 2009.\n\n“I didn’t know what to do, so I just went around the corner and threw it up,” Sullivan said. “You get lucky sometimes, and it went in.”\n\nThe shot served as a springboard as Delta (9-3) went on a 21-6 run from there to seize control. And the contributions came from everywhere, like the 13 points and 16 rebounds from junior Adam Haynes, who has been inserted into the starting lineup with Kaleb Slaven out for the season with a broken foot.\n\nThen there was Ryley Pease’s 12 points and emotional spark, to go along with the steady backcourt of Sullivan (11 points) and Tanner Lambert (11 points).\n\nPease was actually pulled early in the second half and got an earful from head coach Ryan VanSkyock. The senior responded with seven of the final 10 points in that game-changing spurt.\n\n“We had a little talk,” VanSkyock said. “He’s our senior leader, and we have confidence in him, but sometimes we have to reel him back in. After the chewing I gave him, he came back and led our team. That’s what Ryley Pease is all about. He’s a great leader and a great motivator.”\n\nWapahani (8-4), which was vying for its fourth county title in the last five years, led most of the first half behind Peyton West, who finished with 23 points and five assists. His drive to the basket put Wapahani up 26-23 with 59 seconds left in the half and set up Sullivan’s shot.\n\nThe Eagles began hedging the Raiders’ ball screens in the second half. The difference was noticeable, and it carried over to the other end.\n\n“Then we really started attacking on offense,” Pease said.\n\nAlmost to a fault, as some ill-advised shots late in the game allowed Wapahani to creep within 51-44 with 1:42 left on West’s steal and layup. But Pease, Lambert and Sullivan combined to sink all six free throws to close out the game.\n\n“I really thought Adam Haynes stepped up, and Ryley Pease was outstanding tonight, he couldn’t miss a shot,” Sullivan said. “He really gave us a confidence boost and pumped everyone up.”\n\nAdded VanSkyock: “We had to treat the second half as 0-0. You come out and win the second half, you win the basketball game. Credit our kids, they played well defensively.”\n\nContact sports features writer Ryan O’Gara at (765) 213-5829.

Jordan was considered the best college basketball player in the country in 1983 when he came to Salina, Kansas, in late July as a member of the United States Pan American basketball team.\n\nJordan and his 11 teammates comprised a Pan Am team coached by Kansas State’s Jack Hartman. The team would win the gold medal in August 1983, at the Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. The Pan Am Games, featuring countries from North America, South America and Central America, are held every four years in the year prior to the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Salina Bicentennial Center became the site for the July 30, 1983, game between the Pan Am team and a group of NBA players coached by Cotton Fitzsimmons of the Kansas City Kings — the only appearance by the team in the United States that year.\n\nJordan always wanted to prove himself\n\nMichael Jordan was the best player on the Pan Am team’s star-studded roster, but was not the icon then that he would become later with the Chicago Bulls. Interest in Jordan has skyrocketed recently with him being the main focus of a current 10-part documentary called “The Last Dance,” which winds up its five-week run with Parts 9 and 10 Sunday night on ESPN.\n\nBut during his two weeks in Kansas at the Pan Am camp, the All-American from North Carolina was already showing that competitive fire, work ethic and unwavering drive for success that put him on the path to greatness.\n\nOn the Tuesday morning of game week, July 26, local media gathered in Ahearn Fieldhouse to watch the team go through practice. Jordan was slowed with a sore ankle and didn’t enjoy watching the morning practice from the sideline.\n\n“I don’t like sitting one bit,” Jordan said later. “It’s very hard for me to sit on the sidelines.\n\n“When I do, it’s tough.”\n\nWhether he was the best player for the Chicago Bulls or the North Carolina Tar Heels, or the 15-year-old who was cut from the varsity as a sophomore at Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, N.C., Jordan always believed in proving himself on the court. It was no different at the Pan Am camp.\n\n“When I start playing on a team, I feel I’m the lowest guy on the totem pole, and the only way I can get to the top is to work hard,” Jordan said during an interview with the Salina Journal that took place in the Manhattan Holidome lobby. “That’s how I approached playing on this team.”\n\nAt the time, Jordan’s plans were to keep the NBA on hold and stay in college for four years, something unheard of these days in an era of one-and-dones.\n\n“A lot of people thought I would turn pro after my sophomore year, but just because I had one good year doesn’t mean I’m ready for the NBA,” he said. “I’ve set a goal to play pro ball, but I also enjoy college life.”\n\nThe Bulls are thankful Jordan didn’t enjoy it that much. He left college after his junior year and they selected him in the 1984 NBA Draft.\n\nAnd the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nPan Am team loaded with talent\n\nJordan was the headliner of the team that came to Salina, but there was an array of talent on that 12-man roster, arguably the best-ever for a Pan Am team.\n\nThe 1983 team featured two future Hall of Famers (Jordan and Chris Mullin, who would miss the Pan Am Games after fracturing a foot in a later exhibition game in San Juan, Puerto Rico), and seven players (Jordan, Mullin, Michael Cage, Sam Perkins, Ed Pinckney, Mark Price and Wayman Tisdale) who would play more than a decade in the NBA. Five were selected as members of the 1984 U.S. Olympic Team — Jordan, Mullin, Tisdale, Leon Wood and Perkins, who was Jordan’s teammate at North Carolina.\n\nHalf of the team members could legitimately be called the greatest player of all-time at their respective colleges — North Carolina (Jordan), St. John’s (Mullin), Villanova (Pinckney), Georgia Tech (Price), Oklahoma (Tisdale) and Cal State Fullerton (Wood).\n\n“We watched maybe the greatest superstar of all time, of any sport,” said Dick Renfro, chairman of the Salina Chamber of Commerce’s Sports and Entertainment Committee that organized the game. “But look at all the talent that surrounded him — Tisdale, Price, Mullin, Perkins and others. You look back and, of course, a lot of their fame came afterwards, but to see who was there at the time, what happened and what they became is pretty awesome.”\n\nThat U.S. team would go on to win the gold medal in Caracas. During a 12-day period, it won eight straight games against the best competition from across the Americas. The Americans outscored their opponents by an average of more than 12 points a game.\n\nJordan led the Pan Am team in scoring (17.3 points per game), followed by Tisdale (15.5) and Perkins (13.1), who also averaged 7.1 rebounds.\n\nBut, before they flew to Latin America, they had an exhibition game to play in Salina. Just who would be on the NBA roster was a question that wouldn’t be answered until a day or two before the game was played.\n\nFour NBA players who had previously committed to play — former Kansas State stars Rolando Blackman and Mike Evans, Scott Wedman of Colorado and Mike Woodson of Indiana — missed the game for various reasons.\n\nThe four no-shows had Fitzsimmons scrambling for players. He did pick up a big name the day before the game when Alex English of the Denver Nuggets agreed to play. It should be noted that English, the NBA’s leading scorer in 1982-83, flew from his home in Columbia, S.C., to Kansas City and then rode with his teammates to Salina, all on Saturday, to play in the game.\n\nIn addition to English, the NBA team featured Clay Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers and Larry Drew, Joe C. Meriweather and Eddie Johnson of the Kansas City Kings. Former Kansas State player Jari Wills and ex-Kansas player Art Housey also were on the roster.\n\n'Where are the 30-second clocks?'\n\nTickets — 7,000 of them — went on sale July 14 at outlets in Salina, Hays, Junction City, Manhattan and Wichita. All but 600 of them were sold at $7, $5 and $3. It would be the largest crowd ever to watch a basketball game in Salina, excluding the Harlem Globetrotters.\n\nBut the game didn’t go off without a hitch. A few minutes before tipoff, with the crowd of 6,400 getting settled in, NBA team coach Fitzsimmons noticed something missing. Actually, two things.\n\n“I’m standing there with Cotton and Jack, at courtside watching the pregame, and Cotton looked at Jack and said, ‘Jack, where are the 30-second clocks?’ ” Renfro recalled. “Jack said, ‘Oh my God, the staff didn’t bring them.’ ”\n\nThere was no scorebook, either.\n\n“So I am looking around and I see Daryl Hoelting,” Renfro said. “He’s right there pretty close to courtside.\n\n“I run over and said, ‘Daryl, we’re in trouble. Can you help us out?’ ”\n\nHoelting, who was the Marymount College women’s basketball coach at the time, did help, making a quick trip to Smoot Gym to bring back two 30-second clocks and a scorebook.\n\n“He got here right before tipoff and got them set up,” Renfro said.\n\nThe game was competitive for the first 15 minutes before the Pan Am team opened up a 14-point lead at halftime. They would eventually wear down the NBA team and win by 35 points, 112-77.\n\nJordan led the way with a 30-point effort — 20 in the first half — delighting the crowd with a variety of acrobatic moves and dunks. He also gave the large crowd, and Hartman, a scare when he slipped and fell to the floor with 5:01 remaining in the game.\n\n“I hit a wet spot, that’s all,” Jordan said afterwards. “I knew right away it wasn’t serious.”\n\nImagine how the future of basketball could have changed if it had been.\n\n“I knew he had a lot of points. I didn’t realize he had that many,” said Clark Renfro, one of Dick Renfro’s three sons, who was a freshman at Kansas State at the time. “He was just a special player to watch.”\n\nTisdale, also a crowd favorite, scored 22 points, while Pinckney added 14 and Kentucky’s Jim Master 12 as the Pan Am team shot 55% from the field. Eddie Johnson scored 23 points for the NBA team and English had 18.\n\nAfter the game at a postgame meal in the Bicentennial Center, Clark Renfro was seated at a table with Jordan, Greg Stokes of Iowa and Wood of Cal State Fullerton.\n\n“He was just like one of the guys,” Clark Renfro said of Jordan. “And granted, it was a whole different era and he was basically a junior in college, but he was nice. He said he was majoring in geography at North Carolina.\n\n“We talked about Manhattan, Aggieville and the atmosphere in Manhattan and Chapel Hill. I just remember him being the nicest guy, but the other players knew; you could tell, they knew he was the man.”\n\nDick Renfro said that after expenses, a check for $14,300 was sent to USA Basketball, which had agreed to make some local donations — $100 to Marymount “for the shot clocks,” and $500 each to the Salina YMCA, Salina Special Olympics, Salvation Army and the Salina Recreation Commission.\n\n“And, I got a shirt and a Christmas card,” Renfro said with a smile.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2019/06/28/nba-tells-teams-that-coaches-challenges-are-coming/39635975/", "title": "NBA: Coaches likely to get 1 challenge per game next season", "text": "AP\n\nNBA coaches likely will be challenging one call per game next season.\n\nThe league told teams Friday that, pending expected approval by the board of governors on July 9, coaches may challenge a personal foul charged to their team, a called out-of-bounds violation, a goaltending violation or a basket-interference violation. No other call may be challenged.\n\n\"We anticipate this rule will be in effect in the NBA next season as a one-year pilot program,\" NBA Basketball Operations President Byron Spruell told teams in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press. ESPN first reported the memo's contents.\n\nThe NBA already has a call-challenge program in place in the G League and tinkered with it during summer league last year. It will be used during all three summer leagues this season — the four-team league in Sacramento and Salt Lake City that open Monday, and the one in Las Vegas that opens July 5.\n\nUnlike the NFL version of a challenge, there's no flag to be used and teams will not retain them even if successful. A team will have to call timeout and the coach \"must immediately signal for a challenge by twirling his/her index finger toward the referees,\" the memo said.\n\nA challenge must come immediately after the play and challenges of out-of-bounds calls, goaltending or basket interference will not be permitted in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or the last two minutes of overtime.\n\n\"As with other replay reviews, in order to overturn the event as called on the floor, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call was incorrect,\" the memo said.\n\nIf the challenge is unsuccessful, the team will lose its timeout. If the challenge is upheld, no timeout will be charged.\n\nAlso likely coming to the league: Instant replay can be triggered by officials in the review center in Secaucus, New Jersey, without the involvement of the on-court crew.\n\nThe league said it wants to give the replay center the authority to review whether a shot was a 2-pointer or 3-pointer without on-court crews asking for it, as well as the ability to review potential shot-clock violations. A courtside administrator would be added to the crew at the scorer's table to communicate with the replay center and then be the liaison to announce any immediate scoring changes.\n\nFor summer league only, there will be a \"transition take foul\" — one free throw and retention of the ball when a defender commits a take foul against any offensive player during a transition scoring opportunity but does not meet the criteria of a clear-path foul.\n\nAnd in Las Vegas, a new high-tech element will make its debut.\n\nWhat the NBA calls a \"connected basketball\" will sometimes be in use for those games. The NBA said it has been working with Spalding and other vendors to develop a basketball with a tracking chip inside, and prototypes will be tried out during the Vegas league. Some companies have been in the smart-ball game for a few years, offering users the chance to use apps to track their accuracy and other data.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/28"}]}

The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}]}

When the UDance executive board revealed the new record, the energy in the room bounced back as dancers cheered, hugged and cried.\n\n\"The anticipation is so overwhelming,\" said Sarah Turturro, who is a sophomore and a UDance engagement coordinator. \"It's amazing to see all of the hard work throughout the year pay off. The feeling is hard to put into words.\"\n\nThe best part about setting a new record is knowing that more kids and families will benefit from the B+ Foundation, said Sabrina Noboa, who has danced for 12 hours all four years of her college career.\n\n\"For the kids\"\n\nThe first thing you notice when you walk into the 12-hour dance marathon, UDance, is the fevered joy.\n\nThousands of University of Delaware students each March transform the Bob Carpenter Center into a massive dance floor, filled with a churning, swirling mass of Blue Hens raising money to fight childhood cancer.\n\nStudents wear shirts that read \"Live like Andrew\" and \"B+, It's not a grade it's an attitude\" as reminders of their mission to spread positivity.\n\nBut there is also a hint of sorrow to the event.\n\nFor children who are paired each year with UD student organizations by The Andrew McDonough B+ (Be Positive) Foundation, after the big party, it's often right back to fighting cancer.\n\nSometimes those kids, known as B+ Heroes, lose their battle with the disease, leaving behind grieving friends, family and UD students.\n\nJust last week, one such B+ Hero, Alex Scarpone, died at age 20, according to UDance organizers.

He was 14.\n\nThe nonprofit runs the B+ Heroes program, which is intended to make the children (and their siblings) feel special while putting them on a much-deserved pedestal.\n\nAndrew’s father, president of the foundation, said without UDance participants, the organization would not be able to fund cutting edge childhood cancer research or help families struggling to pay their hospital and other bills.\n\n\"They are literally saving and changing lives,\" he said in a statement. \"I could not be any more proud of my alma mater.”\n\nThe first UDance was held after Andrew died in 2007 and raised $8,000.\n\nIn 2015, in a major milestone, it raised more than $1.28 million. Last year it raised more than $2 million.\n\nTo date, UDance has raised $9.16 million for the fight against pediatric cancer, according to the event's organizers.\n\nWaller, who is the dance's media relations chair, said everyone has different reasons for participating. Her \"why\" is a 10-year-old girl named Kate.\n\nKate has a low-grade glioma or brain tumor.

Everybody works for that,” Wuest said.\n\nAfter winning his second state title Feb. 25 at 195 pounds at Dover High, where his four pins came in 32, 13, 36 and 87 seconds, Wuest was voted the DIAA individual tournament’s Most Outstanding Wrestler.\n\nContinuing that trend, while competing for Delaware at the recent NWCA/USAW National Scholastic Duals at Wabash College in Indiana, Wuest went 7-0 with six first-period pins and a forfeit.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: Hall-of-Famer Lambert dies\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS: Rosembert heads All-State track\n\n“He doesn’t really have a position that’s weak,” Smyrna coach Kurt Howell said of Wuest, “and he can pin you from anywhere. I’d put him up against anybody in the country and he might get beat but I’d roll the dice and say Tony could pin him, too.”\n\nWuest’s only losses this season were 9-3 to nationally ranked eventual champ John Borst, a Virginia Tech signee, of Sherando (Va.) in the semifinals of the Beast of the East, the December tournament at the University of Delaware that attracts many of the nation’s top teams and individuals (Wuest wrestled back for third), and a 13-8 decision at January’s Virginia duals. There, Wuest moved up to 220 pounds to take on South Dade’s nationally ranked Chei Hill because Smyrna needed a pin to have a chance at winning the dual meet against the Florida powerhouse. The Eagles eventually lost 35-27.\n\n“I don’t see any fear in him,” said Howell, the former unbeaten four-time state champion at Newark.\n\nWuest didn’t blink when given the challenge of taking on Hill.\n\n“If you looked at [Hill],” Howell said, “I think if I told anybody this is who you’re gonna wrestle and this is what you have to do they’d say ‘I’m gonna do what, against him?’ He just went out there with absolutely no fear. He went out there and he had the kid on his back and the kid was flat and bench-pressed Tony off his back with one arm. I think the only reason the referee didn’t call a pin was because Tony was trying to collect an arm or a leg and he couldn’t get anything. But the kid was flat on his back for probably two seconds.”\n\n“He was enormous,” Wuest said. “In my mind, I was like, this kid is gonna destroy me. But when you go to college they’re going to be depending on you to do stuff like that and I was, like, ‘I’ll suck it up and do it.’ I had him on his back.”\n\nOn varsity, Wuest was 22-9 as a freshman with 16 pins, 12 in the first period. He was 27-5 as a sophomore with 27 pins, 20 in the first period. That makes his career record 87-16 with an astounding 76 pins, 61 coming in the first period.\n\nWuest said he walks onto the mat confident in his abilities and willing to take chances. Though he may appear unorthodox at times, it pays off.\n\n“Cael Anderson, the coach at [NCAA champ] Penn State, always says ‘Just go out there and have fun’ and that’s what I do,” Wuest said. “I just go out there and have fun.\n\n“If something doesn’t work, I work my way out of it. I’ll throw somebody at practice and, if I end up on my back, so be it. People say ‘He’s funky.’ But if I get taken down I know I can come back because a lot of my moves are either five points [a takedown and near fall] or pins. I know that like 98 percent of the kids I wrestle, I can turn.”\n\nHis ability has roots in some early crossover training.\n\nWuest, whose dad Ronnie was a Smyrna wrestler, got his start in grappling sports early. Ronnie Wuest is a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt who coaches and competes in that martial art/combat sport, which involves ground fighting.\n\nHe owns and operates the Delaware Combat Sports and Self-Defense Academy with locations in Dover, Middletown, and Camden. From there, he also coaches the Top Team Youth Wrestling Club, in which Tony competed in his younger days. Tony also was involved at times in the Smyrna Little Wrestlers program.\n\nHis father is certain Tony’s Jiu-Jitsu training benefits him on the wrestling mat.\n\n“Absolutely and then some,” Ronnie Wuest said. “He has been training in Jiu-Jitsu since he was five or six years old and never stopped. His takedowns, hip movements, control and thorough understanding of the human nature of grappling responses is 100 percent due to his Jiu-Jitsu training with me.”\n\nTony admits that he began taking wrestling more seriously just before he got to high school and joined the competitive swirl inside Smyrna’s wrestling room, where older brother Ronnie, now a sophomore wrestler at McDaniel College, was also a standout. As a freshman, he won two of three varsity wrestle-offs for the starting spot.\n\n“Tony was just an average wrestler in middle school, maybe a little bit better than average,” Howell said. “His freshman year he started to come around a little bit. He was junior varsity [after losing his second wrestle-off] but you could see it coming and the last wrestle-off he ended up winning so he went to the conference tournament and lost in the semifinals to the boy from Sussex Tech [Riley Parker], but you could see in that match there were lots of possibilities.\n\n“The next week, man, he just lit it up in states.”\n\nIn that 2015 state individual tournament, Wuest won with four pins, the last over Middletown’s Erich Schneider, the top-seeded senior who had pinned his way to the finals.\n\n“It took me a little while to calm down from that,” said Wuest, who also played soccer and lacrosse as a Smyrna freshman before concentrating on wrestling.\n\nIn 2016, Wuest picked up two state-tournament falls before, 25 seconds into a semifinal match against Wilmington Charter’s Andrew Genett, he dislocated his elbow.\n\n“I didn’t want that to happen again,” he said. “Every tournament I went to I just said ‘Don’t get hurt.’ ”\n\nThis summer, Wuest hopes to expand his competitive opportunities and increase his exposure by wrestling, for the first time, at the Junior Nationals in Fargo, North Dakota.\n\nHe is being recruited by numerous NCAA Division I programs, with Maryland and Drexel among the early front-runners, and Ohio State, Bucknell and Lock Haven also showing serious interest.\n\n“I just want to keep moving along, I just want to get bigger and stronger,” said Wuest, who likely projects as a 197-pounder in college. “That could maybe break the barrier between me and the top five in the country.’’\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.

He never gets himself in trouble, and he’s constantly wrestling. If someone makes a mistake, he’s looking to take advantage. He’s relentless, and that makes a tough kid to beat.”\n\nThe Indy meet brought together all the schools not in the Henlopen or Blue Hen conferences.\n\nThe top four finishers at each of the 14 weight classes qualified for the state individual championships Friday and Saturday at Cape Henlopen in Lewes with others eligible for at-large selection.\n\n“Feels great,” Griffith said. “Had nerves going into it but felt good going into the finals, and my technique worked.’’\n\nSalesianum crowned six champions; Caravel, five; Sanford, two; and Wilmington Charter, one.\n\nHearling loss doesn't deter Wilmington Charter wrestler\n\nThere is no team title awarded though Salesianum outpointed the field.\n\nThe No. 1 seed won every title except at 170 pounds, though that wasn’t a big upset. No. 2 seed Jason Lamey and No. 1 Nolan Collins of Archmere had split two matches this season. Lamey won this time with a pin.\n\nBen Somerville gave Charter School of Wilmington its title at 285 pounds.\n\nSalesianum crowned Zach Spence at 112, Harry Latch at 138 and Will Brock at 148 and then got an upper-weights sweep from Colin Fowler at 182, Danny Stradley at 195 and Stephon Hutt at 220.\n\n“We performed very well today, Proud of the boys,” Sals coach Cameron Davis said. “We’ve had a good year, and all their hard work is paying off. We showed it today by crowning six champions and putting a couple more in the finals. They’re rolling right now, peaking at the right time.”\n\nThe Sals qualified all 14 wrestlers for states for the first time since Davis became coach in 2000.\n\n“Next week is the ultimate goal,” Latch said. “This is just a step along the way. Every match is an experience, and you get better every single time.”\n\nLeading the way was Spence, who won his fourth Independent title – “That was one of my goals,” he said – which was also a first under Davis. Spence now takes aim at his third state title before moving on to the University of Maryland next school year in the rugged Big Ten.\n\nCaravel’s five champs were Luke Poore (106), Ethan Gray (120), Alex Poore (126), Nicholas Hall (152) and Anthony Bernieri (160). The Bucs had three runners-up as well.\n\nLike Griffiths, Luke Poore is an eighth-grader who got three pins on his way to the title. He said his goal is to make history as a five-time Indy champ from the same school. Only Pat Atkinson (one title at Caravel and four at St. Mark's) has won five before.\n\n“Last weekend we were state runners-up,” Caravel coach Mike Welch said of the Division II team championships, “and I wasn’t sure how they’d respond this weekend. But a lot of them felt like they had unfinished business. It was nice to send eight to the finals. We never predicted that. A lot of them won matches against guys they lost to earlier in the season so that was good to see.\n\n“We had one eighth-grade champion, two ninth-grade champions [Alex Poore and Hall], a 10th-grade champion [Gray] and an 11th-grade champion [Bernieri]. I remind the kids all the time that it doesn’t matter how old you are or what grade you are, anyone can win.

On Saturday, he won the 126-pound title at the Henlopen Conference Wrestling Championships at Sussex Central.\n\n\"I probably won't be at the level I was before I got hurt,\" Stevens said of his chances going into next week's dual meet and individual state tournaments. \"But just to know that I'm somewhere close to there and still competing for the top spot ... it makes me confident.\"\n\nStevens tore a meniscus in his right knee days before last year's conference meet, but endured the pain and finished second in the Henlopen and third at 120 pounds in the DIAA Individual Wrestling Championships. He underwent surgery to repair the tear in March, and was ready for the Panthers' football season in August.\n\nBut then disaster struck against Caesar Rodney.\n\n\"When we wrestled CR, my knee got locked up and I couldn't bend it because my meniscus got stuck,\" Stevens said. \"The only way for it to bend was for me to have surgery.\"\n\nInstead of being repaired again, which would have required a lengthy recovery, the meniscus was removed this time.\n\n\"When they take it out, it's a lot faster,\" said Stevens, who was one of four Polytech wrestlers to win a conference title Saturday. \"I just have two small cuts in the back of my knee.\"\n\nTop-ranked Smyrna rolled to the team title, piling up 284 points to easily outdistance Polytech (194½), Milford (177) and CR (156½). The Eagles really won it on Friday, when all 14 of their wrestlers reached the semifinals.\n\n\"That says a lot about the balance of our team. I'm really happy about that,\" Eagles coach Kurt Howell said. \"We have a good guy in every weight class.\"\n\nSome of the Smyrna wrestlers who didn't qualify to make the trip likely would have been competitive, too. That depth makes the top-seeded Eagles the favorite to win the Division I title when Smyrna hosts the DIAA Dual Meet championships on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Just in the last week of practice, I had five real emotional and close wrestle-offs that ended up as one-point matches,\" Howell said. \"That's a deep team when you get that. It's a balanced team.\"\n\nSix Smyrna wrestlers reached the finals, with three – Chase Archangelo (113), Ronnie Wuest (170) and Marquelle Bennett (195) claiming Henlopen crowns.\n\nWuest edged Lake Forest's Brian Thomson 3-2 in the Milford Invitational in December, but the rematch was more decisive. Wuest got off to a better start and scored a 9-3 decision this time.\n\n\"He's not in our division, so you wrestle him once or maybe twice a season,\" Wuest said of Thomson. \"He could be practicing just for a moment like this.\n\n\"I was telling myself, 'Go out there and act like you want to dominate the whole match.' I can't just wait until the third period like I always do to rack up points.\"\n\nIn addition to Stevens, Andrew Schmeusser (120), Josh Price (132) and Mark Mullnack (220) won for Polytech. Schmeusser, a senior, met Smyrna sophomore Cole Sebastianelli for the first time in his final and grinded out a 5-0 decision.\n\n\"I was just pushing the pace, keeping the intensity up and trying to control every position,\" Schmeusser said. \"You can watch him, but until you wrestle him you don't really know what he feels like. I had to feel him out.\"\n\nLucas Monson of Woodbridge was named the tournament's outstanding wrestler after edging Sussex Central's Justin Bennett 3-2 in the 152-pound final, the final match of the day. The Blue Raiders also got a title from Tyreq Nelson at 145.\n\nTwo finals were decided by injury default. Cape Henlopen's J.J. Currie and Smyrna's Eli Hutchinson were tied at 2 in the second period at 160 pounds when Hutchinson was injured. CR's Mason Harrington led Milford's Cameron Hayes 6-0 in the third period at 106 when Hayes could no longer continue.\n\nMilford's Bart Dalious (138), CR's Michael Clavier (182) and Dover's Isaiah Abrams (285) also won. The top six finishers in each weight class qualified for the DIAA Individual meet, to be held next Friday and Saturday at Cape Henlopen High. So work remains to be done.\n\n\"It was a good fight. I loved it,\" Abrams said after his tense, 2-1 win over CR's Troy McNally in triple overtime. \"And now it's back to the drawing board on Monday.\"\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.
